I suppose when you’re referring to “animals”, you’re thinking of lions, tigers, and bears (oh my). However, it’s easy to forget that the vast, vast majority of all animals are invertebrates, most of which are utterly harmless.

To put things into perspective, 3% of the world’s known animal species are vertebrates. Of those, tens of thousands are just fish, and not the dangerous kind. Then, the majority of mammals are bats, rodents, and shrews. Any reptile except some crocodilians, venomous/constricting snakes, snapping turtles and a few dangerous lizards (like Gila monsters and large monitor lizards) is pretty feasible to take down. All amphibians except poisonous frogs are easy prey.

Therefore, most vertebrates are harmless, leaving about 1%, most likely a lot less, that are anything to contend with. Even if you add the handful of dangerous insects and arachnids, all jellyfish, and a few other harmful invertebrates, we’d still be in the top 3%. Parasitoids don’t count, since “in a fight”, they would be detached from the host and easily exterminable.

TL;DR: the overwhelming majority of animals are completely harmless or easily beaten in a fight, so humans would come somewhere in the top few percent of over a million species.
