Plenty of cryptids technically do “exist”, only they’re misinterpreted things we already knew about.

Bigfoot, Yeti etc. \- probably a bear.

Mothman \- an owl.

Flatwoods Monster \- also an owl.

Mokele Mbembe \- possibly a softshell turtle.

Mermaids \- manatees in some cases.

Beast of Gevaudan \- either a dog(s), a wolf(ves) or an escaped hyena(s).

Bunyip \- leopard seal.

Chupacabra \- canid with mange.

The list goes on.

But do you mean “real” as in actually new, undocumented species of animals (or late-surviving “extinct” animals)? In that case, I’d probably go with extant thylacines, they seem about the most down-to-earth, and the least absurd.
