From spotted hyenas to sun bears, there are lot of candidates, but I’m going to go with manta rays.

If you were to take a logarithmic graph, and plot every species of animal on it based on their body mass and brain mass, it’d tell you each one’s Encephalization Quotient, or EQ. In general, more intelligent animals have higher EQs (however, there are caveats to this, as dinosaurs, including birds, seem to have much denser neural tissue than mammals).

If you then took a close look at this graph, you’d notice something quite fascinating. Manta rays would be apart from all the other fish, instead clustered among the mammals. The EQ of the giant oceanic manta ray is higher than that of the brown rat, which - for a fish - is very impressive.

However, relative brain size alone an intelligent animal does not make. Mantas are also demonstrate their intellect through behaviour. In 2016, [research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z "link.springer.com") was done on manta rays where captive individuals were presented with a mirror. This “mirror test” has been given to many animal species, but few have passed.

The idea is that if an animal recognizes itself in the mirror, it might be self-aware (this is another thing in ethology which has caveats to consider, but it’d take too long to explain them here). The tested manta rays certainly seemed to recognize themselves, acting very differently to how they would with another individual:

The researchers found that, I quote:

> The manta rays did not show signs of social interaction with their mirror image. However, frequent unusual and repetitive movements in front of the mirror suggested contingency checking; in addition, unusual self-directed behaviors could be identified when the manta rays were exposed to the mirror.

Overall, while it certainly isn’t conclusive proof that manta rays are self-aware, it does at least show that they seem to be more intelligent than any other fish studied thus far. They show plenty of signs of intelligence in other aspects of their behaviour, such as their curiosity and deep social bonds.

I think that all this goes to show that being able to manufacture and use tools is not as importance to the evolution of powerful brains as some might think. Anatomically, a manta ray couldn’t be less suited to tool use, and yet it is a remarkably smart creature.
