In my opinion, Alfred Russell Wallace would be up there.

Born in 1823, in Wales, this Englishman is one of the most famous naturalists in history. He co-invented the idea of natural selection along with Darwin, and discovered the biogeographical border now known as the Wallace Line. A whole region of Indonesia, Wallacea, is named after him.

In 1848, he decided to embark on an expedition to the then-mysterious Amazon rainforest, with nobody else except for his friend Henry Walter Bates, later discoverer of Batesian mimicry. This was extremely daring, and yet Wallace survived a full four years collecting specimens in the Amazon - Bates spent a further seven before returning to England.

During the last year of his trip, Alfred’s brother Edward joined the two friends in the Amazon. Tragically, they both caught yellow fever - Edward died, but Wallace recovered and soldiered on.

On the voyage home, in 1852, Wallace was aboard the brig Helen. After 26 days at sea, the ship caught fire, and sank. Not only was this a terrifying near-death experience for him, but the vast majority of his most interesting and valuable specimens were lost.

In a letter to his friend, Richard Spruce, he describes poignantly the losses:

> My collections however were in the hold and were irrevocably lost. And now I begin to think, that almost all the reward of my four years of privation and danger were lost. What I had hitherto sent home had little more than paid my expenses and what I had in the “Helen” I calculated would realise near £500 \[nearly $40,000\]. But even all this might have gone with little regret had not far the richest part of my own private collection gone also. All my private collection of insects and birds since I left Pará was with me, and contained hundreds of new and beautiful species which would have rendered (I had fondly hoped) my cabinet, as far regards American species, one of the finest in Europe.

You’d think that such a catastrophe, the ruin of one’s entire life work, would be pretty demotivating for a man. Not so for Wallace; in that same letter, written just two months after the shipwreck, he considers going to the Andes next, or the Philippines.

Eventually, he settled on Indonesia and the surrounding regions - one of the least-explored places in the world at the time. During this expedition, which started in 1854, Wallace was incredibly prolific, collecting:

*   110,000 insects
*   7,500 shells
*   8,050 bird skins
*   410 mammals and reptiles

Not only this, but he is credited with the discovery of over 5,000 species!! That’s got to be a world record. In any case, the conditions on the trip were, as you’d imagine, far from luxurious. Most of the time, Wallace slept in tiny wooden huts, and ate what the natives did - including fruit bat.

One time, he and several local friends had to altercate with a huge python which entered Wallace’s hut. It was allegedly over 4 metres in length, and he described it as being “well capable of swallowing a dog or a child.” This plate shows the python being unceremoniously extracted from the roof of the hut.

The python’s skin is preserved today in a museum owned by the Linnean Society. The skins collected by Wallace and his loyal sidekick Ali (who later voluntarily adopted the surname Wallace) were under constant threat of loss. Many rotted, and on some islands they were plagued by ravenous stray dogs in the night who stole their specimens.

Small animals were a big problem too. In 1858, four years into his trip, Wallace fell terribly ill with an attack of malarial fever. The illness was severely debilitating and he was confined to lie in his hut on a remote Indonesian isle for some time.

And, believe it or not, it was during this time - of all times - that Wallace conceived the theory of evolution by natural selection, completely independent of Darwin! He wrote about it to Charles Darwin, who - unbeknownst to Wallace - had long been developing the same hypothesis in secret, for fear of ridicule.

The two naturalists corresponded for years, and later became friends, or at least pen pals. Eventually, after a staggering 8 years in what was then a godforsaken, unexplored corner of the world, Alfred Russell Wallace decided to return to England in 1862, having become a rich man from selling his prized specimens.

Seven years after coming home, Wallace wrote his world-famous book, perhaps the greatest of all the great Victorian travelogues - The Malay Archipelago. I myself have read it, and strongly recommend it. The book was enormously popular when it was published and is one of the only books which has never gone out of print, at least for anything like 150 years.

Again, his remarkable prolificness is clear - he, up until his death, wrote over 1,000 articles and 22 books; many of them defending the theory of natural selection from creationist skeptics. Many of his books are also still available today.

Although he was not quite done travelling through wildernesses (he later explored the Rocky Mountains in Colorado), Wallace largely settled down after the end of his eight-year adventure. He died in 1913, at the age of 90, of natural causes.

I think it’s clear to see that Alfred Russel Wallace was a man of many virtues - courageous, determined, optimistic, modest and above all very hard-working. His brushes with death in remote jungles make him, for me, one of history’s most badass scientists.
