Iâ€™ve never heard of them doing so, and I highly doubt they do.

In the wild, hyenas and lions wage figurative war on eachother, and no benign contact is documented, let alone interspecial mating.

In the wild, no such interactions could occur before flesh and hair starts flying, and hyenas and lions would never be allowed in the same enclosure in captivity.
