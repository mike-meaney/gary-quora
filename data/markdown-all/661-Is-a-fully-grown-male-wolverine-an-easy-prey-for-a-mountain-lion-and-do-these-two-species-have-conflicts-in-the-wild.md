Wolverines are not easy prey items, as they're essentially the North American version of honey badgers. However, such encounters do occur.

From [The Wolverine Foundation - A non-profit organization comprised of wildlife scientists with a common interest in the wolverine.](http://wolverinefoundation.org/ "wolverinefoundation.org"):

> Where wolverines overlap with wolves, the risks and benefits become apparent; potentially more food from scavenging wolf-killed prey, balanced by risk of becoming unlucky prey (Burkholder 1962, Boles 1977, Gill 1978, Banci 1987). Similarly, where mountain lions occur, wolverines face similar tradeoffs (Hornocker and Hash 1981, Banci 1987, Copeland 1996).

Here's something from another study, [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322685482\_Are\_pumas\_subordinate\_carnivores\_and\_does\_it\_matter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322685482_Are_pumas_subordinate_carnivores_and_does_it_matter "www.researchgate.net") :

> Likewise, it is not uncommon for wolverines to be killed by wolves and mountain lions

In short, no and yes.
