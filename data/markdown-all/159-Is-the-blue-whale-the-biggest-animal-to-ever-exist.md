At least as we currently understand it, most likely yes. The largest recorded blue whales weighed approximately 190,000 kilograms and measured 29.9 metres in length. Keep that in mind. There are two animals which at least some scientists have proposed could have equaled or even exceeded its mass.

The first of these animals is the Lilstock ichthyosaur, which currently lacks a published scientific name. It’s estimated to be 20–26 metres long, but it was likely significantly thicker than a blue, so a similar weight is possible.

It was not a plankton-eater, as far as we know, but probably not a fish/squid-eater either, since it was toothless. Instead, it probably sucked up crustaceans from the seabed like a grey whale, using benthic suction.

The second “candidate” is the Triassic Kraken. This organism is claimed to exist by one paleontologist, Mark McMenamin, and one paleontologist alone. The hypothesis is based on rather flimsy evidence, but it is at least somewhere within the realms of plausibility.

The idea was based on the discovery of 205 million year-old ichthyosaur bones which were arranged in a strange pattern, and had sucker-like marks on them. McMenamin thinks that they were deliberately organized like that by some kind of gigantic intelligent cephalopod. Like I said, flimsy evidence.

Extrapolating from the size of the alleged sucker marks, this thing - if it existed - would have been 30 metres long and weighed 200 tons, making it the largest ever animal. That’s assuming it has the proportions of a modern giant squid.

So, the Lilstock ichthyosaur is - as of now - too poorly studied for us to make an accurate mass estimate, and there’s little evidence to suggest that the Triassic Kraken existed. Unless new evidence pops up, it’s safe to say that the blue whale is the largest-ever animal known to science.

Thanks for reading, everyone, and have a great day.
