Ammonicera minortalis

This is the smallest one I can think of.

This water snail measures 0.32 millimeters in diameter, and is the world’s smallest mollusc.

There are possibly other smaller species beginning with A, but they’d be in the little-studied class Myxozoa and most likely very hard to find on the Internet.
