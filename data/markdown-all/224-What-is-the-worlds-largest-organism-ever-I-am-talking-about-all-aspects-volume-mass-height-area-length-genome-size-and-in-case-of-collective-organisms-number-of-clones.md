## What is the world's largest organism ever? I am talking about all aspects: volume, mass, height, area, length, genome size, and (in case of collective organisms) number of clones.

In terms of mass and volume, it’s generally thought that the quaking aspen is the world’s largest organism. This tree can grow tens of thousands of separate trunks from its roots, forming vast “forests” which are actually just a colony of the same, genetically identical organism.

The largest such colony is known as Pando, and it’s found in central Utah. It’s estimated that are 40,000 “stems” of this one tree, which would collectively weigh around 6,000 tonnes. Pando spans about half a square kilometre in terms of land area.

Quaking aspens aren’t the only plants which form clonal colonies, though, and they might not be the biggest. One such competitor is Neptune grass, an aquatic plant found throughout the Mediterranean Sea. It produces flowers under the water, and even fruits, which are known as “olives of the sea”.

In 2006, a massive Neptune grass colony was discovered off the coast of Ibiza, in the Balearic Islands. It stretched more than eight kilometres over to Formentera, a different island, meaning it may well surpass Pando in surface area. It’s also the oldest known living organism in the world, seemingly dating back to over 100,000 years ago!

If you’re looking for the biggest organism by land area, though, look no further than Armillaria ostoyae. It’s possible that it gets heavier and more voluminous than the previous two, too! A. ostoyae is a colonial mushroom, mainly found on North America’s Pacific coast, but also native to parts of East Asia.

In Oregon’s Strawberry Mountains, you can find a colony which has been beautifully named “the Humongous Fungus”. Covering an immense area of over nine square kilometres, the upper estimates for its overall mass are around 35,000 tons. If it really is this big, the mushroom would absolutely dwarf any aspen colony.

So, that’s the biggest organism in terms of area, and therefore probably length too. The three previous are also contenders for the largest in mass, volume, and number of clones. The only two criteria in your question left to fill are height and genome size.

Height is an obvious one; the coast redwood. This iconic coniferous tree ranges across the coast of California. The tallest ever specimen, nicknamed Hyperion, is nearly 116 metres tall, and if you included the roots that number would be at least a few metres higher. The trunk can measure a staggering 9 metres in diameter.

Lastly, genome size. The largest confirmed genome studies thus far is that of the flower Paris japonica, which is endemic to the montane forests of Japan. Each of its cells contains 149 billion base pairs of DNA - for comparison, the human genome only has around 3.1 billion, a fiftieth of the flower’s number.

It’s not known for sure why this little plant is so genetically complex, although it probably stems (pun intended) from the fact that it’s a hybrid species, the amalgamation of four others. There is actually an amoeba, Polychaos dubium, which may have a jaw-dropping 670 billion base pairs, but this research is dubious.

There you have it - a 6,000 tonne tree with 40,000 trunks, a 100,000 year old patch of underwater grass, a mushroom colony the size of a small town, a redwood taller than the Statue of Liberty, and a dainty flower who has fifty times more genes than a human. It sure is a strange world we live in.
