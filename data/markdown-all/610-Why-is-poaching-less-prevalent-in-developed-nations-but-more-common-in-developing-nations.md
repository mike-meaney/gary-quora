A few reasons I can think of.

*   More people are driven to become poachers in developing countries. Most elephant poachers are people in desperate situations.
*   Developing counties typically have more wildlife, especially large wildlife.
*   Similar to my last point, poaching did occur in today's developed nations, but now the poached species are completely wiped out.
*   Products of poaching are usually sold to people in developed areas. Animals elsewhere are more exotic to them.
