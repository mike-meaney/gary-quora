In Africa, rhinoceroses are what’s called keystone species - they are crucial for the upholding of the ecosystem. Technically, all species are important ecologically, as the removal of one causes change, and for life - change is bad. However, a keystone species is one which stands out as playing a vital role.

White rhinoceroses

Grassland habitats are fundamentally lacking in nutrients, at least in the soil. That’s one of the reasons why they don’t subside to forest. Some animals, like wildebeest, eat the long, nutrient-poor grass and rely on their powerful digestive systems to process the vegetation.

In contrast, other animals like gazelles eat “sweet grass”, the most nutrient-rich of savannah grasses. In order for any viable concentration of sweet grass to exist in a certain place, there must be a reasonably dense nutrient content in the soil. One of the prime factors which recycles broken-down nutrients into the ground is dung - however, there is usually not enough of it in one place.

White rhino midden

However, rhinos are known for defecating in middens - preset sites where all dung is deposited. These exist for the purpose of being regular, fixed stations where other rhinos can gather information about their peers, but also have the consequence of putting a lot of nutrients into the soil in one place - perfect for sweet grass.

This habit of creating middens is something not seen in black rhinos, which are the less endangered of Africa’s two rhinoceros species. Rhinos are as important to the African savannah ecosystem as any animal, more so in fact, and are - additionally - great for the economy by drawing in tourists, and fundamentally deserve the right to live in the first place.
