Everyone Dies

Apep, also known as Apophis, would swallow the sun. As one would imagine, that wouldn’t be great. In 8.2 minutes, photosynthesis would stop and the planet would freeze.

And even if he didn’t, the Bakunawa from Filipino mythology would swallow the moon, greatly speeding up the Earth’s rotation and destabilizing its axial tilt, which in turn would screw up the climate.

Then again, maybe the Norse mythical wolves, Skoll and Hati, would beat both dragons to it and devour the Sun and moon themselves.

Ignoring those, there are still many more flavours in which the apocalypse may come. Maybe it will be brought by the Beast, from the book of Revelation. It would gather the world’s kings to Armageddon, and the end times would come.

Or perhaps it would be the Tandayag, of Batak folklore, a titanic crab (or sometimes a whale/dragon) which, when it enters the “navel of the world”, causes a global apocalyptic flood.

However, the main problem is merely one of space. There are hundreds of thousands of different cultures and ethnic groups in this world and almost every one of them has their own menagerie of mythological creatures.

Accounting for past societies, the number increases to millions, and at the end of the day there is simply not enough space on this Earth to fit the innumerable folkloric creatures that have been imagined.
