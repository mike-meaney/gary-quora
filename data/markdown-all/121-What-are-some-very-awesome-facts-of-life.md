We are life’s “Plan B”

The chances are that practically every life form you’ve ever seen is multicellular. Every person, dog, reptile, fish, insect, spider, worm, slug, tree, blade of grass, every bird and every lump of mould, each contains countless cells. It’s tempting to think that this is the grand culmination of a long and gradual evolutionary march since life’s inception.

Just five years ago, we found out that that’s not true.

You may have heard of the Ediacaran biota. This consisted of ecosystems of early multi-celled organisms - beyond that, their identity isn’t known. They’ve been variously classified as animals, algae, fungi - even as none of the above, as some unknown kingdom of life. The Ediacaran biota existed about 600 million years ago.

With “creatures” (if they can even be called that) so primitive and unrecognizable, surely this was life’s first leap to multicellularity, a pioneering step in its history? No.

A staggering 2.1 billion years ago, there was an entirely different guild of multi-celled organisms, four times more ancient than the Ediacaran biota, and these guys definitely don’t belong anywhere on our evolutionary timeline. They are the Francevillian biota, discovered in 2014.

The organisms in the Francevillian biota are far, far too bizarre for us to classify, but they each had many cells and grew up to 17 centimetres in length. They all died out due to a global drop in oxygen levels, but if they didn’t, I can guarantee you that Earth would literally look like an alien planet.

Also, having had four times as much time to evolve, think of how staggeringly complex and advanced they’d be by now. It’s only because the Francevillian organisms died out that multicellular organisms resembling anything like the ones we have today exist - including humans.

One’s brain starts to hurt even more when you realize that there could be another league of complex organisms even older than these guys just waiting to be discovered. It took us 200 years of paleontology to find out about the Francevillian biota, after all, and I have a feeling that there’s a lot more to be discovered.
