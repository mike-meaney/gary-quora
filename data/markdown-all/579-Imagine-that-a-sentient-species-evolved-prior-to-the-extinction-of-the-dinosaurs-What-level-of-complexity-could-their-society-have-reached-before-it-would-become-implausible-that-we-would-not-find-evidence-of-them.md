## Imagine that a sentient species evolved prior to the extinction of the dinosaurs. What level of complexity could their society have reached before it would become implausible that we would not find evidence of them today?

If you want to be more technically correct, I would use “sapient” instead of “sentient”. To be strictly accurate, a sentient organism is just one which can experience sensations. In that sense, a plant could even be said to have limited sentience.

Now, to your question. I’ve actually written on a similar topic before - in [Gary Meaney's answer to What if there was another intelligent species on Earth that lived before humans and went to colonize the stars before the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs?](https://www.quora.com/What-if-there-was-another-intelligent-species-on-Earth-that-lived-before-humans-and-went-to-colonize-the-stars-before-the-asteroid-that-wiped-out-the-dinosaurs/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") - way back close to the time I joined Quora, in which I spoke about a fringe hypothesis that there were Permian sophonts.

Alright, time to suggest something outrageous. So, there are three known ways a biological system can store information:

1.  Through a genome, below the individual level
2.  Through memory, on the individual level
3.  Through culture, above the individual level

Potentially, and I mean potentially, each of these methods could eventually lead to intelligence. We happen to be categorized into the second one, which I suspect is the most common in the universe. However, let us imagine that before the K-Pg extinction, there was an organism with what I’m going to call genetic sapience.\*

You could say that eusocial insects like ants or termites, or some colonial organisms like dictyostelid slime moulds, have a rudimentary form of genetic consciousness. These organisms have a very simple nervous system (or none for the slime moulds), but they can perform complex tasks through information stored in the gene pool.

These behaviors are instinctive and heritable - as Dawkins would say, extended phenotypes. Individual ants don’t have any regard for themselves or their survival, but a colony can act almost as a single organism.

With all this in mind, it is not impossible that there exists a species which could be conscious, of human-level intellect and have complex societies, but have little need for the likes of roads and complex tools. They would essentially act like a very intelligent ant or termite colony, which don’t leave much fossil trace of their architectural activities.

A sapient organism of this kind would have a self-awareness which extends over the whole colony, not just individuals. Its memory would be homogeneous for every individual and each individual would remember things from the point of view as the whole colony.

Note that this concept has not been put forth by a professional biologist, including myself. I heard it from someone once, merely as a fun speculation on intelligent life in outer space. Also note that the chance of this actually occurring in Earth’s history is infinitesimally small; in fact, I would - if forced to choose - be willing to bet my life that it never happened here.

However, what’s important (and relevant to the question) is that it’s technically possible, it’s conceivable. There are no factors which would have made it unable to evolve in a pre-Mesozoic Earth.

TL;DR: It is plausible, although extremely, extremely unlikely, that an organism having intelligence extending over a whole colony of individuals existed on Earth at some point. Such a species could have a very complex society, culture etc., but it wouldn’t necessarily need a lot of tools, or to modify its environment, the kind of things which could be preserved in the rocks.
