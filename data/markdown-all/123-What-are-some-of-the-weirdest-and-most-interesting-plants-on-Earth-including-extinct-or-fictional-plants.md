My list won’t have any extinct or fictional species, but hopefully you’ll be satisfied with these modern-day, real-world green wonders.

*   Javan cucumber: The seeds of this Southeast Asian vine are perhaps the world’s most remarkable - they have attached to them two specialized leaves. When the seeds are released, they act as aerodynamic wings, allowing them not only to glide but to climb, dip, stall and accelerate. In the highly competitive rainforest, being able to disperse so far is a huge advantage.

*   Marcgravia evenica: Another vine, it has peculiar, bowl-shaped leaves. Why this structure? It’s because M. evenica is only pollinated by nectar-eating bats, which of course navigate by echolocation. Sound waves bounce off the unique leaves exceptionally well, ensuring that the pollinators will be able to find the plant, passing on its genes.

*   Nepenthes lowii: If you’ve heard of a pitcher plant, you’ll probably know that they’re carnivorous. That’s true - most of the time. This species is unique in that, rather than insects, it feeds on animal droppings. It secretes little sugary beads on its “lid”. Tree shrews love to eat these beads, and, due to their fast metabolism, defecate in the pitcher, unknowingly giving it a meal.

*   Living stones: Can you spot the plants in the photo below? The 37 species in the genus Lithops, known as living stones, have some remarkable camouflage. They have only a pair of leaves, which are very bulbous and grey-brown. Hence, they look remarkably like rocks, and can blend in perfectly in stony environments. This, of course, is where they get their name.

*   Birdcatcher tree: Also known as the parapara, this small tree is found on Pacific islands. It gets its name from its rather sinister method of reproduction. The birdcatcher tree’s seeds are extremely sticky, and birds which visit the tree get covered in them. They clog up the feathers, preventing the bird from flying and causing it to starve to death. The tree then grows on the bird’s carcass.

It was nice to answer on plants for a change, as they’re definitely far more varied and weird than they get credit for. For another of my answers in a similar vein, you might want to read [Gary Meaney's answer to What living beings can be considered masters of mimicry?](https://www.quora.com/What-living-beings-can-be-considered-masters-of-mimicry/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com").
