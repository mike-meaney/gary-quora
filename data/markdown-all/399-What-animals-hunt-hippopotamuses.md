While an adult hippo could butcher an average Nile crocodile, hippopotamus calves are vulnerable to crocodile attacks.

Although some juveniles can be quite plucky, amusingly so:

Packs of spotted hyenas can and do kill adult hippopotami, and it has been scientifically documented. However, there is very little photographic record of such behaviours as they’re rare and hyenas are a criminally little-studied species.

The most common non-human predators of fully grown hippos are lions, who can take down adults in prides. Sometimes male lions attempt to tackle ones on their own but almost invariably fail.

The biggest enemies of hippos are of course humans. Hippos are poached for their meat and teeth, hunted by tourists, and threatened by problems such as urbanization, expansion of agricultural land, and climate change-induced drought.

All that was referring to the species Hippopotamus amphibius. The other hippo species, the pygmy hippo, is very poorly studied. However, it’s believed that it’s preyed on by leopards, crocodiles and African rock pythons. It too is illegally poached and threatened by habitat loss.
