There are many proposed reasons why cetaceans beach themselves, and in most (but not all cases), it’s probably not intentional. Here are the putative explanations.

Note that these are all still hypotheses and none are universally accepted. Potentially all of them could be true at once.

*   Echolocation isn’t great for picking up very smooth, horizontal surfaces, like gently sloping coastlines, and whales accidentally crash into beaches because they don’t know that they’re there.
*   Perhaps whales use the Earth’s magnetic field to navigate. When solar storms cause geomagnetic disruptions, the whales’ senses are messed with and the disoriented creatures end up stranded.
*   Whales follow their prey - i.e. fish and squid - up currents, until they get too close to the shore and can’t get back. This has been proposed for strandings in Tasmania and mainland Australia.
*   Large whales are following smaller, nimbler dolphins and porpoises into shallow water, in the hopes of food or even altruistic protection from danger, and find themselves stuck in the shallows.
*   The rapid pressure changes caused by military sonar causes cetaceans to get hemorrhages, tearing the tissues around the ears and brain. This leads to beachings.
*   Sonar can also apparently cause bubbles to form in the blood of whales, causing decompression sickness or the bends. How this happens is still poorly understood, but it could be a culprit in stranding.

In some instances, cetaceans will beach themselves deliberately. In Argentina, killer whales intentionally lunge onto the shore in order to grab pinnipeds which would otherwise be out of reach. This is, however, not apparently dangerous, as there are no recorded attempts of this leading to stranding.

Terrifying, right? Anyway, thanks for the request and I hope this answers your question.
