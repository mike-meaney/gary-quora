No other land carnivore can take down bigger prey than these two guys, the African lion, Panthera leo, and the spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta.

Both of these predators are well capable of bringing down massive animals. Most of the time, they’ll only go as far as Cape buffalo:

But in harsh times, African elephants may also be taken:

If, in your eyes, size makes the ultimate land carnivore, then that honour goes to the Kodiak bear, Ursus grizzlius middendorffi. The largest recorded one of these guys weighed 751 kilograms, or 1,650 pounds.

Kodiaks are famous because they’re huge, and size and strengths makes lions and hyenas the best at tackling large prey, but is that really fair?

Maybe predators should be judged by success rate. After all, only about 1 in 5 lion hunts succeed, and much less than that when they’re hunting elephants. As far as I know, the most successful predator is the dragonfly, Order Odonata.

However, I’m more of a mammalogist, I don’t really do insects much, so feel free to correct me if I’m wrong. Anyway, dragonflies catch about 90% of the insects in the vicinity, far more than most large predators.

So, those are our three categories - power, size and success. But who takes these crowns in the seas?

The most powerful ocean predator is the killer whale (Orca), Orcinus orca. There are several ecotypes of killer whales, but the largest are the Antarctic type A killer whales, which can bring down seals, sharks and whales.

The largest active predator in the oceans in the sperm whale, Physeter macrocephalus. A bull sperm whale is probably the only animal - aside from humans - that would pose a threat to the average killer whale pod, and they’ve been found with giant squid beaks in their stomachs.

To be honest, I’m not actually sure what the most successful predator in the ocean is, I don’t tend to do much marine biology. However, my mammal-centric mind would bet on the killer whale.

Thanks for asking!

Edit: Many, many, many people have stated that tigers are more capable than lions at taking down large prey. While a lone lion would be cobbled in strength and ferocity by a tiger of similar numbers, the lions’ social habits enable it to tackle larger prey than any observed tiger. Yes, there are multiple records of Bengal tigers taking down large Asian elephants, there is one recorded incident in which a pride of lions in the Savute Marsh in Botswana hunted and killed an adult bull African savannah elephant, which outsized any of the Asian variety. I'm not saying that a tiger is incapable of theoretically killing an animal of the same size, but if I am to stay true to my scientific principles then I must base this answer only on real evidence.

A significantly lower number stated that polar bears are bigger than Kodiak bears. While it is true that, on average, a polar bear would be bigger than a grizzly, individuals of the middendorfi ssubspecies are usually larger than polars.
