The Big Five most commonly referred to is as follows; the Cape buffalo, lion, African leopard, African elephant, and rhinoceros (black or white). The term was coined back when a “safari” usually meant a trophy hunting expedition, as they were the most dangerous of the African mammals to hunt.

Nowadays, they’re often the five animals which tourists on safari in Africa are most eager to observe. While Cape buffalo are aggressive and dangerous to encounter on foot, they’re very common in many national parks and not much to look at. Because of that, I believe some areas have replaced them with the cheetah.

The Big Five aren’t, as you might think, elusive creatures to find - rather, they’re pretty easy to encounter since they’re big and found out in the open. Additionally, pretty much every safari jeep in a given wildlife reserve will be on the lookout for them, and safari guides can communicate the whereabouts of prized animals through radio.

Spend a week or two on safari in somewhere like Kenya, and you’ll most likely see the Big Five, although leopards aren’t quite guaranteed. I’ve been on safari in Africa a few times, including this summer, and every time I’ve seen all Five, usually several times over.

Some national parks and wildlife reserves in Africa don’t have all the Big Five, but do have some animals which are hard to see elsewhere. Samburu National Reserve, in Kenya, is one such place, and it has its own “Special Five”: reticulated giraffe, Grevy’s zebra, Somali ostrich, gerenuk and Beisa oryx.

At the end of the day, the Big Five is essentially a marketing ploy, and an extremely successful one at that. While the lion, leopard, buffalo, elephant and rhino are spectacular, there are plenty of other African species which I’d be just as excited to see.
