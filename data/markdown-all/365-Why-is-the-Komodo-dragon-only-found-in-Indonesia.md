Your other answer is actually incorrect. Komodo dragons, as of our current understanding, originated on the Australian continent. The earliest Komodo dragon bones we have are 3 million years old and from Queensland.

So, apparently Komodo dragons migrated across the Sahul landbridge, then made its way westward across Indonesia. Why aren’t there any Komodo dragons in Australia anymore? Nobody really knows. They disappeared around 300,000 years ago, long before humans arrived in the region.

This paper - [Dragon's Paradise Lost: Palaeobiogeography, Evolution and Extinction of the Largest-Ever Terrestrial Lizards](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26856417_Dragon%27s_Paradise_Lost_Palaeobiogeography_Evolution_and_Extinction_of_the_Largest-Ever_Terrestrial_Lizards_Varanidae "www.researchgate.net") - suggests that numerous species radiated from the Komodo dragon which were found outside its current range. They are:

*   Javan dragons - an unnamed extinct species found in Java
*   Timorean dragons - also unnamed, found in Timor, and significantly larger than modern Komodos
*   Varanus sivalensis \- also known as the Siwalik dragon, a Komodo-sized lizard found in India which could have hunted prehistoric giraffes.

In short, Komodo dragons and their descendants certainly did live outside Indonesia. Why don’t they anymore? We don’t know, as the prehistory of this species is still shrouded in mystery.
