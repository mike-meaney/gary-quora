That's a hard question to answer. You see, there's often a huge gap between the time a fossil species is found, and when it is scientifically described. You could use “discovered” to refer to either of those events, and it is in the latter one that the species usually comes to public attention.

For example, take Simbakubwa, the “new” hyaenodont from Kenya. You may know that it was found in a museum drawer, filed away as a hyena. It could've been there for who knows how long, easily 20 years or more. Furthermore, the paper was written a year ago, it was only published recently.

However, if you mean discovered as in scientifically described and then published, my answer would be Gobihadros, a basal hadrosaur from Mongolia. At the time of me writing this answer, the paper describing it was released a week ago. Here it is: [https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0208480](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0208480 "journals.plos.org")
