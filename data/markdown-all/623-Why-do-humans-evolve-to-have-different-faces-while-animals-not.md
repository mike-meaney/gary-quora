Golden retrievers, I find, are extroardinarily variable in terms of appearance, even when they are siblings.

All of the above dogs are distinguishable from all the others. It would seem that some animals are genetically more likely to look different than others. I myself think that sociality and recognition plays a part in it, although in the case of the retriever, itâ€™s probably either a result or side-effect of selective breeding.
