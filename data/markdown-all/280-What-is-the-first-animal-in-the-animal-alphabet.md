I thought about this for a while, and concluded that it must be Aaadonta angaurana. This is a critically endangered species of land snail. The genus Aaadonta is the only animal taxon which has a triple “A” at the start, and of these A. angaurana is the only one whose specific epithet begins with A too.

Excluding the other species of Aaadonta, some of the runner-ups include:

*   Aacanthocnema burckhardti, a type of bug known as a jumping plant louse. I couldn’t find any photos available online. There are also several other species in the Aacanthocnema, of which this one is alphabetically first.
*   Aades bicultratus, a pretty cool-looking, camouflaged species of beetle. Again, there are a bunch more species in the genus Aades.

However, if you’re only looking for common (English) names, the winner would be the aardvark. I’m sure you’ve heard of it, it’s a somewhat pig-like mammal, related to tenrecs and elephant shrews, which eats termites.

Close behind in second place is Aaron’s skipper, a moth:

If we cast our net a little wider and include organisms which are not animals, the holder of the title is going to be some kind of plant. If scientific names are allowed, it’s Aa achalensis, an orchid which lives at high altitude in the snowy Andes.

As a bonus, the last animal in the alphabet (to my knowledge) is Zyzzyzus warreni, also known as the tubular sponge hydroid. This cnidarian is an ocean-dwelling invertebrate shaped a bit like a daisy.

And that’s been my tour of animal alphabetical extremes. Thanks for reading!
