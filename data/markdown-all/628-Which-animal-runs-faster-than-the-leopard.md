Many large mammals.

Wikipedia has a list of fast mammals, though it is of course greatly incomplete:

Leopards would be just below spotted hyenas at a maximum of 58 km/h. Like I said, the list is incomplete; an impala, for example, can sprint at 80 km/h but is nowhere to be seen on the list. I’d say most antelope could probably outpace a leopard in the short run.

That list there is just the one for mammals. However, the only animals I’m aware of which would be fast enough to get on the list when running (not flying) are the ostrich (96.6 km/h) and the rhea (64.4 km/h).
