Well, kind of. It depends how loosely you mean that. This is the video of the seal:

Technically, it didn’t actually learn off the song, it was just trained to repeat sequences of notes using vocal mimicry. Also, for obvious reasons, it only mimicked a bar of the main theme rather than the whole thing.

Nevertheless, this is definitely indicative of intelligence. While it didn’t learn the song per se, the seal did display capacity for learning. Perhaps the most famous vocal mimics are African grey parrots, one of which was also trained to sing the Star Wars theme;

And African grey parrots are thought to be one of the most intelligent birds in the world. However, this experiment on the grey seals was not the first known instance of vocal mimicry in seals - there was a celebrated harbour seal called Hoover who learnt, by himself, to copy his owner’s speech:

Best of all, he said thing in a gruff New England accent. His favourite phrases included “Hey get outta here” and “Hello there”.
