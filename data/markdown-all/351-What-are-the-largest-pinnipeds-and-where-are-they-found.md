The largest pinniped, as well as the largest carnivoran, and the third-largest (on average) non-cetacean mammal in the world is the Southern elephant seal, Mirounga leonina.

An average male Southern elephant seal weighs over 3 tons, which is heavier than a typical African forest elephant. The largest one shot weighed about 5 tons, equivalent to an African bush elephant, and was nearly 7 metres long. Females, meanwhile, are much smaller - around 4 times smaller than males.

They are found on the shores of Antarctica, throughout subantarctic waters, and also on very southerly South American islands like South Georgia and the Falklands.

These are the rest of the top five largest pinnipeds, in order of size;

*   Northern elephant seal, eastern Pacific - maximum 3.7 tons

This list doesn’t include extinct species of pinniped - if it did, the one second to southern elephant seals would be Pontolis magnus, an extinct Miocene walrus which potentially grew up to 4 tons in weight.
