They do, because birds are dinosaurs bla bla bla, and in my opinion the scariest ones are potoos. Members of this family, found in Central and South America, camouflage themselves to look like woody branches. Their heads are large, their beaks broad and short, and their eyes huge.

As if that wasn’t enough, they can dilate their pupils so much that their entire eye turns black (pictured), making them look like the sleestaks from Land of the Lost. Oh, and they sound like demonic creatures from Hell: [Great Potoo (Nyctibius grandis) Call](https://www.hbw.com/ibc/sound/great-potoo-nyctibius-grandis/call "www.hbw.com")

Some other contenders for the scariest-looking modern dinosaurs are shoebill storks - found in East Africa, their jaws are so powerful that they’ve been known to decapitate crocodiles;

And marabou storks. Living in much of sub-Saharan Africa, these hideous avians will eat anything - rotting meat, feces, scraps of metal, shoes, other birds, you name it. They frequent landfill sites and have been known to attack humans.

However, I know that you were referring to non-avian dinosaurs. The problem is that, after 65 million years, it’s impossible to predict what they would look like. I’m sure there would be scary ones, but what they would be I cannot tell.
