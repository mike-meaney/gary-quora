Of the extinct subspecies of spotted hyena, the cave hyena, Crocuta crocuta spelaea, is undoubtedly the most famous. However, there is another - Crocuta crocuta ultima, occasionally assigned its own species.

(As far as I know, no artistic reconstructions of it exist.)

Fossils of these spotted hyenas have been found in Russia, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos. There are also apparently Crocuta crocuta fossils from Java which haven’t been assigned a subspecies, but they’re probably C. c. ultima given their location.

Interestingly, one of the sites these hyenas have been found in - the Penghu Islands - is the homeplace of a dubious hominin species, Homo tsaichangensis, possibly just a H. sapiens or a Denisovan. Whoever they were, they would have doubtless encountered Crocuta crocuta ultima.

In other parts of East Asia, it would have had other interesting contemporaries - and potential competitors. In Cambodia, fossils of Crocuta crocuta ultima have been found alongside those of leopards, and in much of its range it might have encountered the enormous hyena Pachycrocuta brevirostris.

In fact, it’s thought that the spotted hyenas outcompeted this giant hyena, being more intelligent and mobile.

Speaking of intelligence, evidence actually suggests that Crocuta crocuta ultima had a larger brain than modern spotted hyenas. [This paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618215009969 "www.sciencedirect.com") looked at the brain sizes of various hyaenids, and as you can see, C. c. ultima (A) is definitely the biggest.

By the way, the rest are in order - cave hyena, cave hyena, modern spotted hyena, striped hyena, and brown hyena. Now, relative brain size isn’t everything when it comes to intelligence, but it is at least somewhat indicative of cognitive abilities.

Anyways, I think this animal deserves a lot more attention than it gets - my guess is that only a handful of people on this whole site have heard of it before now. It’s got plenty of cool factor, yet not one paleoartist has reconstructed it.
