You mean other than cetaceans and primates?

Well, most mammals - with the exception of primates - have dichromatic vision\*, which is better for seeing in low light (mammals were, in their early days, mainly nocturnal), but not so good for colour vision. Thus, there’s not much reason to evolve bright colours like blue when your prospective mates can’t even see it.

Birds, on the other hand, have excellent colour vision, which is why they’re usually much more flamboyant and vividly hued than us mammals. Primates evolved trichromatic vision either to differentiate between types of fruit or to detect flushing - one of the many subtle social cues of primate societies.

\*Reindeer actually have tetrachromatic vision, which makes things like urine, lichen and fur stand out black against the white snow, due to the fact that the low Arctic sun’s blue and UV rays are the only ones to reach objects.
