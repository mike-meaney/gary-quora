## Why do people think scientific proof for human evolution would disprove the existence of God?

Various creationists purport that the theory of evolution and the existence of god are mutually exclusive, although there is absolutely no reason to think that. Between 94.5 and 99.5% of scientists support evolution, and about half of all scientists are religious.

Most of these people believe that the Genesis being disproven (which it has been, just not in their eyes) would conflict with their religion because it meant that a part of their Bible was not true.

I guess God died when we proved that there was no such thing as the Firmament, in that case…

To me, it seems much more reasonable that God would design a self-correcting process by which new and functional life forms could come about under their own steam, one which he could influence if need be, rather than specially designing a billion species or more (including extinct ones), each with an unfathomably complex set of machinery inside it.

(I’m not religious, I’m agnostic, by the way)
