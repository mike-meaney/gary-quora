The African elephant, Loxodonta africanus.

An African elephant in Ethiopia

Ethiopia is a landlocked country, so it doesn’t have any waters where whales would be, so the biggest animal is gonna be a terrestrial one. And the African elephant, the biggest land animal in the world, does in fact inhabit Ethiopia.

The range of the African elephant. Ethiopia is the country to the right of those orange things.

The elephant’s range in Ethiopia is very small and very broken. The country has a bad history of poaching and much of its elephants have been killed. Fortunately, elephants exist in 3 national parks:

1.  Omo National Park
2.  Nechisar National Park
3.  Babile Elephant Sanctuary

The biggest elephant population in Ethiopia is in the last one, Babile Elephant sanctuary, and there are a few in the other ones too.

That’s really all I have to say on the subject, thanks for asking!
