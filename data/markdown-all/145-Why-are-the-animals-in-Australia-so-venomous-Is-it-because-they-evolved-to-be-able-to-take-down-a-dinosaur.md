## Why are the animals in Australia so venomous? Is it because they evolved to be able to take down a dinosaur?

No, unfortunately. There are 66 species of venomous animals in Australia. From a global perspective, this is a lot, but there are countries like Mexico and Brazil which have around 80. This is a map which represents this data for all the world’s nations:

Now, here’s a map of biodiversity by country:

Notice a correlation? A country with a very high diversity of species will probably have a high diversity of venomous species too, because the latter is a subset of the former.

But this is just moving the goalposts. Why is Australia so biodiverse? For one thing, a large portion of the country experiences a tropical climate, and tropical regions typically have high biodiversity, because there’s more food, because there’s more sunlight. Additionally, Australia is enormous, so there’s plenty of room for species.

Because Australia is really the only Western country in the tropics, its venomous wildlife gets a lot of press in the rest of the West. However, compared to countries of similar latitude, it’s nothing too special.
