## Is there any observable evidence for Darwinian evolution from kind to another that can be tested by scientific method and fossils, and what is it?

Yes. Absolutely, there is an overwhelming amount of evidence for evolution, far more than there is for the Higgs boson or string theory, which you Creationists all accept.

Consider the following:

1.  Evolution, and indeed speciation has been directly observed, as in Italian wall lizards, the Big Bird lineage, and numerous other populations of organisms.
2.  Radiometric dating tells us that the Earth is 4 and a half billion years old. Saying that God could have changed the radioactive decay rate of uranium is an unacceptable counter-argument and has zero evidence in support of it.
3.  Fossils of permineralized microorganisms have been dated to be 3.465 billion years old, and we don’t know how long life could have been around before that.
4.  If evolution as directly observed (microevolution, as you Creationists would say) is true, and there were organisms 3.465 billion years ago, then life must have been evolving all this time. With that much time, “microevolution” is bound to pile up to “macroevolution”.

So, now that we have come to that hypothesis, we should check another source to see if it’s consistent (something “Creation scientists” almost never do). I could pick from a smorgasbord of other evidences like ontogenesis, atavisms, vestiges, phylogenetics and comparative anatomy, but I’m going to go with your example - the fossil record.

Contrary to what Creationists often infuriatingly say, we have an abundance of transitional fossils, but even still, let me discuss the unlikelihood of fossilization in the first place. Imagine an animal dies somewhere in the wild.

What, do you think, are the chances that it will not be eaten by scavengers, detritivores and decomposers? And then what are the chances that it will come across the perfect conditions for fossilization which almost never occur? And then what are the chances of it surviving, beautifully preserved, for millions of years, hundreds of millions of years in some cases. Then, what are the chances of it doing so in a place such that during the Holocene, its fossil is located somewhere accessible where excavation is feasible? Lastly, the chances of us discovering that fossil aren't all that big either.

In any case, even against these overwhelming odds, we still have an impressive portion of the evolutionary history of life with hard parts. Take the history of man, for example, starting at the root of Chordata. We can trace from Pikaia to Haikouicthys and then onto ostracoderms, through placoderm-like Gnathostomes to Chondricthyes to lobe-finned fish such as coelocanths. Then we go from there to Eusthenopteron to Pandericthys to Tiktaalik to Icthyostega to Acanthostega to Hyernpeton to primitive amniotes like Hylonomus.

Henceforth, we go from Pelycosaurs (early Synapsids) to therapsids like Phtinidosuchus to cynodonts to shrew-like generalists, which looked about the same for a really long time and then evolved into arboreal mammals like Purgatorius to prosimians to Old World monkeys to early hominids to Australopithecines to Homo erectus and finally to ourselves.

There you have it; the complete evolutionary history of mankind as told by the fossil record. Beyond Pikaia, conodonts and the like, animals have no hard parts so are exponentially less likely to fossilize, but we still have a rough idea of what happened. Analogues to things like endosymbiosis and basic multicellularity have been directly observed in microbes, and abiogenesis (though it has nothing to do with evolution) has a multitude of theories explaining it.

Now, don't go thinking that I've assembled all this under the notion that I will convince you that the theory of evolution is true. I know that, if you are a Creationist, it means you've already shouldered off the myriad evidence presented to you and stuck doggedly to your Bronze Age stories, and that this answer will make no difference. No, I wrote this to educate people about just one facet of the evidence for evolution, because that is what all scientists who debate Creationists seek to do.
