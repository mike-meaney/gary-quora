> What was the thing that started . . . the Archean eon?

From what my cursory research told me, the beginning of the Archean 4 billion years ago is marked by the accumulation of enough [shield](http://geography.name/shield/ "geography.name") rock form continents.

Interestingly enough, the Archean and the preceding Hadean are not different strata - the boundary is purely arbitrary.

> What was the thing that . . . ended the Archean eon?

Again according to my research, the end of the Archean 2.4 billion years ago - and therefore, the beginning of the next eon, the Proterozoic - is when a bunch of changes began to occur, most notably the oxygenation of the atmosphere.

This process was done by cyanobacteria, which are still around today (see photo above), the “inventors” of photosynthesis. As you probably know, the production of oxygen is a byproduct of the photosynthetic process.

> Did life exist?

As far as we know, not right at the start, but quite soon after it. Graphite evidently produced by an organism has been dated to 3.7 billion years ago, and fossils of stromatolites (rocks which result from bacterial colonies). There are also stromatolites still around today.

> What are some of the firsts that happened during this time?

Well, some notable ones include:

*   The first life/bacteria
*   The first continents
*   The first photosynthesic organisms
*   The first Archaeans

> What was the atmosphere like

The Archean atmosphere is not as well understood as that of other periods in Earth's history, but it is thought that there were trace amounts of free oxygen in the air.

There was probably quite a lot of carbon dioxide around too, as volcanic activity was intense during this time. This is why there were no ice ages during the Archean.

Perhaps the earliest continent was the Archean supercontinent of Ur, literally meaning “original”. Later on, another continent called Arctica popped up.

Another contender for the title is the mysterious Vaalbara, rocks from which have been found as far apart as South Africa and Australia.

Right, so those seem to be the best answers I can give your questions on this interesting episode in Earth's history.
