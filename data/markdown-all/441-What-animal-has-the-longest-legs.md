I assume we’re talking about length in relation to body size here. In that case, the longest-legged vertebrate, as far as I know, is the black-winged stilt, Himantopus himantopus. Fun fact - it’s actually the type species for all stilts. In any case, I can’t find a figure for its exact leg length, but I have read that (for its size) it surpasses all other birds.

However, arthropods unsurprisingly seize the title when talking about all the animal kingdom. I’ve thought about it for a while, and concluded that the Opiliones, or harvestmen, would surely have the longest legs. While some species have fairly standard limbs, others have proportionately huge ones.

In the sea, the winner would definitely be some kind of pycnogonid. Pycnogonids, commonly (albeit misnomerically) known as sea spiders, have bodies so slight that their digestive system has to extend into the huge legs too. In fact, they don’t even have a respiratory system - gases simply diffuse through their stick-thin forms.

Another irrelevant, but interesting, fact - in the Devonian period, there was a genus of pycnogonid called Paleoisopus which had huge, lobster-like forelimbs. Unfortunately I can’t find any reconstructions online.
