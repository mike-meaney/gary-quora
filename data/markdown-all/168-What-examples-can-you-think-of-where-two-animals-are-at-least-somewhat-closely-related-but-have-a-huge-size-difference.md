## What examples can you think of where two animals are at least somewhat closely related but have a huge size difference?

Over 50,000 years ago, a massive beast roamed the forests and plains of India, China and Japan. Its name was the Asian straight-tusked elephant, or Palaeoloxodon namadicus, and it may well have been the largest land mammal ever to walk the Earth.

P. namadicus has been estimated to have stood more than five metres tall at the shoulder, comparable to the height of a giraffe at the head. Even more impressive, its estimated weight is an earth-shaking 22,000 kilograms, or over four times the size of an average African savannah elephant bull. These figures are extrapolated from a partial thigh bone.

Aside from its gigantic size, there would have been a couple ways you could distinguish this kind of elephant from a modern variety. Of course, the tusks curve a lot less than related species, hence the name “straight-tusked elephant”.

Additionally, they had a very noticeable domed crest on their skull, which overhung the forehead, and looked almost like an old-fashioned powdered wig. This was actually used as an anchor point for massive neck musculature, which was required to keep the huge head upright.

A very close cousin of the Asian straight-tusked elephant was the Cyprus dwarf elephant, scientifically termed Palaeoloxodon cypriotes. Its name is a pretty good summary of exactly what it was; it lived on the island of Cyprus up until about 13,000 years ago, and it was the smallest known proboscidean ever to live.

Palaeoloxodon cypriotes weighed around 200 kilograms, and stood less than five feet tall at the shoulder! In other words, its relative P. namadicus was around 110 times larger than it. As I’m sure many of you can guess, it was an extreme case of insular dwarfism: an animal which evolved to be smaller due to living on a small island.

Although the Cyprus species was the smallest of them all, it’s quite surprising how many times pintsize pachyderms have evolved independently. During the last Ice Age, they could be found in Sicily, Sardinia, Malta, Crete, Cyprus, Java, Flores, Sulawesi, Japan, the Channel Islands, various isles off Siberia and Alaska, and more.

We think of elephants as giant creatures, and rightly so, but back in the day there were a lot of little ones too! The origins of the Mediterranean dwarf elephants are especially interesting. In the Miocene epoch, there was an event known as the Messinian Salinity Crisis.

The Strait of Gibraltar became closed off, and as a result, most of the inland sea dried up, leaving a vast saltpan where water once was. Eventually, large animals such as elephants colonized this new plain, and walked across to the small islands in the sea. Then, around 5 million years ago, the Mediterranean basin was filled back up by the so-called Zanclean Flood.

The elephants (and many other animals, including hippos, deer, bison, monkeys and dholes) suddenly found themselves with much less real estate than they previously had, so they gradually became much smaller to adapt to the lack of space and resources. Hence all the pygmy wildlife…

So, to answer your question in short, I nominate Palaeoloxodon namadicus and Palaeoloxodon cypriotes. The largest known proboscidean of all time and the smallest known proboscidean of all time, both in the same genus. Thank you very much for reading, have a great day.
