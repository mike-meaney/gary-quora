## Is the fossa as intelligent as regular, social mongooses?

No, probably not.

Now, not many people know that fossas are capable of co-operative hunting. From Gottingen’s 2012 paper Social Organization and Mating System of the Fossa;

> We report the first detailed observation of cooperative hunting for a solitary species, the Malagasy fosa (Cryptoprocta ferox). We observed a 45‐ minutes‐hunt of a 3‐kg arboreal primate by three male fosas with changing roles among the hunters and subsequent share of prey

(He spells fossa weirdly, just ignore that.)

As an interesting side note, the paper hypothesizes that this pack hunting behaviour may have been an adaptation for hunting extinct “giant lemurs” such as the gorilla-sized Archaeoindris, which was hunted to extinction sometime since 350 BC.

Now that’s all great, but compare that to herpestids, the most intelligent of which (the suricate or meerkat) lives permanently in groups of dozens, have been demonstrated to have advanced problem-solving and behavioural learning skills, and may even be among the world’s most intellectual animals.

As Ken says, hunting intelligent social primates does indeed require some brains (Unless you do it in a blunt, crocodilian manner), as does maintaining balance in the trees. As mammals go, fossas are smart, for sure, but definitely can't match the very high intelligence of mongooses.
