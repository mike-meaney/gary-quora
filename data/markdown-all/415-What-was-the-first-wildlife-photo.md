The earliest known photo of a living animal is probably an untitled one of a cow in Rome, taken in 1842. From this year, there’s also Desert Near Alexandria, which shows a dromedary camel. However, both the cow and the camel are domesticated animals, so they don’t qualify as wildlife.

With that in mind, I think the first wildlife photo we know of today is Man with Elephant, captured by Thomas Easterly. It’s dated to circa 1850, making it more than 170 years old. The Asian elephant pictured was probably in the St. Louis Zoo, so it’s arguably not wildlife, but it is at least a wild species of animal.

There are other contenders, however. This is a photo of an eagle which is also estimated to have been taken around 1850; neither its title nor its photographer are known. It appears that the bird turned its head as the picture was taken, hence the blurriness at the face.

One which we know the date of for sure is this capture of a hippo in London Zoo, from 1852. The animal’s name was Obaysch, and at the time he was world-famous, as he was the first hippopotamus to set foot in Europe since the days of the Roman Empire. He was found in Egypt as a baby and shipped over to England.

The man who took the photo, Juan Carlos María Isidros de Borbón, has a bizarre history himself. He was a hobbyist photographer, but claimed to be the rightful King of Spain, and later the rightful King of France. Then, after that, he was offered the throne of the Empire of Mexico, but declined.

So, all three of these animals were probably in captivity, but they weren’t of a domesticated breed. The hippo, and likely the elephant too, were certainly wild at some point, before being captured. To my knowledge, these are the closest things we have to “wildlife photography” from this era.
