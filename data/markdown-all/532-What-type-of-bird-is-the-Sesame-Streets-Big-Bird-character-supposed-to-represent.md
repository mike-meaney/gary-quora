The large size, flightlessness and elongated neck of Big Bird might lead one to hypothesize that he is some kind of paleognath or ratite, like an ostrich.

However, the long beak is not in step with typical ratite traits. It is more evocative of the family of Ardeidae - the herons, egrets and bitterns.

But I think we can do better. Herons and their kin have very S-shaped necks, and BB's neck is quite straight. Yes, ardeids can extend their necks to be straight, but there are matching taxa with less curvy ones.

Enter the gruids, better known as cranes - these resemble herons in many respects, but have necks which are straighter.

In the Pleistocene epoch, there was even a crane which was flightless, like the character. Grus cubensis shared the Caribbean of its time with giant cursorial eagles, flightless owls, huge caracaras and (possibly quadrupedal) ibises with clubs on their wings.

So, in summary, I think Big Bird is likely a giant, flightless crane with yellow plumage.
