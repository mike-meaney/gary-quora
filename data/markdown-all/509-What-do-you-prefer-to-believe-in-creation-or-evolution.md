I think that this so-called “controversy” is an archaic debate that should not have persisted into the 21st century, just like belief in a Flat Earth or geocentrism.

Every Creationist argument, both against evolution and in favor of Creation, has been debunked, usually decades ago. And, unlike evolutionary biologists which are constantly making progress and improving understanding, Creationists just regurgitate the same flawed arguments… again, and again, and again.

We know that evolution happens and we’ve directly observed macroevolutionary transitions, we have a relatively cohesive lineup of transitional fossils from protochordates to humans, we can draw up phylogenetic trees from genetic data which reflect evolutionary trends, we find dozens of vestiges and atavisms and viral genes inside living organisms, we see revelatory biogeographical patterns, and most importantly, we have an actual theory, something which Creationism lacks.

What do they have? Well, there’s a handful of arguments against evolution which either misrepresent the theory (E.g. “dogs don’t give birth to non-dogs”), are based on a misunderstanding of facts (E.g. “thermodynamics disproves evolution”) or are not actual evidences and just make evolution sound less appealing (E.g. “do you really want your children to think they’re just animals?”).

Anyway, they seem to think that that evidence against evolution, of which there is none, is evidence for Biblical Creation - the false dichotomy. They still can’t say why the Bible is a historical record and not the hundreds of thousands of creation myths from other religions.

Essentially, how there is still a “controversy” about evolution is beyond me. I would gladly like to hear a new, unheard Creationist argument, but unfortunately no such things exist - they all repeat the same old stuff, and always ignore the age-old disproval of that stuff.
