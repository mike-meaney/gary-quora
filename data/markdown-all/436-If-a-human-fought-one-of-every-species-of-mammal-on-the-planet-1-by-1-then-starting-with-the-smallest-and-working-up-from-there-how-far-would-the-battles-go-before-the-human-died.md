## If a human fought one of every species of mammal on the planet 1 by 1, then starting with the smallest and working up from there, how far would the battles go before the human died?

That’s actually a pretty cool question. First of all, I’ll have to make some assumptions. One, the human is a physically capable adult. Two, he has no weapons or protective gear, since that’s usually how these questions go. Three, fear and stuff will not be taken into account.

According to the most recent estimates, there are 5,416 extant species of mammal. Now, lucky for our plucky fighter, 70% of these species belong to relatively unformidable groups; the rodents, bats, and soricomorphs. They’re also mainly small creatures, so he’ll be facing a lot of them first.

First of all, let’s discuss the 2,277 species of rodents, which will make up about 40% of the species the human will face.

Most of these rodents are small and feeble enough for him to simply squash them, twist their heads off or something like that. However, there are a few which might cause him problems:

*   Porcupines, both of the Old and New World variety. Their detachable quills are potentially very dangerous and have been known to kill big cats and dogs. Without medical attention, a human would be in serious danger.
*   Beavers, whose extremely sharp incisor teeth have been known to kill humans on one occasion. A North American beaver bit a 60-year-old man in his leg and he later died.
*   Capybaras. There are no recorded deaths from these, but they’re big and toothy enough to kill a man if they were attacked. Obviously, no real person has been heartless enough to attack a capybara.

There are other spiny rodents, like spiny mice, but their spines are too small to do any real damage, and they could simply be crushed underfoot. In any case, the three animals above are among the larger rodents, so they won’t be issues at first. Instead, it’s time to move on to bats.

There are over 1,200 species of bat, and in my opinion, none of them could realistically kill a human. Vampire bats can give you rabies, but that takes at least 10 days to develop, and by then you’d have been mauled for sure. That being said, some megabats - despite being fruit-eaters - have impressive teeth:

They could draw blood, yes, and maybe even mangle a finger, but they wouldn’t be anything fatal. The same can be said of Soricomorphs, comprising the shrews, moles and solenodons.

Actually, the first species our fighter will face - the Etruscan shrew - belongs to this group. The largest Soricomorph, the Cuban solenodon (pictured above) weighs only a kilogram, and could easily be defeated by a grown human. So, as said, all of the species in this group would lose their battles.

So, we’ve only just crossed the few-kilograms mark and the human has defeated the majority of mammal species on the planet. Before reaching the 10 kg mark, the human fights, and emerges victorious against:

*   Primates such as tarsiers, small monkeys and small lemurs
*   More Eulipotyphlans like hedgehogs and gymnures
*   All lagomorphs; so that’s pikas, hares and rabbits
*   Many small carnivorans; civets, genets, mongoose, weasels, red pandas, skunks and much more.
*   Most marsupials and all monotremes

Perhaps by now he’d have been injured by foxes, ferrets and raccoons. He could be covered in scratches by now. Alas, the surprisingly insensitive man would have slain hundreds more opponents - and he’s nearly there.

However, this is where things get interesting. Some of the dangerous rodents we mentioned enter the arena one by one - many porcupines, and beavers too. I’d say the fighter could manage the beavers, but the porcupines would be a challenge. He would survive to fight another day, but he could be seriously injured.

And there’s worse to come. Tasmanian devils, wolverines, ratels, coyotes, lynxes, mountain lions, wild pigs, small-medium antelope, cheetahs… you’d be extremely lucky to make it past this slew of 10–20 kg mammals. After that, things would only get worse.

So, in conclusion, I’d say that this human could defeat most mammals, but once they started approaching about 10 kilograms in weight he’d abruptly die sometime soon.
