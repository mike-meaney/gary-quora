The orca (Orcinus orca)

Also known as killer whales, sea wolves, grampuses and blackfish, they are the largest of the dolphins. Their name, killer whale, has long confused many a person, but the group of “whales” is what zoologists call a “polyphyletic group”.

The first and more commonly used form of taxonomy was Linnaean taxanomy, devised by Carl Linnaeus, was in use long before anyone knew about evolution. Later, another method of taxonomy was developed that was based on genetics and ancestry, called cladistics. This is more accurate, and revealed that “whales” comprised members from two separate groups (Baleen whales and toothed whales), and had no common ancestor.

So, orcas are dolphins, but how big are they exactly? The largest ever killer whale recorded, a male, was 9.8 metres long and weighed 10 tonnes. That’s about as heavy as 10 small cars.

There are about 10 “ecotypes” of killer whale, that inhabit different parts of the world. The two most well known are:

*   Resident killer whales - fish-eaters, they are safer to humans and can be swum with in places like Norway
*   Transient killer whales - they eat marine mammals, from seals to dolphins to full-grown whales. Far more dangerous, these are the larger than Residents.

Orcas are also remarkably intelligent. Individuals will develop their own hunting strategies which they pass on as traditions, they have a language with dialects and accents, and some of their hunting techniques are ingenius. They stun fish by slapping their tails against the water, beach themselves to catch sea lions, flip over icebergs to get at seals. They’ve even learnt to roll great white sharks over, which puts them in a trance.
