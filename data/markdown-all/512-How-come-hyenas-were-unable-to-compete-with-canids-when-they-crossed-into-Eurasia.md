I can only answer for one species, or rather subspecies, the cave hyena Crocuta crocuta spelaea.

The date of their extinction corroborates directly with an apparent shrinkage of grassland habitats and expansion of mixed woodlands. Wolves, and indeed humans, are better at hunting in varied-biome habitats, and thus outcompeted the cave hyena.

However, for the other hyaenid species of Eurasia, I do not know the answer but would love to find out. I at least know that the giant hyena, Pachycrocuta, may have gone extinct after the extinction of sabertooth cats.
