## Why shouldn't we draw dinosaurs as being too fat or too skinny? What's wrong with drawing fat dinosaurs and skinny dinosaurs?

The “lumpy” depictions of dinosaurs are usually from a time when our undertsanding of them was quite poor, and we viewed them as sluggish dullards. We now know that many of them were active, warm-blooded animals that can run fast, jump far and travel many miles.

Animals in the wild very rarely have overly fat or overly skinny individuals, because they die out quickly in the wild. There are obese and really skinny humans because a) our lives aren’t as active and b) we care for the “unfit”.

What paleoartists too often do is look at the skeleton, add the minimum amount of tissue onto it and then draw it.

Imagine that in hundreds of millions of years, a new intelligent civilization evolved from Earth. If their paleoartists were like some of ours, their reconstructions of modern-day animals could be horribly off.

C.M Kosemen drew a number of illustrations of these “shrink-wrapped” animals, shown here.

They might draw this, he says:
