You’ve received many answers, but I don’t see why you shouldn’t get one more.

First of all, we must establish the true meaning of “deep time”. Young Earth Creationists believe that the Earth is 6,000 years old, while other people say that it is 4.5 billion years old.

We can tell this by looking at the radioactive decay of uranium. You see, the uranium atoms in rock decay - at a consistent rate - into lead atoms, and by determining the rate of uranium decay, we can date very old objects by looking at how much of their uranium has become lead.

Because we know this rate, we assume that the rate has never changed since the beginning of the universe, since the same natural laws that apply today should apply in the past as well. In contrast, (some) Creationists believe that there is a Creator, and he or she can change these natural laws, which would make observations about the present the only reliable way to do science, as the past obeyed different laws.

There are other ways of telling how viable the 6000 Ka date is. For example; we can see stars that are more than 6,000 lightyears away, and there are living trees that are older than 6,000 - bristlecone pines.

Now, if you agree with this argument, we can establish that the Earth is at least 4.374 billion years old and life originated 3.6 billion years ago, and thus know what kind of timescale we’re talking about.

The next thing we shall look at is genetics. Anyone can observe that most people have slightly similar traits - in personality, appearance, intellect etc. - to their biological parents. However, they are obviously not exactly the same as their parents, so there is room for variation.

All people differ considerably from their parents, but others differ hugely (E.g. albinos, other “aberrant” conditions), because tiny changes during the stage of embryological development cause the organism to be different when they are born. The bigger and earlier the change, the more different the offspring.

Some differing traits are non-beneficial (E.g. mental disabilities) for animals in the wild, while others are beneficial (E.g. strength). Whether or not they are beneficial is determined by two processes - environmental selection and sexual selection.The former applies to traits which will change an organism’s chances of surviving in the wild, while the latter applies to those that will change how attractive they are to potential mates. If an organism is selected against environmentally, they are poor at surviving up to the point where they can mate. If an organism is selected against sexually, they are less likely to be chosen as a mate on the basis that the opposite sex will observe in them characteristics they do not want their offspring to inherit.

With those two phenomena in mind, which make perfect sense when you think about them, consider this quote from Charles Darwin:

> Can we doubt, that individuals having any advantage, however slight, over others, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating their kind?

As he has put so wonderfully here, it seems obvious that better survivors and better mate-impressors are more likely to produce offspring.

But how could whales, tigers and people have evolved from a nucleus-less single-celled organism that lived in primordial tide pools. Once again we must remember the vastness of deep time. 4.6 billion years is such a long time that it is quite taxing for the human brain to even imagine such a vast thing.

Bill Nye has used the metaphor of a walk from San Diego to Boston to display how long four and a half billion years is. I can’t explain it in as much length and detail as he did, but think about this: if every meter represented a million years, with Earth consolidating at San Diego and you reading this answer at Boston, then human history would begin 50 centimeters before you reached your destination.

With that immense amount of time to pass on genes, the amount of derivation from the universal common ancestor seems quite plausible.

* * *

But these organisms are not so derived that they do not share common features. By comparing the anatomy of various creatures, you can see many striking similarities between what you’d think were vastly different organs.

These are the forelimbs of 4 mammals; a human, a domestic cat, a whale, and a fruit bat. All of their forelimbs contain the same bones, but they have been shaped and morphed in a way better suited to their lifestyle. This is the common ancestor of all four of those organisms, including us:

There he is. Your 54 millionth great grandparent. And he had phalanges, metacarpals, carpals, radii, ulna and a humerus too. One lineage of these guys’ descendants took to living in trees, then parachuting from them with lateral membranes of skin, and then finally flight. Another lineage of his descendants may have gained longer legs, carnassial teeth and large canines; producing a civet-like form and then finally the domestic beast we know today. One group branched off this line, gaining hooves and a long snout, then taking to the waters to become whales.

And finally, one of his descendants started living in trees. That lineage evolved hands to grip the branches, a flat face, then lost its tail, left the trees and started walking on two feet, to become the ocean-polluting, planet-destroying sophont we see every day.

Darwin also has another great quote;

> Man is developed from an ovule, about 125th of an inch in diameter, which differs in no respect from the ovules of other animals.

If this is true, we would expect organisms to diverge more and more as that ovule developed into an embryo and then a child. And indeed, we do. Here is a picture comparing three stages of embryological development in several vertebrate species:

Take the middle stage, for example. Is it hard to think, in any way, of how little modification needs to be made to turn one into the next? Only in the third stage does the spectrum begin to break up.

* * *

So, we have seen that in the developmental stage, all vertebrates are very similar for quite some time. At this point, I could talk about DNA comparison, nested hierarchies of traits, comparative distribution, and the fossil record, but I will not demand your attention any longer; save for a couple of points on scientific protocols and how they tell us to approach the theory of evolution.

Firstly, you should be able to make predictions with all scientific theories, hypotheses. And that scientists did, with the theory of evolution.

Tiktaalik is a tetrapodomorph - an embodiment of the transitional stage between fish and amphibians. And, before it was discovered, paleontologists predicted that an animal just like it would live in a specific type of swamp from the Devonian period. Then they looked in various rock formations known to have once been swamps of that type, and they found Tiktaalik.

Secondly, the only things proven are mathematics and logic. A sensible person does not believe in anything else. So really, I don’t believe in evolution. I just consider it to be the most likely way that life came to be how it is today.

But, as with all theories, scientists are wont to accept the one with the most evidence. And, at the moment, there is no evidence for Creationism, negative evidence for Young Earth Creationism, but an overwhelming amount of evidence for evolution.

* * *

And that’s my answer. To summarize; Given the vast amount of time which has been elapsed since the beginning of life, it is obvious that organisms with successful traits are more likely to pass on their genes. By comparing different species’ anatomy and embryological development, it appears that all organisms are related, which supports the notion that one species can turn into many. Given that it can be used to make predictions and there is so much evidence for it, scientific principles deem it that we should be in favour of the theory of evolution, but nothing is proven.
