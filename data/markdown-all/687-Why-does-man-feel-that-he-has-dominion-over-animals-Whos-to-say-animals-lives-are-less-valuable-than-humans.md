“Why does man feel that he has dominion over animals?”

Arrogance. One of the many, many prices of intelligence.

You see, when intelligence evolves, it comes with a whole package of emotions that are designed to help us survive. And they do - when we’re fighting for our lives in the wilderness.

But when intelligence advances the creatures so far that suddenly, they live sheltered, pampered lives in cities, getting obese and watching TV, then these survival skills are no longer needed.

Yet humans think and operate on a much faster timescale than nature, so these emotions still remain with us today. In fact, all the emotions we experience today are based on our ancestral environment. Kindness comes from the need for co-operation in the wild. Fear comes from the need to avoid damaging the body.

But what about arrogance? Arrogance is also a useful survival tool in a primal environment. It prevents submission, encourages tenacity and, in a way, tells you to “never give up” (Arrogance over your environment causes you to believe you can overcome it).

Pair up arrogance with thousands of years of hunting, eating and domesticating animals, and you get a belief that humans are superior to the animals, merely because we’re dominant in the short-term.

The truth is, that animal lives are no less valuable than ours. Because the thing is, value itself is also a human construct. Yes, 1 tonne of grass is more valuable to a cow than 1 kilogram of grass, but what is the health of the cow’s value to the world? Maybe it is one of a single remaining breeding pair that’s the species’ only hope for survival, but why is the survival of that species valuable to the world and the universe? Even if, for some inconceivable reason, the extinction of that species would mean the end of the universe, its survival is still not valuable.

The world, and the universe, is not a sentient being. If humans die out, it doesn’t care, because it can’t. If Earth is destroyed, it doesn’t care. If the universe ends, it doesn’t and can’t care.

What I’m getting at is that the human’s view of the world is often clouded with our man-made constructs like emotions and feelings and views, all of which the universe lacks. There’s nothing wrong with that, because humans are humans, but when we exercise these constructs - in this case arrogance - over other objects and creatures at their expense, then there’s something wrong.

And the ironic thing here is that in saying that, I am feeling sympathy - another human construct. And that brings me to the main message of this answer: By calling emotions and views things that don’t really exist in nature, I am not saying you shouldn’t have them. I feel emotions, and you feel emotions, but try to feel them in a good way. Species are being wiped out at a higher rate than they have been since the K-T extinction that killed the dinosaurs. And, this is only the second time in history that insects have been affected by a mass extinction - the last time it happened, nearly all life on Earth was destroyed. And all this is because of;

Arrogance. By living in an artificial world, we have managed to escape the unpleasant effects of natural selection, but at the expense of our long-term survival. This is one of the most controversial problems we have to face. If we keep taking care of people with mental and physical conditions which would work against them in the wild, we may suffer major demographic consequences if and when a disaster reverts us to a primal age. I am by no means suggesting we should stop caring for the handicapped, I am merely stating that our technology may work against us as a species, in the far future.

NOTE: I am not a philosopher, I just know that emotions are a thing that are only felt by humans and other animals, which do not really exist in the physical world. I do not view the world with this cold, robotic perspective - I experience and welcome happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust and every other emotion just like you do. The question was “Who’s to say animal lives are less valuable than humans?”, and the answer is no-one. So that is what I answered, and I elaborated to explain.
