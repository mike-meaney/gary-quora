## Why is the Dingo considered important for Australian wildlife conservation despite it being nothing but a non-indigenous, Asian dog breed which went feral after being introduced by sailors?

About 50,000 years ago, Australia was filled to the gunnels with large herbivorous animals such as Diprotodon, Procoptodon, Geneornis and Palorchestes. Though almost all of that large megafauna has been pulverized by human activity, the reality is that some of it is left over - red or grey kangaroos are still pretty damn big.

Big herbivores need big carnivores to be kept in check, and before Aboriginal humans arrived in Australia, there were lots of big carnivores there. Now, however, all the marsupial lions, thylacines, Megalania, Quinkana and Wonambi are gone, so the remainder of the large herbivores have no legitimate natural predators.

However, dingos - regardless of whether or not they evolved in Australia - often hunt large prey - according to Wikipedia, up to a fifth of their diet consists of large animals. So, though they might not be native, they certainly do serve as excellent proxies for at least some of the apex predators from the Pleistocene.
