## Why is a larger area required to support a viable population of carnivores than is needed to support a similar-sized population of herbivores?

Basically, the denser the food source, the denser the consumers.

Think of plants. According to the [10% rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScizkxMlEOM "www.youtube.com"), the biomass of the plants in an ecosystem must be 10 times greater than that of the biomass of the herbivores, so - in a fixed area - the producers will be the most densely spaced of the trophic levels.

Every herbivore needs a much greater mass of plants than its own to survive, at least in the long-term. Therefore, the herbivores cannot be spaced as densely as the plants.

Similarly, carnivores - aside from parasites - need more than one prey item to sustain themselves in the long run, much more in most cases. So, similarly, the density of carnivores cannot be equal to the density of the herbivores, as it will be much less.
