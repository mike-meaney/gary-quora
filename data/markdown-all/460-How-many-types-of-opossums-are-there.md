Opossums are much more diverse than even a typical animal fan would think - in fact, nearly a third of all marsupials are in the opossum group, with 103 different species distributed across North and South America. Here are some of the most interesting types you probably didn’t know about.

*   Chacoan pygmy opossums are the world’s smallest, measuring only 12 centimetres in length. Found only in Argentina, they were never seen for a period of seventy years, until one was spotted in 2004, making them a Lazarus taxon.

*   Lutrine opossums, found mainly in southern Brazil and Argentina, are the world’s most carnivorous opossums, feeding almost exclusively on meat. While not as aquatically skilled as yapoks (see end of answer), they’re able to dive and hunt underwater prey.

*   Patagonian possums, as their names suggest, live in the cold steppes of Patagonia. They have adapted to this chilly climate in numerous ways - they have a short, thick tail for storing fat, and have switched from eating fruit and insects to much larger vertebrates like birds, lizards and mice.

*   Thylophorops is now extinct, having lived in South America during the Pliocene epoch. For an opossum, it was massive - weighing up to 7 kilograms, and was likely a macropredator. One hypothesis is that this killer marsupial ate burrowing animals and then appropriated their burrows for itself.

I’d say the strangest opossum of all, however, is the semi-aquatic yapok. However, I’ve already written on that species (see [here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-little-known-facts-about-marsupials/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")), so I decided to give some other species the spotlight. These aren’t quite as glamorous as those in some of my previous answers, but hopefully you’ll find this interesting nonetheless.
