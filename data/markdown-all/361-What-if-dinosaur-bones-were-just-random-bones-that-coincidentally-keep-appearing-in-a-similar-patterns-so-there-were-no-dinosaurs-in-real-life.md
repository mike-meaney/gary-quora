## What if dinosaur bones were just random bones that coincidentally keep appearing in a similar patterns so there were no dinosaurs in real life?

Would you call this a random bone?

What about this?

The point is that dinosaur bones are simply too unmistakable that there is no other animal that could come close to coming close to mimicking their skeletal appearance.

Also, what about coprolites, and dinosaur skin, and dinosaur tracks, and uniquely shaped eggs? Dinosaurs aren’t just bones these days. There are countless sources that we can cross-check with the bones to prove that they were real.

Besides, a group of animals doesn’t dominate the Earth for over 100 million years without playing a significant part in the evolutionary history of the world? If there were no dinosaurs, where did birds come from?

Now, just supposing that dinosaur bones looked exactly like the bones of modern animals (Which they don’t) and we didn’t have any other sources (Which we do), and birds evolved from, say, mammals (Which they didn’t), then how would these creatures have survived 5 extinctions, including one mass extinction, and now suddenly be being wiped out by the extinction event we’re causing now?

Another thing. If dinosaurs didn’t exist and were in fact extant animals, then why did all the other groups of animals go on evolving and dying out? The average carnivoran genus only lasts about 6 million years.

My point is that since the discovery of Megalosaurus in the 1800s, nobody has ever suggested (Seriously) that these animals are just that of animals alive today. The Ancient Chinese thought that dinosaurs were dragons. The Ancient Greeks thought that mammoths were Cyclopes. However advanced, however educated, no civilization has dismissed the bones of prehistoric animals as simply “random bones”.
