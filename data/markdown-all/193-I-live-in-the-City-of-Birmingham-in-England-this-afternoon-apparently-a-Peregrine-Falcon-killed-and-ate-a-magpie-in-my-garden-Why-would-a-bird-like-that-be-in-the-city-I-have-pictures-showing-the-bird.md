## I live in the City of Birmingham in England, this afternoon apparently a Peregrine Falcon killed and ate a magpie in my garden. Why would a bird like that be in the city? (I have pictures showing the bird)

Despite what one might think, cities are actually the perfect environment for a bird like a peregrine falcon.

Think about it…

*   Tall buildings provide countless lofty spots where a peregrine can build its nest. From up high, birds can simply drop off the edge and glide rather than laboring up into the air, and their eggs/chicks are also safer from ground predators like foxes. Often, falcons nest on balconies!

*   Due to their domestic history, and the abundance of food, feral pigeons are found in abundance in cities on all six of the world’s inhabited continents. Pigeons, as it happens, are among the peregrine falcon’s preferred prey. Besides them you’ve got plenty of other prey like rats, ducks and so on.

*   Concrete absorbs much more heat than most natural surfaces, which leads to a phenomenon known as an urban heat island (this is why cities can be up to 10 degrees C hotter than surrounding countryside). The hot concrete heats up the nearby air, causing it to rise, resulting in an upwards-moving current of air. This makes it much easier for birds to stay airborne.

*   Peregrine falcons, in general, are not at all fussy when it comes to habitat. They’re easily one of the most wide-ranging birds on the planet, tolerating the icy wastes of Greenland, the blistering Kalahari Desert, the dense rainforests of Southeast Asia, and the towering Himalayas. Adapting to cities certainly wouldn’t be much of a stretch.

In this rapidly urbanizing world, it seems like many species worldwide are going to be hit hard. The peregrine falcon, however, is one that I think it’s safe to say we won’t have to worry about.
