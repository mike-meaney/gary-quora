Genetic isolation:

This is when a population of organisms is separated from other populations of its own species long enough for there to be significant genetic differences.

But why?

Well, if you think about how evolution occurs, it’s the result of organisms mating with eachother, and transferring their genes to the next generation. Evolution is a process of improvement, and to evolve good traits, they need to inherit good traits. But how do they do that? The thing is, the better the traits, the better you are at surviving, so the more likely organisms with good traits are to mate.

But when a few leopards migrated up north to the Russian Far East, it was their traits, and only theirs, that were to influence the evolution of the future Amur leopard subspecies.

As you can see on this diagram, the purple population, Amur leopards, is miles away from the nearest other population, which is yellow (North-Chinese leopards). Therefore, the purples couldn’t breed with the yellows, so all the Amur leopards are based on the genes of the first ever leopards in Siberia.
