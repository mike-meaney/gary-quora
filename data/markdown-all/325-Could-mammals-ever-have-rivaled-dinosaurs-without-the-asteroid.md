Well, one thing that must be said is that dinosaur-age mammals (and their close relatives) were much more diverse than we once thought. This, for example, is Castorocauda, a Jurassic mammaliaform which was highly convergent on modern beavers. It had specialized fish-eating teeth and a paddle-like tail.

Fruitafossor was apparently a specialized myrmecophage or termite-eater. Spinolestes had hedgehog-like spines and keratin scutes. The late Jurassic mammal Volaticotherium could even glide like a modern flying squirrel, sugar glider or colugo.

Repenomammus (pictured below) was a stocky, meter-long predator which even preyed on dinosaurs. Ichthyoconodon is the oldest known marine mammal. Didelphodon probably dwelt in rivers and fed on tough prey like molluscs, hence its powerful bite which has been compared to that of a Tasmanian devil.

So, Mesozoic mammaliaforms were diverse, but I concur with the other answerers that another mass extinction would be necessary before they could take the wheel.

As a matter of fact, there is a hypothesis that, even without the asteroid, the dinosaurs wouldâ€™ve been killed off by the Deccan Traps (pictured), a large igneous province which was already releasing sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere by the time the asteroid hit.

So, to summarize; yes, but not without another extinction.
