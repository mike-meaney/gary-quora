To start off with the bad news, lion populations have dropped by about 43 percent since that time, and savanna elephant numbers by over a third in just the past decade or so. In practically every country, elephants are in decline.

Rhinoceros poaching in Africa has skyrocketed, even in well-managed areas such as Kruger National Park in South Africa. This graph only shows the last 7 years but is still sobering.

From 1994–2014, over a million pangolins were illegally poached, most of them in Africa. They are killed because of nonsensical beliefs in Chinese traditional medicine that their scales have healing properties. One ship in 2013 was discovered to have been carrying over 11 tonnes of frozen pangolins.

Worst of all, there have been extinctions. Since 2011, a western black rhinoceros has never set foot on the Earth. Other African animals, such as the northern white rhinoceros (of which there are only two left) and scimitar-horned oryx, are extinct in the wild. Others still, such as the addax, with 3 remaining wild animals, are basically there.

However, it’s not all bad. Greater bamboo lemurs, once thought to be extinct, have been brought back from the brink of extinction and are now on the rise. Overall, black rhino populations have more than doubled since 1995. Poaching threats to Ethiopian wolves have been significantly reduced.

For an inspiring story, look at Mozambique’s Gorongosa National Park. In the ’80s and early ’90s its wildlife was absolutely ravaged by civil war, and the once-great preserve was left a wasteland. Since then, a $10 million effort over 8 years has restored the park, and it is now a thriving ecosystem once again.

All in all, things aren’t looking good for African wildlife. I hate to say it but I really doubt that we’ve seen the continent’s last extinction. However, there have been conservation victories, and, however minor, they are steps foward.
