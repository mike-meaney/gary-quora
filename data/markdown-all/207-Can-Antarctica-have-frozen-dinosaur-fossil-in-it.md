Full question: Can Antarctica have frozen dinosaur fossils in it? With frozen mammoths being discovered every now and then, can there be a possibility that we can hit upon a frozen dinosaur with all its tissues nearly intact?

* * *

Though it would be an amazing discovery to make, it is likely impossible that a non-avian dinosaur could be preserved in permafrost up until the present. During the Mesozoic Era, the world was pretty damn sweltering, with average global temperatures never below 19 degrees Celsius even in its coldest period. As such, there was no permafrost around, at least not where dinosaurs were.

Additionally, and more importantly, the soft tissues of the dinosaur would have to be kept intact for more than 65 million years. There’s a reason why all the frozen remains we have are no more than a few tens of thousands of years old; conditions just don’t stay stable enough to preserve flesh for much longer. That being said, Antarctica was quite an amazing place during the dinosaurs’ reign.

The most ancient evidence of dinosaurs on this continent we know of comes from a fossil site called the Hanson Formation. It’s 194 million years old, and at the time would have been a high, forested mountain range, 4,000 metres above sea level. The climate was cool and temperate, but not frigid - Antarctica was around 1,000 kilometres further north back then.

The most famous polar dinosaur, Cryolophosaurus, roamed the Hanson Formation. Its name translates to “frozen crested lizard”, and it would have been an apex predator in its environment. In fact, it was one of the first large carnivorous dinosaurs ever.

Its namesake was its distinctive curling crest, reminiscent of the quiff of Elvis Presley. In fact, it was nicknamed Elvisaurus when it was first unearthed. Also, due to the rather chilly local temperatures, it surely had a thick coat of feathers, as seen in the speculative artwork above.

Cryolophosaurus lived alongside early pterosaurs, and several primitive relatives of the sauropods. The latter were seemingly the prevalent large herbivores of Antarctica in the Early Jurassic, and probably often fell prey to the theropod. The best-known of these sauropodomorphs is Glacialisaurus, which was over 6 metres long and probably weighed around 600 kg.

The second area in Antarctica where dinosaur remains have been observed is the Antarctic Peninsula. Specifically, I’m talking about various islands off the coast of the Peninsula, such as Snow Hill Island, Ross Island and Seymour Island. Here, we find remnants of a Late Cretaceous ecosystem, 120 million years more recent than our previous dinosaurs.

The top carnivore here, it seems, was a theropod whose name means “powerful warrior”: Imperobator. It was a dromaeosaur (a “raptor”, that is), and at four metres long it was one of the largest dromaeosaurs at that. This is an example of polar gigantism, an observed phenomenon of evolution in which animals tend to be bigger in cold, polar environments.

The main item on Imperobator’s menu would have been small, plant-eating ornithopods. There are several species known from Snow Hill Island; namely Morrosaurus, Biscoveosaurus and Trinisaura. The last of the three is pictured below.

However, there were also much larger herbivores present, perhaps indicating that there were also much larger carnivores yet to be discovered. In 2011, researchers found Antarctic sauropod remains for the first time in history. They seemingly belonged to a lithostrotian titanosaur, implying a very large animal in life with bony scutes armouring its back.

Speaking of armour, the second-most iconic non-bird dinosaur of this continent (after Cryolophosaurus) was Antarctopelta, a find from Ross Island. It was ankylosaur, and a rather small one at that, weighing in at “only” 350 kilograms. It was also the first Antarctic dinosaur ever discovered, dug up in 1986.

So, that about covers every Mesozoic dinosaur from Antarctica we know about as of now. That said, I should also mention that these islands also boast a rich array of aquatic fossil species. The Late Cretaceous oceans of this great southern continent, it would appear, were just as vibrant as the forests and plains.

Back in the day, the shallow surrounding seas were home to ammonites, bivalves, fish (including sharks) and even giant marine reptiles called mosasaurs. One is named Taniwhasaurus, after the taniwha, a sea monster of Maori mythology - its fossils are also known from New Zealand. The other has been identified only from a fossilized egg, and has gained the sobriquet “The Thing”.

In any case, that’s most of what you need to know about the wildlife of Antarctica during the reign of the dinosaurs. While it wasn’t the frozen wasteland it is today back then, it was still further south than most animals would have lived, with dark winters and likely occasional snowfall too. As such, this continent must have been a very unique habitat for the dinosaurs.

Thank you very much for reading, have a great day!
