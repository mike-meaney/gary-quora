## Does Iterative Evolution mean that an extinct dinosaur could return spontaneously through the bloodline of modern animals?

I assume you’ve read, in some shape or form, this article - [This Bird Went Extinct and Then Evolved Into Existence Again](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/vb9bpm/this-bird-went-extinct-and-then-evolved-into-existence-again "www.vice.com"). All of the articles I’ve read on the story explain what actually happened terribly.

They say that this flightless rail went extinct, and then it suddenly “rose from the dead”, popping up again. This, to be honest, is an absolute failure at explaining convergent evolution, also known as parallel or iterative evolution.

Convergent evolution is when similar - sometimes very similar - traits evolve independently of one another, due to similar selective pressures. The new rail is a completely different animal, it just happens to resemble the extinct one. It is genetically closer to its flighted ancestors than to its lookalike.

So, to answer your question, no, at least not in the sense you seem to mean it. What is possible is that a modern animal would, millions of years in the future, evolve into a creature which resembles an extinct dinosaur - indeed, that’s what happened with these rails.
