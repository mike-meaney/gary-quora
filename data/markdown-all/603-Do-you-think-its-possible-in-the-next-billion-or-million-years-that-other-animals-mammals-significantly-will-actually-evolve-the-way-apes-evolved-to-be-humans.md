## Do you think it's possible in the next billion or million years that other animals (mammals, significantly) will actually evolve the way apes evolved to be humans?

1 billion years ago, the only plants were algae and there were no animals. One billion years from now, there will almost certainly be no mammals, and nothing can be predicted.

Orthostasis (human-like posture) will only evolve if it’s beneficial to an organism. If a future animal is reasonably intelligent, arboreal and covered in hair, but its forest habitat turns drier and becomes savannah, then it may evolve along a similar path to hominids - or it may not.

Savannah environments have been central to the way that humans evolved. Open space means that cursorialism is necessary - most cursorial animals walk on four legs, because it increases speed. However, scansorial (climbing animals) usually evolve hands to grip the trees, and you can’t run on hands.

Because of that, bipedalism was the best option for high speed. We don’t have a long tail, so we can’t take up a theropodal posture, like a T. rex or kangaroo. Instead - cursing thousands of human generations with knee and back problems - evolution did something never seen before - bipedalism, but with an upright back - otherwise known as orthostasis.

So, now we have our cursorial primates, but we need more adaptations for the savannah. Unless you’re really freaking fast - like a cheetah - (which, as we discussed, is very hard on two legs) short-distance sprints won’t do you good on a grassland. Instead, you need to become a marathoner. As any long-distance runner will know, you get very hot when you’re running for so long, so you need to be able to shed heat efficiently.

Primates already have the ability to sweat, which means they can cool down on the move, so it was a start. However, being covered in hair didn’t help, so most of the apes’ hair was lost, with the densest concentrations of it being on the head, where most of the body’s heat is lost (Africans don’t always wear their hair long and thick, though, as you probably know).

Hominid intelligence was already pretty good back then, and - especially with tool-making hands - it helped us rise up the food chain, allowing our ancestors to spend less evolutionary time and energy on ecological dominance and more on refining social skills, which leads to more intelligence and more ecological dominance.

If a future animal was to undergo a similar set of events, with similar requirements, they might travel along a roughly hominid-like evolutionary path.
