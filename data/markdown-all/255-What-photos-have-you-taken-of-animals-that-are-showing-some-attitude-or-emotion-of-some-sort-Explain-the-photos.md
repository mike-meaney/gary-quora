A captive lion sidling up to a lioness seductively. The female was uneasy and backed away, rejecting his advances. The atmosphere was tense and I imagine that she was feeling rather uncomfortable.

In a similar vein, a tigress being shadowed by a larger male. There was a barrier between the two, but he was behaving aggressively and she was doubtless fearful. The actual photo quality is rubbish, sorry about that, the camera focused on the foreground.

A litter of feeding piglets being scattered by their formidable father, who was intent on having his share of the feed.

A very wary (captive) grey wolf, who evidently wasn’t too pleased with my presence. He quickly got up and moved away, eyeing me in apparent nervousness.

A strong male chimpanzee giving me a stony glare.

Two cheetahs lying down, one on top of the other. Clearly these were two socially bonded individuals.

This male gorilla in San Diego, trying to get something out of sight in a tree. Standing bipedally and using tools, not only was he demonstrating superb intelligence (and annoying creationists), he was probably a determined individual too.

A meerkat gang’s sentries all stand alert, eyes fixated on something in the sky (probably a suspected bird of prey).

A very-satisfied looking polar bear dining on what else but a head of lettuce. Hypercarnivore? I think not.

A wild American bison bellowing to establish his dominance.

A young American alligator is stepped on by his tank-mate. I won’t claim to know what goes on in the minds of animals, and reptiles aren’t the most expressive of creatures, but I know that I would be at least slightly ticked off by such a thing.

This one is interesting - the middle wolf is in a submissive pose, with the tail tucked in and ears back. Meanwhile the right wolf has its tail held stiffly horizontal, which, if I recall correctly, is a sign of intent to attack. In the end, however, no violence occurred.

The same scene, but a bit earlier - the wolf which is on the left in the first one is in the play bow position, a sign of playfulness. Meanwhile, the right wolf is in a neutral pose.

A terrible-quality photo of two wild male impala squaring up to each other, no doubt feeling aggressive. They later locked horns, but I didn’t get a photo of that.

Another photo from Kenya, also unholy in quality, of a cheetah preparing for a hunt. It crouched in the grass like this for about three minutes, watching a group of Thomson’s gazelle about 200 metres away, and eventually burst out into a sprint. Unfortunately for the cheetah, the hunt was unsuccessful.

A Cape buffalo, apparently male, eyeing me warily just outside the lodge. I was thankful for the electric fence between me and it.

A bull elephant in Amboseli who was evidently… interested in something.

A zebra foal enjoying a wallow in the dust.

The emptied chest cavity of a Cape buffalo, and next to it a lion who I imagine was very full and quite satisfied with himself.
