## Would a jaw as flexible as an anaconda's but with the bite force as a hyena's be possible in the animal kingdom?

Probably not. Anacondas and other snakes have such elastic jaws because they are hinged and not connected in the center.

Meanwhile, powerful jaws require a good thick, sturdy build, and a proper connection to the skull really helps, as it allows the full force of the body to be exerted through the jaws. Compare the snake jaws to those of a spotted hyenaâ€™s:
