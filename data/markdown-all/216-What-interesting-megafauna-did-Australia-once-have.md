Of all the continents of the world, Australia has perhaps been most affected, ecologically, by human activity. Its current wildlife - though spectacular as it is - is a mere husk of what it once was during the Pleistocene epoch.

Diprotodon was a relative of modern wombats, the largest marsupial ever to live. It was an estimated 2 meters tall at the shoulder and 2.8 tons in weight - making it as big as a hippopotamus. It is known to have practiced seasonal migration, likely in large herds.

Palorchestes, also known as the “marsupial tapir”, was one of Australia’s weirdest marsupials. Named after its long trunk, it was ecologically more like a ground sloth than a tapir, having huge claws for shearing vegetation from the trees. It really looked like something out of Star Wars.

Another browser to be found in Pleistocene Australia is Procoptodon. This huge kangaroo was taller than a man and weighed 240 kilograms, four times as much as the average person. It’s also known as the “short-faced kangaroo” due to its truncated snout, which was for clipping tough foliage and other browse.

Protemnodon anak is one of my favourites among this Australian megafauna - colloquially nicknamed the “giraffe wallaby”, this huge wallaby was very tall, with an elongated neck that allowed it to forage from the treetops. Its relative, P. tumbuna (bottom right) was a stouter creature which ate ground vegetation.

On the subject of kangaroos and their relatives, I should mention Propleopus, the so-called killer kangaroo. This macropod was apparently carnivorous, and could’ve eaten carrion or even hunted live vertebrates. If you’ve read one of [my previous answers](https://www.quora.com/Which-herbivorous-animal-would-be-horrifying-as-a-carnivore/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"), you’ll know that carnivorous kangaroos are not to be messed with.

Speaking of predators, there were other large carnivorous marsupials in Australia at the time. There was the famous thylacine, and of course Thylacoleo - the “marsupial lion”. Recent discoveries have found that it was more of a marsupial leopard; an arboreal predator which dropped from trees onto its prey.

Australia today has emu’s, but they are dwarfed by the region’s previous flightless birds. The dromornithids were not ratites, but rather fowl - the largest, Dromornis, weighed half a ton or more and was 3 metres tall. Also, since this is Australia, it might have been carnivorous…

Moving on to reptiles, the continent was home to “Megalania”, or Varanus priscus. This was the largest terrestrial lizard ever to walk the Earth, being 7 metres long and around 1,000 kilograms in mass. It was a monitor lizard, related to modern Komodo dragons.

There was also a type of crocodile called Quinkana; it was the last surviving member of a group known as the mekosuchines - terrestrial crocs endemic to Australasia. Quinkana itself was 6 metres long and had long legs adapted for terrestrial movement.

If there’s one thing Australia’s famous for, it’s snakes. Nowadays it has many venomous snakes, but a few of its ancient serpents were giants. Wonambi and Yurlunggur were the last members of a family of constrictors called the Madtsoiids. Both were bigger than anacondas.

There’s a lot more interesting megafauna from Pleistocene Australia - these are just those which are the most eye-catching. Of course, before the Pleistocene, Australia also had many, many fascinating inhabitants, from giant bipedal stegosaurs (Garbina) to mega-pythons (Liasis dubungidula).
