## Why don't birds live communally in caves the way bats do?

Some do! In Southeast Asia, there are numerous species of swifts which nest in caves, mainly in the genus Collocalia. They have the extraordinary capability of determining the position of objects based on reflected sound waves - echolocation. This adaptation is only seen in a few other organisms.

There is another swiftlet genus - similarly found in Southeast Asian caves - called Aerodramus. Like those in Collocalia, they too can echolocate, but what really sets them apart is their nests, which are built out of their own dried saliva.

The nest of one species - the edible-nest swiftlet - is considered a delicacy in China, used in the famous birds’ nest soup. Unfortunately, this has put a lot of pressure on the species and some populations in the Indian Ocean are critically endangered.

Distant cousin to the swiftlets is a family known as the oilbirds. They have convergently evolved a very similar appearance and lifestyle, and even share the ability of echolocation! In fact, cave swiftlets and oilbirds are the only avians which can echolocate.\*

In any case, oilbirds often nest colonially in caves, and come out at night to eat fruit (they are one of only two nocturnal frugivorous birds, the other being the lovable kakapo). There is only one extant species in the family. Also, if you thought the swiftlets’ saliva nests were disgusting, oilbirds take it a step further and make their nests out of their own droppings!

The last type of bird I’ll mention is the cave swallow, which is found in the from the Southern US to the western coast of South America. There are five subspecies, of which three (in South America) nest on cliffs, while two (in North America) prefer caves and sinkholes.

In the USA, some cave swallows have taken to nesting in highway culverts. Here, they are more vulnerable to floods, but studies have shown that these swallows produce more offspring than their cave-dwelling cousins.

So, those are the four types of birds I know of which nest in caves. Thanks for reading!

\*Furthermore, echolocation is known to have evolved only six times in the whole animal kingdom - it’s cropped once in oilbirds, once in cave swiftlets, once in bats, and once in modern cetaceans. Then there are some moths which can echolocate too, and fossil evidence suggests that an extinct group of cetaceans evolved it independently of living ones.
