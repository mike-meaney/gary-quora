## Why are there so many weird animals in Australia and not as many diverse animals in Japan, both being islands?

So, Australia and Japan.

Both, as you say, are island nations. The Land of the Rising Sun is home to hundreds, if not thousands, of endemic species. There are more than twenty whole taxonomic families of organisms (all of them invertebrates) which are found nowhere else.

Despite this, it can’t hope to compete with the land Down Under. This island continent has more endemic species than almost any other nation worldwide, with close to a thousand unique reptiles alone! Additionally, it has seven time’s Japan’s number of endemic families.

So why this disparity? As with most things in nature, it’s probably down to a complex array of contributing factors. These are all the possible factors I can think of, off the top of my head.

Isolation

At first glance, there doesn’t seem to be a drastic difference between the geographical isolation of Australia and Japan. In fact, the former is closer to New Guinea (150 km) than the latter is to Korea (200 km). That being said, if you include Sakhalin Island as Japan\*, the distance is only 10 km to mainland Siberia.

Indeed, Australia and New Guinea have somewhat similar wildlife - they share marsupials, dingoes, cassowaries, and many more taxa. That’s because together they form a sunken landmass known as Sahul. Sahul is cut off from Asia by a region of extremely deep straits known as Wallacea:

Because of this geographical moat, most animals typical of Afro-Eurasia were unable to colonize what we now know as Australia and New Guinea, and their fauna has evolved in isolation from the rest of the world’s - hence the weird endemic animals.

Meanwhile, the waters between Japan and Korea or the Russian Far East are fairly shallow. In fact, during the last Ice Age, the island chain was connected on both ends to mainland Asia, giving non-Japanese animals plenty of time to colonize it.

Size

Japan is bigger than you might think - if magically transported to Europe, the main islands could stretch from the Baltics to the Bay of Biscay, or from Lake Huron to the Rio Grande in North America. However, Australia is much, much bigger:

And Straya’s huge size is important to answering this question. With more space, there’s more room for different species to exist without being driven into competition, and there will inevitably be more biomes.

With different climate zones in the landmass, animals will have to specialize for different environments, so more species will evolve. Due to this, Australia far exceeds Japan in its diversity of virtually all major groups of animals.

Temperature

You probably know that the two countries sit at very different latitudes. The main islands of Japan are sandwiched between the parallels of 30 and 45 degrees north. As such, it has a mild, temperate climate, in general.

Meanwhile, mainland Australia is 39 degrees south of the equator at its most poleward point, and a mere 10 at the tip of the Cape York Peninsula. In other words, it’s a chiefly tropical place.

Therefore, it receives a lot more sunlight than Japan, therefore (where it’s rainy enough) plant diversity is much higher, therefore animal diversity is much higher. Furthermore, much of Japan is very mountainous, and the high altitude can further decrease the temperature.

Lastly…

Human history

I’m no expert on history, but as far as I know, the Aboriginal people of Australia never created what we might call a “civilization” - they built no cities or empires, and what agriculture they practiced was fairly low-impact, environmentally. These things did not come until the continent was colonized by Europeans in the 18th Century.

On the other hand, the Japanese have been altering the environment of their islands for millennia. The cities, castles, mines, croplands, et cetera they created likely contributed to a decline in Japan’s biodiversity.

Granted, Aboriginal hunter-gatherers did actually wipe out many spectacular species of Pleistocene megafauna, but overall, the activities of the ancient Japanese were probably much more disruptive to wildlife than those of contemporaneous Australians.

* * *

So, in short: Australia is more isolated from the mainland, it’s much bigger, it has a wider variety of climate zones, it’s more tropical, and historically its people have had less impact on the environment. Because of at least some of these, and perhaps other reasons I haven’t thought of, Japan’s diversity of endemic species can’t hold a candle to Australia’s.
