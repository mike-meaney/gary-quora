Alright, here goes. Note that some of these - i.e. the camouflaged tyrannosaur one - are just informed speculations, and not based on fossil evidence. Others, like Osteoporosia, are founded on fragmentary evidence, and there are even some of them (such as the Triassic Kraken hypothesis) which I don’t buy into.

*   In the late Cretaceous period, Hateg Island (where Romania is today) was a land of opposites. The principal herbivores were dwarf sauropods the size of ponies, and the largest land animals were enormous pterosaurs called Hatzegopteryx, which were the island’s apex predators.

*   In Jurassic China, a family of dinosaurs called the scansoriopterygids were like real-life dragons. They were reptiles, but had membranous bat-like wings, and were covered in feathers! They couldn’t really fly with these wings, but they could definitely glide.

*   In Brazil’s Bauru Basin, during the late Cretaceous, dinosaurs had almost been outcompeted by crocodile relatives. The top predators came from a group called the baurusuchids, which convergently evolved with theropods in many ways, and there was even a small crocodylomorph with a shell like an armadillo.

*   Earlier on in the Cretaceous, in Australia, there was a very strange stegosaur - Garbina roeorum. For one thing, it was absolutely enormous, an estimated 11 metres long. Secondly, its footprints - the only evidence of it we have - indicate that it could switch to walking on two legs, like a pangolin. It must have been a very intimidating creature indeed.

*   At the end of the Mesozoic, Madagascar was home to many fearsome creatures. In addition to giant burrowing theropods and armoured sauropods, there was a fish-eating dinosaur called Masiakasaurus with the weirdest teeth, which were huge and pointed outwards.

*   Some other Madagascan animals of the time include Madtsoia, a gigantic 8-metre constrictor snake, and Beelzebufo, the largest-ever frog in history. It’s not at all hard to believe that both these creatures ate the dinosaurs of the island.

*   Matherondon was a herbivorous dinosaur, but I would not advise putting your hand in its mouth, or any other part of you for that matter. Its teeth were large for its diet, and scissor-like. Ridged on one side, they were arranged such that they would sharpen each other during chewing.

*   125 million year-old fossils show a pileup of six Utahraptor which died in a quicksand death trap, hunting Hippodraco (aka “horse dragons”). Things evidently got nasty before the pack sank under, as one of the babies was evidently cannibalized in desperation.

*   Majungasaurus, sometimes called Majungatholus, is the only known cannibalistic dinosaur, as numerous bones have identical bite marks in them. Though giant in size, Majungasaurus was comically stubby, with short legs and virtually no arms - in fact it stood only 5 feet high.

*   In the earliest years of the dinosaurs, the world was a very, very weird place. Take for example the ecosystem of the Madygen Formation. There were lizard-like creatures with huge spines (Longisquama), reptiles with wings on their back legs (Sharovipteryx), bizarre sloth-reptiles (drepanosaurs) and gigantic, 60-cm long grasshopper-like insects with raptorial forelimbs, Titanopterans.

*   It’s currently unnamed, but there’s a type of noasaurid theropod from Cretaceous Niger which was fossorial, or burrowing. It was slender, its arms were highly reduced, and its claws were spade-like, excellent for digging. Its discoverer, the famous Paul Sereno, calls it the “weirdest dino he’s ever found”, and said it might have been able to dive under the sand for subterranean prey.

*   Sauroniops was a giant carcharodontosaur from North Africa, and its name means “Eye of Sauron”. I know it doesn’t really have anything to do with the actual creature, but I still think that’s pretty damn metal.

*   Birds are dinosaurs, so birds could well be our best source on the behaviour of extinct dinosaurs. Some paleoartists have imagined, albeit casually, that large theropods might have mimicked trees, like modern potoos and frogmouths do. Seeing a dead tree come to life as a Tarbosaurus would certainly be terrifying.

*   Lythronax argestes, my favourite tyrannosaur, was pretty badass - its name even means “the king of gore”. Even for a tyrannosaur, its teeth are unusually large and show adaptations for crushing bones rather than just slicing meat. The largest predator in its ecosystem, it could well be described as the dinosaur version of a hyena.

*   There are numerous reports of non-avian dinosaur fossils occurring after the K-Pg boundary, among them carnivorous theropods and large hadrosaurs. Though there is currently no evidence for this, perhaps even a few T Rex still roamed in the early Paleocene, hunting the first megafaunal mammals.

*   In South Africa’s Elliott Formation, paleontologists have discovered a monstrous prosauropod, potentially as big as the famous Diplodocus. However, it evidently walked on two legs, making it the largest bipedal animal of all time, and the largest Triassic animal too. Sadly it’s unnamed, as of now.

*   According to many paleontologists, there were venomous dinosaurs. In particular, Sinornithosaurus has peculiar teeth with grooves in thim, which have been interpreted to be means of delivering venom. Thankfully, it was probably a specialist bird-hunter, but I still wouldn’t chance getting bitten by one.

*   Perhaps India’s most iconic dinosaur, Rajasaurus was an impressive theropod related to the aforementioned Majungasaurus. It had a horn on its head, probably for head-butting - however, it lacks shock-absorbing bone on its skull. As such, some speculate that instead of ramming heads, they would have slammed their horns into their opponents’ necks in violent matches, similar to those of giraffes.

*   Amphicoelias fragillimus might be the holder of the ever-shifting title of largest-ever land animal; upper estimates say it was an astonishing 66 meters long and 122 tons in weight. For comparison, a blue whale is 30 and 200. If the size estimates are true, it would surely have been immune to predation as an adult.

*   One of the most spectacular battles to witness during Mesozoic times must have been Giganotosaurus vs. Ekrixinatosaurus, two giant theropod contemporaries. Giganotosaurus (12–13 metres) was larger, yes, but Ekrixinatosaurus (~11 metres) was more robust and had a stronger bite - it could go either way. Such a clash must have happened at least once, and likely many more times.

*   From dinosaur times, there exist bones of the whale-sized ichthyosaur Shonisaurus, arranged in strangely regular geometric patterns. Furthermore, marks resembling tentacle suckers can be found on the bones. Paleontologist Mark McMenamin - and I kid you not - thinks that the reptile was killed by an enormous cephalopod, a 30-metre “Triassic Kraken”, which was intelligent and arranged the skeleton like that deliberately. I’m not joking - [Giant 'kraken' lair discovered: Cunning sea monster that preyed on ichthyosaurs](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111010075530.htm "www.sciencedaily.com").

*   There’s a theropod called Osteoporosia (And yes it’s named after osteoporosis for some reason), known from very fragmentary remains. Some estimate it to be a whopping 15 metres long, which would put it in the range of Spinosaurus. However, this cannot be confirmed until better remains are found. Pictured is its better-known close relative Aerosteon.

*   I have heard/seen people mention the discovery of bite marks in a Triceratops bone, from the Hell Creek formation, evidently caused by some kind of “enormous crocodile” - probably not Deinosuchus. Being found in Hell Creek, it would’ve encountered T Rex too. However, I can’t find a source for this. If it is true, an encounter would look something like this (Deinosuchus and Albertosaurus pictured):

Okay, that’s enough from me. Those are 23 facts about dinosaurs and their contemporaries which are, in some way, terrifying or metal. Hope it’s been enjoyable.
