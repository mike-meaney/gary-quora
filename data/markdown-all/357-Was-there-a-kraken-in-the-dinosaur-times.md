During the Cretaceous period, there were apparently a number of very large cephalopod species. The most well-known is called Tusoteuthis, which is often called a squid (and indeed it was once thought to be) but has since been reclassified as an octopus.

Based on the length of its gladius (a blade-shaped internal structure found in most cephalopods), Tusoteuthis would have been about six to eleven metres long, so the above illustration is actually very conservative, size-wise.

Tusoteuthis lived during the late Cretaceous in a place called the Western Interior Seaway. This was a huge tract of sea which separated the two main landmasses of North America at the time - Laramidia in the west and Appalachia in the east - and was home to a huge menagerie of large and formidable sea creatures.

A much more mysterious Cretaceous cephalopod is Haboroteuthis poseidon…

This one is only known from a chitinous beak, found in Hokkaido in 2015. Thus, very little can be discerned as regards what it looked like, and how big it was. However, based on the size of the beak it is possible that it was comparable in size to the largest modern squids.

11 years prior, a different Japanese Cretaceous squid beak was unearthed, and the species was named Yezoteuthis giganteus. Estimates suggest it was around as large, perhaps even bigger, than the modern giant squid. It’s possible that Yezoteuthis and Haboroteuthis are one and the same.

The final Mesozoic “Kraken” I’ll mention is not a squid or octopus or cuttlefish, but amember of a long extinct cephalopod group - Ammonoidea. Meet Parapusozia seppradensis:

Like the previous three species, this one’s from the late Cretaceous, and lived in Germany (alongside the famous Mosasaurus hoffmani). A member of the ammonites, its enormous coiled shell had a diameter of up to 3.5 metres, and it could have weighed around 1,500 kilograms.

Three times heavier than the largest modern cephalopod, and protected by a 700 kilo shell, this car-sized beast would have been far from easy prey in life, although I would expect that a large Mosasaurus would be up to the task.

So, while the non-avian dinosaurs were roaming the land, there were quite a few “Krakens” lurking in the oceans. Although in some cases the evidence is as of yet unconclusive, it is indeed possible that all four of the species mentioned above were larger than any octopus or squid today.
