The largest Mesozoic shark, to my knowledge, is Ptychodus mortoni. At a spectacular 10 metres long, this shark was a durophage, adapted for crunching tough mollusks like ammonites.

Another huge shark from the time of the dinosaurs is Leptostyrax macrorhiza. This is a relative of modern sand tigers from the Cretaceous which is estimated to have been 9 metres long. Ptychodus was probably quite a bit heavier, though, since it was so robust.

Cretoxyrhina wasn't quite as big as the previous two, but at 7–8 metres long, it was definitely bigger than a great white. He was a feisty fellow; matching bite marks have been found in the bones of fish, pterosaurs, plesiosaurs and even mosasaurs.

You may have heard of the frilled shark, one of the most bizarre extant sharks. If it wasn't badass enough, during the Cretaceous period there was a species - Chlamydoselachus goliath \- which was 6 metres long, as long as a large great white. However, given its serpentine form, it was probably much lighter.

There are two other large Mesozoic sharks I can think of. One, Cardabiodon. Though the popular media seems to be saying it was a 7–9 metre giant, most scientific sources put it at 5–6 metres. That's still great white size, though, so impressive.

Lastly, Pseudomegachasma, perhaps the most obscure shark in this list. It was part of an extinct lineage of filter-feeding sharks which converged on modern megamouths, and it was quite possibly 6 metres long.

Interestingly enough, all these huge sharks come from the Cretaceous period. It seems as though that time was the age of giant sharks for the Mesozoic, just like the Miocene was for the Cenozoic and the Carboniferous was for the Paleozoic.
