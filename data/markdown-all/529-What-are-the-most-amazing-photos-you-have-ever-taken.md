Horseshoe Bend, Arizona. Kind of generic, but still, it looks nice.

A small crocodilian eyeballing me through the glass, also at Shedd Aquarium.

Moving away from America, I’ve taken some nice photos in my home country of Ireland, though it’s a pretty terrible place wildlife-wise (wildlife is mainly what I like to photograph).

Some sea anemones clinging to the side of a rock pool.

Lastly, I have some photos from Africa. I put these last because, unfortunately, the only camera I had when I was there was my phone, which is pretty terrible. Apologies for the woeful resolution.

Those are just a few of many photos I have taken over the past few years. I’m not sure if any qualify as “amazing” (The ones from Africa look really bad due to my bad phone camera), but still, they capture moments, at least. Thanks for reading.
