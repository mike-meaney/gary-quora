## How many more dinosaur species are theoretically out there to find? Have we discovered enough to have a confident understanding of their ecosystems?

> How many more dinosaur species are theoretically out there to find?

Currently, there are about 9,000 identified extant species of bird. Meanwhile, about 700 species of non-bird dinosaurs have been discovered, and I’d say for extinct birds it’s a few hundred. Let’s call it 10,500 in total, for all of Dinosauria.

So, the number of dinosaur species yet to be found must be much, much bigger. I’ve seen estimates that about a million species of birds have existed on Earth. Add to that the many undiscovered species of non-avian dinosaur which doubtless exist, and you get a very big number.

In some cases, yes. Take, for example, the Morrison Formation. Due to its exceptional preservational conditions, we’ve been able to unearth a rich array of dinosaur species and piece together a full ecosystem.

We have five large predatory theropods, five small ones, two stegosaurs, two ankylosaurs, four small ornithopods, one big one, and a wealth of over a dozen sauropods, some of them gigantic.

We’ve also been able to study the flora and vegetation of the ecosystem in detail:

Hell Creek and the Kem Kem Beds would be other examples of other very well-studied Mesozoic ecosystems. However, some times and places are still poorly understood and we do not have a confident understanding of their ecologies.
