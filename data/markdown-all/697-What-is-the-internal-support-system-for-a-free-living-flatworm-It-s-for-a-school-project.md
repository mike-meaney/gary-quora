They have a hydrostatic skeleton, supporting their bodies by means of a hollow cavity filled with high-pressure fluid, the cavity’s walls being covered in muscle. A lot of invertebrates use this.

The diagram below shows a cross-section of a (free-living) flatworm:

The dotted area outside the gut and inside the muscles represent the pseudocoelom, which is filled with water, supporting the worm’s body by means of fluid pressure.
