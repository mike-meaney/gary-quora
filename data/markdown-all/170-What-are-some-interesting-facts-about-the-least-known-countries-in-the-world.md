A great question - to answer it, I’m going to pick three different countries, three which are little-known but nevertheless very interesting.

Tajikistan

Tajikistan is a landlocked Central Asian republic, a bit bigger than Greece, which has a population of over 9 million. Its Soviet-style capital, Dushanbe, lies on the confluence of two rivers, and is backdropped by high mountains.

*   Speaking of mountains, Tajikistan is one of the world’s highest nations, on average. With an average elevation of 3,180 metres, only Bhutan and Nepal surpass it. The many mountain ranges of Tajikistan make it arguably one of the most beautiful countries in the world. Many of its tourist destinations are in the Fann Mountains, such as Iskanderkul Lake pictured below.

Iskanderkul means “Lake of Iskander”, with Iskander being the Persian name for Alexander the Great.

*   While it might seem like a remote, backwater country, Tajikistan is home to some seriously impressive engineering feats. Along the Vakhsh, you can find the towering Nurek Dam - 300 metres in tall, it’s the world’s second-tallest dam. It has a concrete core beneath about 54 million cubic metres of rock and earth, and produces about 98% of the country’s electricity requirements.

With over 900 rivers within its borders, Tajikistan has vast hydropower potential. An even taller dam, Rogun Dam, is currently under construction.

*   In the soaring Pamir Mountains of Tajikistan, you can find the world’s longest glacier outside the polar regions. Named Fedchenko Glacier, its extends over some 77 kilometres, and is over a kilometre deep in some places. It was discovered by the West in 1878, but never really explored until 40 years later, as part of a German-Soviet expedition.

The glacier gets its name from A.P. Fedchenko, a Russian explorer who never actually went there.

Comoros

The Comoros is a small archipelago, consisting of three major islands, which lies in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Mozambique. Its capital is the attractive port city of Moroni, and its population about 850,000. It’s the 24th smallest country in the world, and the only Arabic one in the Southern Hemisphere.

Here are my best facts:

*   The vast majority of the world’s African coelacanths live in Comorian waters. The coelacanth order of fish was thought to have gone extinct over 65 million years ago, but a living specimen was remarkably discovered in ‘38. African coelacanths can grow up to 2 metres in length and weigh around 80 kilograms, but are sadly critically endangered.

A diver is practically dwarfed by a large coelacanth off the Comoros.

*   As early as 1,000 BC, the Comoros may have been inhabited by Swahili traders living in small communities. However, the first “advanced” peoples to colonize the islands likely came all the way from Southeast Asia. In the sixth century, these Austronesian sailors brought farming to the Comoros with Asian crops like rice, and were the first known Asians to contact Africans.

*   In Comorian culture, there is a somewhat controversial practice - the ada, or grand marriage. This is an enormous, extremely expensive wedding lasting two weeks, costing up to 32 million Comorian francs (~60,000 euros). The groom usually pays around three-quarters of this, and is not considered a man until he has an ada. The tradition has been criticized, since most Comorians live in intense poverty.

Brunei

Brunei is a very small nation on the Southeast Asian island of Borneo, which (aside from on its coastline) is entirely bordered by Malaysia. There are a little under half a million residents, of which most speak Malay. There are only fifteen other countries which border just one other country.

*   The home of Brunei’s Sultan, Hassanal Bolkiah, and the seat of the nation’s government is Istana Nurul Iman. This gargantuan palace is the largest single-family residence in the world, with 1,788 rooms, a banquet hall which seats 5,000, a garage containing 110 cars, and a stable of 200 ponies. In terms of floor area, it’s nearly thrice the size of Buckingham Palace.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1710427a4e191e4f1c7a1fbe6bf20778-lq)

The palace is located a few kilometres southwest of the Bruneian capital, Bandar Sewi Begawan.

*   Perhaps the most interesting feature of the capital (Bandar Sewi Begawan) is the area named Kampong Ayer, nicknamed “Venice of the East”. The entire settlement, which is home to some 13,000 people, is built on stilts above the Brunei River. It has existed for centuries, and was even written about by the famous Antonio Pigafetta, who sailed with Magellan.

In historical times, Kampong Ayer was the largest settlement in the country.

*   While Brunei is very small today, it was once a much larger state. The Bruneian Empire lasted from 1368 to 1888, and wrapped around the entire coast of Borneo, even extending all the way up to the northern Philippines. It reached its largest extent in 1400, eventually losing territory to the British, Dutch and Spanish and collapsing.

I was considering discussing more obscure nations, like Turkmenistan and Suriname, but I don’t want this answer to end up being too long so I’ll call it a day here. I hope you enjoyed reading these facts!
