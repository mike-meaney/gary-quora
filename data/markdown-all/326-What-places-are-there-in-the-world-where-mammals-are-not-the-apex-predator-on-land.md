## What places are there in the world where mammals are not the apex predator on land?

Excluding the countless small islands where there are no native mammals, there are a good few places I can think of. Also, I’ll be ignoring invasive species, as they really narrow down the list. As you might expect, all of these places are islands.

Tasmania

While this island is of course home to Tasmanian devils, they’re not really the apex predators. For the most part, they’re scavengers. The species that truly deserves the title is the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle, an endemic subspecies.

Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagles are some of the largest raptors in the world, with wingspans of up to 2.8 metres. They’re able to take down prey as large as wallabies, sheep, and goats, and are bigger than their Australian counterparts due to insular gigantism.

New Guinea

The largest carnivore on this island (except for the saltwater crocodile, which isn’t a land animal) is - by far - the crocodile monitor, Varanus salvadorii. Although not as heavy, it’s longer than the Komodo dragon, with one specimen allegedly being close to 4 metres in length.

Crocodile monitors have been known to hunt large ungulates like pigs and deer, and are even predators of the New Guinea singing dog - a dingo-like variety of feral dog - according to native accounts.

New Zealand

Before humans arrived at New Zealand, the apex predator was famously Haast’s eagle, the largest-ever species of eagle. However, we’ve driven it to extinction, along with the islands’ second-largest raptor, Eyle’s harrier. The most powerful of New Zealand’s remaining native land predators is probably the swamp harrier.

The swamp harrier is a fairly large hawk, with a wingspan of 1.2 - 1.45 metres. It has a varied diet which mainly consists of ground- or water-dwelling birds, but also includes invasive mammals, fish, frogs and lizards.

Komodo

This small, dry island in Indonesia is known worldwide for its Komodo dragons, the largest lizards in the world. 3 metres long and up to 70 kilograms in weight, it’s a pretty formidable carnivore which is unchallenged by any other species in its range.

Komodo dragons mainly eat Timor deer, but will attack prey as large as water buffalo. The only other large land carnivores on Komodo are civets, which pale in comparison to the monitor lizards. All the above also applies to the neighbouring islands of Rinca and Flores, where the dragons dominate too.

Iceland

The western parts of Iceland are home to the white-tailed sea eagle, one of the largest eagles in the world. It is easily a more powerful predator than Iceland’s only native mammal, the Arctic fox. Granted, polar bears occasionally do float to the island, but that’s very rare and they don’t naturally occur there.

On average, the white-tailed eagle is the fourth largest eagle in the world, after the Philippine eagle, Steller’s sea eagle and harpy eagle. Some specimens were recorded with wingspans of over 2 and a half metres, which is beaten only by the Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle previously mentioned.

Galápagos

This one is no surprise, since the islands’ only native land mammals are the hoary bat and a species of rat. They have three native species of raptor - the osprey, the peregrine falcon, and the Galápagos hawk. Of these, the osprey is the largest, but it’s a fish-eater and thus not an apex predator on the land.

So, between the remaining two, the hawk is probably the more dominant and powerful. Galápagos hawks have been documented attacking and killing various large reptiles native to the islands such as marine iguanas, sea turtles and even baby giant tortoises.

While mammals may have a firm grip on most of the continental mainlands, islands often give other groups a chance to shine. It’s nice to have that bit of variety in the natural world.
