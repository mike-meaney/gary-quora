## With its huge raptor-type beak, the shoebill stork looks to have a powerful bite. How powerful is it?

The bill of a shoebill certainly does look pretty frightening…

But does it pack much force? This hasn’t been tested experimentally but, personally, I doubt it’s very strong pound for pound. Here’s my reasoning:

*   A lot of what makes a bird’s beak strong is, of course, the muscles moving it. If you look at the skull of a shoebill, you might notice that there don’t seem to be any prominent protrusions from which to stretch powerful musculature. Because of this, it would appear to me that shoebill storks don’t have particularly impressive jaw muscles.

*   While they do sometimes consume small land vertebrates\*, the shoebill is first and foremost a piscivore, or fish-eater. The freshwater fish it preys on, such as lungfish, are soft and slippery, not tough. Keep in mind that bite force isn’t for catching a victim, it’s for chewing it up afterwards. I’ve watched several videos of shoebills eating and they generally just tip their food down the gullet without chewing.

\*There was one anecdotal report of a shoebill feeding on an antelope calf, but it’s unconfirmed, so I won’t take it into consideration here.

*   Lastly, the unique beak shape which gives this bird its name doesn’t seem to be one in line with producing serious force. The bill is enormous, yes (primarily for the purpose of catching fish), but it’s very wide and shallow. Since animal jaws move vertically, to increase the bite force one should bulk up the beak on the top and bottom rather than to the sides.

Indeed, on that last point, the birds which have more vertically oriented beaks usually have much stronger bites - the likes of parrots, shrikes… and even finches.

Believe it or not, relative to size, the most powerful dinosaur bite force ever, that we know of, is none other than that of the Galapagos large ground finch.

Despite weighing just 33 grams, it bites with a force of 70 newtons - not much compared to Tyrannosaurus’ 57,000 newtons. However, if you scaled this little finch up to T Rex’s size, its beak would produce a terrifying 18.24 million newtons! In other words, it’s 320 times stronger than its Cretaceous cousin - pound for pound, at least.

So, getting back on topic, the answer to your question is this: based on the evidence I doubt that the shoebill would have a particularly strong bite, as birds go.

You could even say that they don’t got the skills to pay the bills.
