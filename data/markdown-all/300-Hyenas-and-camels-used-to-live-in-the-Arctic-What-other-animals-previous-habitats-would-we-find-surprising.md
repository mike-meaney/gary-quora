Several skulls unearthed in Alaska suggest that approximately 100,000 years ago, there were at least some tigers in North America. Assuming they have been identified correctly, Siberian tigers would have migrated over the Bering landbridge to find themselves in a new continent.

During the Miocene epoch, southern Europe was home to a wide variety of apes, such as Dryopithecus, Graecopithecus and Hispanolipithecus. Today the only (non-human) animal in Europe which could be called an “ape” is the Barbary macaque, sometimes erroneously called the Barbary ape.

The jaguar and the puma are two iconic cats of the Americas. However, these usen’t to be New World exclusives - in the Pleistocene, Europe was home to species of both cats - the European jaguar Panthera gombazgoensis and the Eurasian puma Puma pardoides.

As recently as 8,000 years ago, Asia was home to its own species of ostrich, Struthio asiaticus. Ranging from the Arabian Peninsula all the way to Siberia, it is known that this animal encountered humans, for beads made of its eggshells have been found, from which DNA could be extracted.

Members of the hippo family were once found all over the place. They lived in Madagascar (the island’s only ungulates ever), India, Java, and even Mediterranean islands such as Sicily, Cyprus and Malta. Some of these European hippopotami were even bigger than the modern species.

Those are five examples of animals which lived in places they no longer do. I tried to skip over the more well-known instances, such as the cave lions of Eurasia and Alaska.
