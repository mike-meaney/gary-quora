## Do the largest animals on Earth have the most bones, or is each of their bones simply scaled up in size? Which animal has the most bones?

Overall, there is no correlation between size and number of bones - though if you don’t cast your net so wide, there are exceptions. An example would be constrictor snakes. According to one paper:

> Boids, pythonids and the typhlopid genera, Typhlops and Rhinotyphlops, possess a positive relationship between body size and vertebral count, confirming the importance of pleomerism; however, giant taxa possessed fewer than expected vertebrae, indicating that a separate process underlies the evolution of gigantism in snakes.

Essentially, what that means is that, in general, larger snakes of those groups have more bones - up to a certain point. Many giant extinct constrictors have less vertebrae than you’d expect if the trend continued. Look at Titanoboa:

Despite being the longest snake we know of (although Chubutophis is also a contender), it only had 250 vertebrae, much less than some living snakes.

Anyway, that talk about snakes brings us nicely into the second part of your question. The animal with the most bones will surely be some kind of serpent, as they’re so elongated. Some snakes allegedly have 400 vertebrae, although I’ve heard that 350 could be a more realistic maximum.

In any case, for each vertebra there would be two ribs, plus two pelvic spurs, an ilium, and the skull bones. If I recall correctly, squamates have 27 bones in their skull. That gives a range of roughly 1,080–1,230 bones all in all. Impressive.

So, snakes should be the most “boneful” animals. At least among tetrapods - come to think of it, teleost fish have very complex skeletons too.
