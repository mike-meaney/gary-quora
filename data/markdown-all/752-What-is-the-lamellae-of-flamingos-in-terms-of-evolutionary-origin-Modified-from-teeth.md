I always seem to end up with these really technical zoology questions - thermoregulation, dental formulae and the like - so I guess I’ll answer this one.

I don’t specialize in ornithology (I’m more of a mammal guy), but as soon as I looked up “flamingo lamellae”, it was clear what the answer was.

Pectens are comb-like structures found in the beaks of many birds and other animals, notably ducks. Anatids use them as tools for preening and as strainers for their food. Being very similar to whale baleen, which is of course used for filter-feeding, I can assume that these pectens are how the lamellae came about.
