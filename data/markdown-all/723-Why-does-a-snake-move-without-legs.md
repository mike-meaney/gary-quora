Well, there are a few different ways they move.

Undulation: Most snakes use this, as it’s more or less the simplest method of moving on land. Basically, circular muscle rings move the body sideways, pushing against irregularities in the terrain. The resulting waves move at the same speed as the snake, so that all of the snake’s body follows the same path.

Sidewinding: on sand dunes and mud flats, the ground is virtually flat, so undulation won’t cut it. When in contact with the ground, the body is static - the snake “throws” its head forward, and parts of the body follow.

Rectilinear locomotion: undulation is effective, but makes noise. For stealth predators, the extremely slow - but silent - rectilinear locomotion works best. Large ventral scales pin to the ground, while the snake ripples its underbelly - advancing in a perfectly straight line.

There are other ways of moving on land without legs, too. Leeches use something called “concertina”, earthworms use peristalsis, slime molds move their bodies back and forth and extend tendrils, and tiger beetle larvae loop their bodies and roll.
