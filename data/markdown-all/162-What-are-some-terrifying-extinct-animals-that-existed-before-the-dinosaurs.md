There was a time, shortly before the dinosaurs came to domineer over the world, when the most prevalent large animals on land were suchians; relatives of crocodiles. These reptiles fulfilled many roles in the ecosystems of the Early Triassic, including those of apex predators.

In rivers and lakes, there were the phytosaurs. They looked a little like today’s gharials, but with prominent crests on the skull, and serrated, shark-like teeth. Some are classified as dolichorostral - those with long snouts, adapted for snapping up slippery fish. Others were brachyrostral, with powerful broad snouts, and probably dragged thirsty land animals to a watery grave.

Another group of note was the rauisuchians, which evolved around 250 million years ago. They resembled their modern crocodylian relatives in many respects, but dwelled on the land, and - in some cases - were even bipedal. The largest species were up to 10 metres in length, though the ones before the very first dinosaurs were usually a little smaller.

However, perhaps the most outlandish and intimidating of Triassic terrors were the erythrosuchids. These carnivores were found all over Pangaea over 240 million years ago, and were instantly recognizable due to their comical proportions. All known species had ridiculously oversized heads compared to their bodies.

This disparity is most pronounced in the largest species of all, Erythrosuchus. It was five metres long, a full metre of which constitutes its gigantic head. Proportionally, it had the largest skull of any land vertebrate in history, a feature which it used to house immensely strong jaw muscles, perfect for crushing bones. Thus, erythrosuchids were likely the hyenas of their day.

Interestingly enough, during the Permian period (which preceded the Triassic), the dominant land-dwellers were not reptilian at all, but rather therapsids; early cousins of mammals. The era we are currently experiencing is therefore not the first time therapsids have ruled the world, and had there not been a devastating extinction of apocalyptic proportions after the Permian, their reign would have extended far into the Mesozoic.

Among these mammal-like beasts, there were some pretty terrifying carnivores. Two stand out above all others: first of all, there’s Inostrancevia. It belonged to a family called the gorgonopsids, strongly built predators who were the first ever animals to develop saber teeth.

Inostrancevia was the largest of them all: its exact weight isn’t known, and estimates vary wildly, but it was several hundred kilograms at least.

The next Permian powerhouse on the menu is Anteosaurus. It was even larger than its saber-toothed contemporary, weighing in at a gargantuan 600 kg. After Scutosaurus (the armoured herbivore in the illustration above), it’s the largest known land animal that predates the dinosaurs. With a stocky, muscular build and a huge skull evidently built for head-butting competitions, it would have been a fearsome carnivore in Permian South Africa.

This has been a brief sneak peek at some of the most frightening terrestrial creatures that roamed the world before the advent of the dinosaur era. I haven’t even touched on the colossal amphibians, the freakishly large arthropods, or the sharks. I would, but alas, time is currently a limiting factor.

One marine species that I could never skip over, however, is the famous Dunkleosteus. This nightmarish sea monster was likely the biggest pre-dinosaur animal of all: its mass is estimated at around 4,000 kilograms! It owes much of this bulk to the thick armour plating it carried. Even its huge, crushing teeth were made of solid bone, well-adapted for its predatory habits.

So, that brings us to the end of my condensed summary. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading about these frightful fellows of bygone days. Thank you very much for sticking around, and have a great day.
