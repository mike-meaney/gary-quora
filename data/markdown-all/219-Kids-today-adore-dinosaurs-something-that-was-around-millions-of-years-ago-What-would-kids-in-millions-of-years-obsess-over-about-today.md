Hippos

As you can see by the fossilized skeleton above, the hippopotamus was clearly the most powerful and terrifying carnivore of the Holocene. The largest of them grew to weigh 3,200 kilograms, surpassing the size of almost all other land animals in their world.

The [remains of other animals](https://journals.co.za/docserver/fulltext/wild/28/2/wild_v28_n2_a4.pdf?expires=1569673055&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=D360D420B0C405FF90CD70133326A2F0 "journals.co.za") such as the smaller mammals Aepyceros and Connochaetes have been found in the stomachs of fossil hippos, proving that this great beast was a meat-eater. In fact, bite marks show that the hippo [was in fact a cannibal](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2927028/Hungry-hippos-Hippopotamus-cannibalism-caught-film-time.html "www.dailymail.co.uk"), eating other members of its own kind.

Its terrible skull was over a meter long and had enormous sharp teeth for demolishing any prey item it encountered. Studies have shown that its jaws could open to 180 degrees, and its prominent sagittal crest and cheekbones allowed it to bite with a staggering 8,100 newtons.

The hippo’s greatest enemy was the Holocene’s most bizarre and massive land animal, known as the elephant. This 6 ton giant had gigantic tusks and no apparent eye sockets. A battle between these two monsters would surely be a spectacle.
