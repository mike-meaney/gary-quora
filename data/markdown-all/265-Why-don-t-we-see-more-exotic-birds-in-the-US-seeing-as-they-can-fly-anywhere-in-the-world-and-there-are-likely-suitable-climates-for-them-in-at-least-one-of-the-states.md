## Why don't we see more exotic birds in the US seeing as they can fly anywhere in the world and there are likely suitable climates for them in at least one of the states?

What you’re probably thinking of when you say “exotic birds” are the colourful, flamboyant avians of the Amazon Rainforest or Indonesia. There’s a reason why you see more of them in those locations - vibrant animals generally tend to be more abundant in tropical rainforest environments.

There are a couple reasons for this. Part of it is that the dense foliage provides a lot of colour, so camouflage isn’t quite as important as it is on an open savannah. Another important factor is that these regions have far more biodiversity, so they inevitably have more bird species with “X feature” - be that bright colours or something else.

The only real tropical rainforest in the Contiguous United States is at the southern end of the Florida Peninsula. And, as we would expect, there are quite a lot of exotic birds to be found here. For example:

*   Roseate spoonbills

*   American flamingoes

*   Scaly-naped pigeons

*   A wealth of iridiscent hummingbirds

*   Gray-headed swamphens (they were introduced, however)

*   Magnificent frigatebirds

*   Scarlet ibises

*   Quite a few species of parakeets

*   Red-whiskered bulbuls (also introduced)

*   Western spindalises

Most of these species are chiefly native to the Caribbean, further south, with southern Florida being the northernmost extreme of their range. It certainly is more lush and tropical than the rest of the Lower 48, but it’s not really the same level of biodiversity as the rainforests nearer to the equator.

One of the only places in the USA you can find that kind of rich birdlife is Hawaii, across the Pacific Ocean. Not only is it biodiverse, but it’s a super-isolated island chain, so of course there’s some wonderful evolutionary weirdness thrown into the mix too. You’ve got:

*   I’iwis (yes, that’s their actual name)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7fc6055352bedaf27fcf0eb220636c77-lq)

*   A host of other Hawaiian honeycreepers, many of which are now extinct. Honeycreepers underwent a rapid adaptive radiation after colonizing the islands.

*   Oahu ‘ō‘ōs (extinct since the late 19th Century)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fbc3cbbaee8311580c6ca35c25f77465-lq)

*   Various tropicbirds

*   Warbling white-eyes

*   White-rumped shamas

Unfortunately, a lot of Hawaii’s amazing bird species have been lost - not only since the arrival of Europeans, but due to the Polynesian settlers before them. Before humans arrived on the island chain, there were giant ducks, huge flightless ibises, weird creatures called moa-nalos, and the bizarre Kauai mole duck:

Of course, other US territories such as Puerto Rico and the other Pacific islands have a similarly tropical climate, and similarly exotic avifauna.

Anyway, to summarize: vibrant and flamboyant birds are much more numerous in tropical rainforest environments, which the Contiguous US has very little of. Not that there aren't colorful birdies in more temperate parts of the States — say, blue jays for example — they're just a lot less common. Besides, because they're more familiar they don't seem quite as exotic.

I hope you guys enjoyed this answer, thank you very much for reading, have a great day.
