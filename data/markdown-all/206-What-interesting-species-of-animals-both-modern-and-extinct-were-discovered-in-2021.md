The most unique animal discovery of 2021 was the brittle star Ophiojura exbodi. It represents not only a new species, but a new genus and a new family as well! Such is its distinctness from any other known brittle star. It was found 400 metres below sea level, off the coast of New Caledonia.

This invertebrate’s most noticeable feature is its eight arms - most brittle stars only have five. It truly is a living fossil, for genetic evidence suggests its lineage split off from modern relatives over 180 million years ago, in the Jurassic Period. The name Ophiojura roughly translates to “Jurassic serpent”.

The largest living animal species we discovered this year is Ramari’s beaked whale. One day in November, a curious sight washed up on a beach in New Zealand’s South Island. A dead marine mammal, over 5 metres in length, pregnant with a calf. It was initially thought to be a True’s beaked whale, a species which had never been sighted anywhere near New Zealand beforehand.

Upon closer inspection of the mysterious arrival’s anatomy, it became clear that it was a cetacean species which had never before been documented. Since its initial discovery just last month, more Ramari’s beaked whales have been found in South Africa. This indicates that they are distributed across the Southern Hemisphere’s oceans, and have evaded identification for centuries.

The species is named after Ramari Stewart, a Māori woman who has long been an influential whale expert. The latter part of the scientific name, Mesoplodon eueu, is also in Māori, meaning “big fish”.

Another notable new mammal is the Benin tree hyrax. Tree hyraxes are a rather bizarre group of arboreal creatures which are found all across Sub-Saharan Africa. They are, surprisingly, among the closest cousins of elephants, and are famous for their shrieking nocturnal calls.

The first time I traveled to Africa, I recall hearing a series of bloodcurdling, high-pitched screams in the night - not exactly conducive to a good night’s sleep. The following day, I found out that these were not the sounds of a brutal stabbing, but rather those of a tree hyrax asserting his dominance over territory.

Researchers have noticed that the hyraxes in some parts of West Africa do not produce these calls, however - rather, they bark. This observation led to further investigation, which revealed that the barking tree hyrax was a unique species in itself.

On the topic of African mammals, there’s also the Nimba myotis - a new bat. Though the animal itself was first discovered in Guinea in 2018, the species wasn’t formally described until January this year, technically making it a 2021 discovery. The big standout feature of this bat is its bright orange colouration, a vibrant change from the usual dull browns of its relatives.

The Nimba myotis gets its name from its habitat, the Nimba Mountains of Guinea. These highlands are an example of what are often referred to as sky islands; their slopes are so steep and towering that the ecosystems found on top are unique and cut-off from the “mainland”.

Another region which is home to spectacular sky islands is the Guiana Shield of South America, an fascinating mountainous region which I covered in detail in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-real-life-lost-world-ecosystems/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"). In 2021, scientists discovered a new species in the Guiana Shield: our second orange animal in a row, the frog Synapturanus zombie.

It is one of three different Synapturanus species which were newly described this June. You’re probably wondering where it gets the name “zombie” from - according to its discoverers, this title was inspired by the way they dug bare-handed in the mud and rain, searching for the frogs, which reminded them of a zombie movie.

Another new species with an interesting scientific name is Strumigenys ayersthey. This ant, which has a long, formidable pair of mandibles, was identified in Ecuador in May. Its specific name honours the late artist Jeremy Ayers. Usually, when species are named after people, they take a suffix - -i if it’s a man, \-ae if it’s a woman. However, the ant breaks the mould with the suffix \-they, chosen to promote inclusivity and represent those who do not identify with either gender.

Speaking of insects, there’s a remarkable zoological achievement of 2021 I ought to include. Over the course of just two field trips to the island of Sulawesi, the Indonesian curator Raden Pramesa Narakusumo collected and identified 28 new species of weevil in the genus Trigonopterus. Some of them, too, have noteworthy names, such as T. corona, which is a reference to the pandemic.

It goes to show that, if you know what you’re looking for, you can still venture off into the jungle and return with bounteous discoveries like an explorer of old. Mind you, while very impressive, this doesn’t match Narakusumo’s previous 2019 feat, when he discovered more than 100 Trigonopterus species!

Of course, there are many more newly found arthropods I could discuss. Back in April, a giant, stunning centipede from Taiwan and the Ryukyu Islands of Japan was discovered - Scolopendra alcyona. 20 centimetres long, it’s the largest centipede found in both nations, and - very uniquely - it lives an amphibious lifestyle, inhabiting streams and preying on shrimp.

There’s also Wallace’s sphinx, a moth with fascinating historical significance. Once thought to be a Madagascan subspecies of the wider-ranging Morgan’s sphinx, we now know that it is a distinct species of its own. However, well over a century prior, it represented the first time that the theory of evolution by natural selection had been used to make a prediction, a critical milestone for the idea’s widespread acceptance.

In 1862, Charles Darwin received a specimen from Madagascar: an exceptionally long orchid. He reasoned that there must be an insect on the island which had a proboscis long enough to pollinate the flower; otherwise, it couldn’t reproduce. A contemporary of his, Alfred Russell Wallace (the man who independently came up with natural selection) predicted that it would be a sphinx moth.

In 1867, a Madagascan sphinx moth with a huge proboscis exactly the length of the orchid flower was discovered, and the naturalists’ hypotheses were confirmed. 155 years on, we found out that this moth is a unique species, not just a subspecies.

Turning from a creature steeped in history to one which owes its discovery to the marvels of the modern world, we have the Churah Valley kukri. It’s the latest example of a phenomenon which seems to be growing more common - entirely new species being discovered via social media!

Last year, a couple of strange dots in a photo on Twitter were identified as an unknown parasitic fungus. Now, in 2021, a new species has been described from India’s Churah Valley after herpetologist Zeeshan Mirza saw an unusual kukri snake posted on Instagram. Who knows how many more animals will be revealed through the power of these platforms?

Another reptile new to science from 2021 is the aptly named nano-chameleon, Brookesia nana. A rainforest-dwelling resident of Madagascar’s northern mountains, it is possibly the smallest reptile on Earth! To quantify reptile size, herpetologists use a measurement called the snout-vent length: the length from the nose to the cloaca.

The smallest known reptiles before the discovery of the nano-chameleon (two gecko species of similar size) have a snout-vent length of around 16 millimetres. B. nana, on the other hand, is a stupendously short 13.5 millimetres! This could mean that it’s the tiniest of all. Here it is, pictured below, dwarfed by a thumb.

After only covering a fraction of the living animal discoveries we’ve made this year, I’ll now quickly move on to some paleontological finds. We discover new extinct species at a faster rate than we do modern ones - for example, this year, 42 new dinosaurs were identified - so I’ll showcase the coolest ones here, for brevity.

First of all, everyone’s favourite, the dinosaurs. In Chile, the ankylosaur Stegouros was unearthed. It lived more than 70 million years ago, and had a very unique, fern-like array of bony serrations lining its tail. It was also remarkably small for an ankylosaur, measuring only a couple of metres in length.

Earlier in the Cretaceous, around 90 million years ago, there lived the huge carnivore Ulughbegsaurus. Measuring 8 metres in length and weighing a metric tonne, it takes its name from the 15th Century ruler Ulugh Beg, as both saurian and sultan roamed Uzbekistan.

An apex predator, it dominated even the tyrannosaurs in its ecosystem, which at the time were still small and limber - a shadow of their glory to come. The size comparison below is proof that being an early cousin of T. rex. doesn’t always mean you’re the top dog.

Next, one of the biggest dinosaur discoveries of 2021 by far. On the Isle of Wight, two brand new spinosaurs have been discovered, dubbed Ceratosuchops and Riparovenator. Both lived at the same time (125 million years ago) in the same place, and were of similar size (8–9 metres long). It’s unclear how they avoided competition in their shared ecosystem.

That said, the year’s biggest dinosaur discovery in a literal sense was definitely that of an as of yet unnamed titanosaur in Argentina. It lived 98 million years ago, and though the remains are too incomplete to infer measurements with any certainty, it’s quite possible that it may have been the largest land animal ever to live, weighing 100 tonnes or more.

On the other end of the Americas, in Greenland, we have the unique dinosaur Issi saaneq. Its remains were initially excavated from the frozen wastes in 1991, but it’s taken three decades for them to be properly studied and pronounced as a unique species. An early, 214 million year old relative of the sauropods, Issi is the only non-avian dinosaur known from the island of Greenland to date.

There were some fascinating avian dinosaur finds this year as well. In China, its incredibly well-preserved fossil was found; even the imprints of the animal’s feathers could be clearly made out. These imprints show that Yuanchuavis had a pair of super long tail feathers, a feature which we haven’t seen in any other extinct bird yet. It

Another, much more recent bird described in 2021 is Kairuku waewaeroa, which lived around 30 million years ago. Its fossil was found in 2006, by a group of New Zealand schoolchildren! Originally presumed to belong to another, closely related species, this year it was discovered that it is a distinct variety of its own.

The last prehistoric species I’m going to talk about is the most recent of all: a potential new human species, Homo bodoensis. This early human type arose in Ethiopia 750,000 years ago. Much like some of the previous extinct animals, its fossils were discovered many years prior (in 1976, in this case), but only recently scientifically described as species.

As you can see, 2021 has been quite the year for zoology and paleontology. This answer, though exhaustively long, represents just a small portion of what we’ve uncovered about the natural world in the past 12 months! Nevertheless, I hope you’ve enjoyed reading it. Thank you very much, have a great day.
