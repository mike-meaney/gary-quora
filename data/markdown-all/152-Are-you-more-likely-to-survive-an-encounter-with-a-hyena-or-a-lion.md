You’d have better chances with a hyena. Aardwolves are harmless, and striped and brown hyenas are just reclusive scavengers.

Spotted hyenas are enormously powerful apex predators, but believe me, they avoid humans like the plague. Seriously; say you were observing a clan of hyenas in the wild, seated in a safari jeep. Stand up (revealing your “true human form”) and they’ll all scatter instantly, even though you’d been with them already.

Occasionally, though, run-ins do occur, and end with things like this:

However, for the hyena, him and all his family will be killed overnight in vengeance. This is why they stay away from humans.

Lion attacks, on the other hand, are much, much more common. You may have heard of the infamous Tsavo Man-eaters.

In Kenya, 1898, this pair of maneless male lions killed 28 construction workers who were building a bridge over the Tsavo River, and prompted hundreds more to flee the region. In 2004, a Tanzanian lion was shot who had killed 34 locals by himself.

Why are lion attacks so much more frequent? Because they’re less afraid of humans, probably. Why is this? Who knows, although it must be said that lions don’t receive half as brutal persecution most of the time.

Another thing to consider that hyenas are perhaps the biggest competitors to hunter-gatherers in Africa, and have been that way for millions of years since the emergence of the Homo genus.

So, to wrap things all up, this is why I would rather encounter a hyena than a lion - hyenas are simply more likely to flee. In the event of an inevitable attack, however, I would prefer death by lion. Hyena kills must be among the most excruciating deaths in all the natural world.
