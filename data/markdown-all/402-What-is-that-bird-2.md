The bird in your photo is a violaceous turaco, whose scientific name is, well… Turaco violaceus.

Here’s the bird OP saw, for comparison, for those reading this in their feed:

I’ve written about turacos quite a few times before, and they really are amazing. There are over 20 species, all found only in Africa. That beautiful red colour which most of them have somewhere comes from a special pigment called turacin, a compound unique to turacos.

Their feet have a very strange anatomy, which you can even see in your photo. Notice that on the bird’s right foot, one of the toes is at a weird angle, perpendicular to the two at the front. This third toe (of four) is extremely flexible, and can pivot all the way back so that the digits make an X shape. With this configuration, turacos are able to run along tree branches without falling.

Speaking of weird digits and trees, when turacos are born, they have a tiny little claw on each wing, harkening back to the dinosaurs of the Mesozoic Era. This helps the babies climb up trees quickly, in the period of their life where they are most vulnerable to ground predators. Once they grow up, they lose this claw. The babies of the hoatzin also have this feature, and it’s a wacky bird in itself.

So, those are a few interesting facts about the beautiful bird you saw. Thanks for asking, and thanks everyone else for reading. Have a great day!
