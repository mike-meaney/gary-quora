There is a bioluminescent fish which I think is beautiful in an alien sort of way, the stoplight loosejaw, Malacosteus sp.

Stoplight loosejaws are the only fish that produce red light. This is because most fish can’t see red light - and that works tremendously to the loosejaws’ advantage. They can percieve the color red, so they can light up the darkness while still remaining invisible to their unsuspecting prey.

Another strange thing about the stoplight loosejaw is its nightmarish set of jaws. They have lost the skin on the bottom of their mouth, so their extremely complex jaws can shoot out and grab victims with minimal water resistance. Also, they have pharyngeal teeth in the back of their mouth.

What I love about these fish is that they look like something you’d expect to find on an alien planet, but are in fact just another type of weird animal. Death by loosejaw would be swift but totally unexpected - imagine swimming through pitch-black darkness and then being snatched and thrown into an invisible maw.
