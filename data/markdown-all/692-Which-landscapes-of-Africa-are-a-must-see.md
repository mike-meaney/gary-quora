The Serengeti, and the adjoining Maasai Mara, are absolutely must-sees:

I’d also recommend Kruger National Park in the south:

For me, I’m just satisfied with wherever there’s wildlife, but various landscapes such as Victoria Falls draw in many visitors:

If you’re only looking to go to one country in Africa - which you probably are, given the financial consequences of such travel - I’d say Kenya, or Tanzania. They’ve got all the best wildlife parks, plus some beachside areas if that’s not your thing.
