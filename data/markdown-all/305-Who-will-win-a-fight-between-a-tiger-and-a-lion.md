There are only two places in the world where wild lions and tigers coexist, and neither are jungles. The first is India’s Gir Forest, a sort of arid woodland, home to the last Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica), and also tigers.

However, as far as I know, there are no records of lion-tiger conflicts there. The second place is Tiger Canyons, in South Africa. This reserve has a population of tigers introduced by conservationist John Varty, which are technically wild since they roam and hunt free of human intervention.

According to the website, the park is also home to cheetahs, spotted hyenas and indeed lions. Again, there has been no known conflict between the two pantherines. However, in the past, I think it’s safe to say that lions and tigers probably did fight occasionally.

Previously, there were other “lions” outside Africa - the Mosbach lion P. l. fossilis, the cave lion P. spelaea, and the American lion P. atrox. In fact, there is a fossil site in Russia - Geographical Society Cave - which contained both cave lions and tigers right in the same spot, along with cave hyenas, Amur hyenas, wolves, leopards, lynxes, bears, foxes, raccoon dogs and dholes. Sounds fun.

Even outside of the Old World, such battles were a possibility. There are suspected 100,000 year old tiger fossils from Alaska, during a time period in which the region was inhabited by Beringian lions.

There is also quite flimsy evidence suggesting the existence of African tigers - some controversial fossils, various local East African stories of large striped cats, and a mysterious Egyptian relief. However, the evidence at present is not convincing, so it’s nothing worth banking on.
