I can't write a long answer right now since I'm typing on my phone, but it appears to be a small toothed whale, most likely a dolphin or porpoise.

I believe that the harbor porpoise, shown above, has a range which included Arctic areas, though there are probably other toothed whale species which are sympatric with polar bears.

The smooth appearance of the “skull” might be due to the fact that it is not a skull at all, but the blubbery subcutaneous layer of the head.

The skin also appears dark bluish-grey, so it seems very likely that this is either a dolphin or a porpoise.
