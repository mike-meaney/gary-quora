Good question! For wild animals, I think it might well be this one:

It’s not a very good photo, but it sure as hell has a lot in it. In the very back, we have a herd of plains zebra:

Then, in front of them, a herd of Cape buffaloes.

In the middle, you can see two birds.

On the left, there’s a black-headed heron with its neck stretched out, and to the right of it, there’s a very bizarre and awkward bird called a long-tailed widowbird. It’s a male, characterized by absurdly large tail feathers.

Then, in the foreground, there’s another bird.

That one’s probably a cattle egret - it could be a great egret, but the neck looks too short to me.

So, that makes five different animal species in plain sight. However, there are two more which are a bit harder to spot. Next to the egret, you have this guy:

An Egyptian goose, sadly decapitated by my camera. If any of you are wondering, the birds in the water on the far left are also probably Egyptian geese.

But the most obscure of all of the species on show is this one:

Not the calf, but the feathered friend in front of it. It’s a lapwing or plover of some sort - most likely a spur-winged lapwing, in my opinion.

So, that makes seven animal species, in the wild, in one photo. There are some brown lumps near the treeline which could be warthogs, or baboons, or something, but the photo isn’t clear enough for me to confirm that they’re animals at all.

Speaking of which, if you’d like to get a better view of these species here are some better photos of each, also taken by me, but in different places:

In any case, I took the photo of the big seven in Lake Nakuru National Park, when I visited Kenya last summer. The second set were also taken on that trip, with the zebra, widowbird and egret also being from Nakuru, the buffalo and goose being from the Ol Pejeta National Reserve, and the heron and lapwing from the Maasai Mara Game Reserve.

So, as far as I know, seven is the answer. That is, of course, discounting things like zoos, museums and aquariums in which animal species have been artificially compiled. Thanks for asking!
