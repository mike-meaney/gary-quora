The giant sabertooths - Smilodon, Xenosmilus, Amphimachairodus etc. - were so big because they were specialized megafauna-hunters. The Pleistocene and Miocene were both times when grasslands were abundant and huge herbivores were very common.

It is, more or less, a similar story for entelodonts. The likes of Archaeotherium and Daeodon lived alongside some huge herbivores - even Paraceratherium in the case of the former - and their large size helped them to tackle these huge prey items.

Andrewsarchusâ€™ story is more like that of the short-faced bear. It was more scavenger than predator, at least when it did eat meat, and large size is something that comes in very handy when you want to muscle a kill off predators or other scavengers.
