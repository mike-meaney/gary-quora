I’d say that all extant ones do. All mammals have a limbic system in their brain, which is not a distinct system but a collection of organs which are responsible for producing emotions.

That green thing is one of two structures, located on either side of the brain, called the amygdala. It is not responsible for sadness per se, but rather triggers the emotion in response to various stimuli. These can come through the hippocampus, in the form of sad memories, or via something called the medial temporal lobe, when you are told a saddening fact or piece of information.

All these structures are present in the brains of all mammals alive today, so we can assume that all mammals feel sadness.

However, the complexity of the organs varies from one mammal to another. In dimmer mammals like hippopotamuses, baleen whales and domestic livestock, the capacity for grief may be significantly reduced, but in other animals, it is shockingly human-like.

An example would be the African elephants, which shed tears at the deaths of their herd-mates, defend their corpses from lions and hyenas, and even bury them.

Macaques also mourn their dead:

In a scene from the excellent Blue Planet II, a pilot whale carried her dead calf around with her for days.

The show claimed that the calf had died from drinking plastic-contaminated milk, but the authenticity of that statement is controversial (I don’t really see why people get so worked up about fake news when it can only do good, but whatever.) Regardless, it certainly shows that cetaceans - at least toothed whales - have the ability to experience grief.

Thank you for asking, and I hope the answer is satisfactory.
