Most mammals are colorblind or at least have poor colour vision, so advertising to conspecifics with color isn't really worth it.

Most sauropsids on the other hand can perceive colours well, and fish are only brightly colored because they live in coral reefs. Obviously, no comparable environment exists on land.

Thanks for the A2A, hope this answers your question.
