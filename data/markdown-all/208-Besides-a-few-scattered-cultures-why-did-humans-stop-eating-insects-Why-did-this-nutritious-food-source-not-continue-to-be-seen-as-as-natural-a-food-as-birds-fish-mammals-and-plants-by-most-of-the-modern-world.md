## Besides a few scattered cultures, why did humans stop eating insects? Why did this nutritious food source not continue to be seen as as natural a food as birds, fish, mammals, and plants by most of the modern world?

I’m afraid “A few scattered cultures” is something of an understatement here. It’s estimated that over 2 billion people, belonging to some 3,071 ethnic groups and living in at least 130 different countries, eat insects on a daily basis.

This practice, known as entomophagy, has only really “stopped” in Europe, northern Asia, the USA and Canada\*. For the most part, anyway - there are a handful of insect-based foods which are eaten in Europe, such as casu marzu, a maggot-filled cheese from Sardinia.

\*I couldn’t find information on insect-eating traditions in Central Asia and the Pacific, so I’m not sure if they exist or not in those areas.

Of course, the question remains - why did these regions stop eating insects? They’re easy to find, usually found in great numbers and, for their size, they’re packed with protein. One popular explanation is that when societies find other stable sources of protein -i.e. livestock - the eating of insects becomes taboo.

This is highly unlikely, however, as there are several cultures around the world with strong traditions of both entomophagy and pastoral farming. One good example would be the cattle-herding peoples of southern Africa, which also frequently eat mopane worms - a type of moth caterpillar.

Another common explanation is that it’s because of the food laws in the Abrahamic Religions. True enough, Judaism forbids most insects (although some communities do consume certain species of locust, which they consider kosher), and Christianity of course descends from that faith.

In Islam, it’s less certain whether insects are halal or haram; some maintain that all insects and creeping creatures should be forbidden, while others say that locusts are permissible.

In my opinion religion certainly could be a contributing factor, but I doubt it’s sufficient to fully explain the practically insurmountable aversion to entomophagy in Western culture. One reason which I think is a bigger part of it, but nevertheless haven’t seen brought up before, is very simple.

Maybe it’s just because there ain’t no bugs to eat.

Europe, Asiatic Russia, the United States, Canada - all have precious little species of edible insects, chiefly due to the fact that biodiversity generally decreases as you move away from the equator. Thus, it makes perfect sense that in these regions, entomophagy is taboo.

Let’s try an opposite approach and look at the dark countries. Sure enough, plenty of Chinese eat silkworms:

“Big-butt ants”, or Atta laevigata, are popular in Brazil and Colombia:

Many Mexicans eat grasshoppers:

More so than perhaps anywhere else, entomophagy is common in Southeast Asia:

And in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, caterpillars are seen as typical food. As an aside, a not-so-fun fact: in 2016 a controversial tax on caterpillars in this country caused an ethnic dispute that resulted in 16 deaths.

Likewise, in nations which are more in the middle of the spectrum on the map, such as Saudi Arabia, New Zealand and some North African countries, insect consumption exists, but is uncommon, usually limited to indigenous minorities.

So, as is often the case, it seems to me that the simplest explanation is the truest. In places like Europe and the USA, there are very few species of insects which can be eaten, thus people did not eat insects, thus the eating of insects is considered disgusting in said places.
