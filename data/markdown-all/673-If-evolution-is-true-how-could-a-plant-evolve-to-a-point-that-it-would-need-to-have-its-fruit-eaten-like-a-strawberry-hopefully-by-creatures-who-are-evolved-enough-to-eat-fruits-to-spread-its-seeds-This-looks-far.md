## If evolution is true, how could a plant evolve to a point that it would need to have its fruit eaten (like a strawberry), hopefully, by creatures who are evolved enough to eat fruits, to spread it's seeds, This looks far more like design?

You don’t seem to be of the thinking breed of human so I’ll make this super-clear for you.

Plants do not move. Animals move far. Seeds need to go far. Seeds in animals go far. Problem solved.

Is that succinct enough?
