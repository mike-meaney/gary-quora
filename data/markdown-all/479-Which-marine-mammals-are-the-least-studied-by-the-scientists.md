The vaquita porpoise would be up there.

The vaquita, as the world's most endangered marine mammal, is understandably poorly-studied. Sightings of live, wild animals, at least by scientists, are virtually unheard of, so most of what we know about them is derived from beached ones or retrieved carcasses.

They have an estimated population of 6-22 individuals, although it's unlikely that it's greater than 10. It could just as well be as low as six - we just don't know. In the light of this mysteriousness, I really hope it's closer to the upper estimate, but I fear that is not the case.

Much of their biology concerned with their life and behaviour - which is hard to tell from dead ones, of course - is unknown, as you would imagine. To quote Wikipedia;

> Little is known about the life cycle of vaquitas. Age at sexual maturity, longevity, reproductive cycle and population dynamics estimates have been made, but further research is needed. Most of these estimates come from vaquitas that have been stranded or caught in nets. Some are based on other porpoise species similar to vaquitas.

If Iâ€™m rational, I must say that vaquita porpoises will probably go extinct, and that is very sad. However, the optimistic side of me hopes that some miraculous turn of fate will save them.
