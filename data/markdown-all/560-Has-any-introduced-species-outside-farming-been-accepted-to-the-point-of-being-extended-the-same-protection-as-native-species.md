## Has any introduced species, outside farming, been accepted to the point of being extended the same protection as native species?

There are a lot of good examples you’ve gotten so far, but I’ll add one more to the list, with the dingo.

The dingo, Canis familiaris dingo, is a variety of feral domestic dog brought to Australia by Sulawesian seafarers. Granted, the introduction was a long time ago, thousands of years ago in fact, but it’s still an introduced species.

The dingo is protected in most government-owned national parks and wildlife reserves in Australia, despite being non-native, because it serves as a proxy for some of the continent’s extinct large predators, keeping the still-surviving large herbivore populations in check.

I’ve written about this before, see [Gary Meaney's answer to Why is the Dingo considered important for Australian wildlife conservation despite it being nothing but a non-indigenous, Asian dog breed which went feral after being introduced by sailors?](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Dingo-considered-important-for-Australian-wildlife-conservation-despite-it-being-nothing-but-a-non-indigenous-Asian-dog-breed-which-went-feral-after-being-introduced-by-sailors/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com").
