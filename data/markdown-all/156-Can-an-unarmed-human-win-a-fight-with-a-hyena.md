I suppose it depends on the species. The average person wouldn’t have much trouble with an aardwolf. They’re termite-eaters, not apex predators, and extremely shy. Fully grown they weigh around 10 kg, or about as much as a beagle.

A striped hyena or brown hyena would be much more challenging. They average 35 and 40 kilograms in weight respectively, so they’d be more comparable to an Alaskan malamute. Keep in mind, however, that while they do hunt live prey, it’s mainly smaller animals, and the bulk of their diet consists of scavenged matter.

Both species are generally skittish in the presence of humans, although striped hyenas have killed people - almost all of them, however, were young children, with only a couple of documented adult deaths. Considering unarmed men have killed pumas and leopards in fights before, I’d still say yes.

Now, the spotted hyena is where things get a bit debatable. First of all, there’s size to consider; their weight range is broad, but females of 90 kilograms have been known. Let’s be more conservative and go with a 60 kg individual. As you can see pictured below, they’re bigger than most people realize.

Unlike other hyaenids, spotted hyenas are active predators and get most of their food by hunting live prey - in coordinate groups, they can kill elephants, or the likes of zebra and wildebeest when solo. They’re much more muscular than the other species, and have the strongest bite force by far.

There’s also the fact that they have much more of a pedigree for human-killing than any other hyena species. This phenomenon varies greatly depending on the region, but Malawi has it especially bad - hyena attacks are most common in this country, with one notorious pair of individuals killing an astonishing 27 people in one year.

If we exclude the option of the spotted hyena running away, I’m confident that the average person would not be capable of physically subduing an animal with such strength and speed. However, I’m sure some would be up to the task - they’d just be a very, very small percentage of the population.

So, in summary: probably, yes, but a spotted hyena specifically would be extremely challenging to defeat even for the most physically able and experienced.

Before I go, I should ask that you do not venture into the wild with intent to challenge a hyena to a gladiatorial showdown, as this is generally considered to be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of both parties. Thanks for reading, have a great day.
