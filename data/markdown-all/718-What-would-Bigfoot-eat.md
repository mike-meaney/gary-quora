I assume that you know that Bigfoot is not confirmed to be a real creature, so I take it you mean what it would eat were it real.

On the old Speculative Evolution wiki, a guy (His wiki name was Whanggoldpaw) speculated on the evolution of a number of fantasy/cryptid humanoids, including the Sasquatch. Basically, he imagined that a line of apes spread from Africa to Asia during the Pliocene epoch, and became a new species - the Yeti. One population of Yeti migrated to Japan, becoming the Hibagon, and another crossed the Bering strait and became the Sasquatch (Aka Bigfoot).

The closest proxy we have to a giant ape in the real world is Gigantopithecus, an extinct hominid. In 2011, there were some revelations on its diet, but they only really discovered that it ate “C3 plants”. Since C3 plants make up 95% of the world’s plant biomass, I presume that’s not very helpful to you.

However, it lived in an environment with lots of bamboo forests, so it may have eaten bamboo. But, Bigfoot lives in North America, so that wouldn’t have been an option. Bamboo is a type of grass, though, so I’d say Bigfoot would either be a grazer, like Gigantopithecus, or a browser, like most modern great apes.
