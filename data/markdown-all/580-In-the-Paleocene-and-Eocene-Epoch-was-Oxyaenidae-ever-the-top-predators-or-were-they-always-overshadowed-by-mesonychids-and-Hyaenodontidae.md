## In the Paleocene and Eocene Epoch, was Oxyaenidae ever the top predators or were they always overshadowed by mesonychids and Hyaenodontidae?

I’d say that there were instances where they at least shared the apex predator position. This is Sarkastodon mongoliensis, an oxyaenid from the Eocene of Mongolia.

Sarkastodon was an enormous animal, with an estimated weight of 800 kilograms (although I believe some studies have found 200–400 to be more plausible). I find it hard to believe that such an animal was “overshadowed” by predators from the other two families.

That being said, it did share its habitat with the -200 kg carnivore Mongolonyx robustus,which would perhaps have been a rival. Still though, it would probably be more like lions and spotted hyenas in modern Africa - fairly equal competition, rather than dominance.

There was also, in that time and place, the famous Andrewsarchus mongoliensis, of course. This (potentially) 1 ton creature was likely a scavenger though, and it wasn’t a mesonychid or hyaenodont.
