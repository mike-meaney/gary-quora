A herbivorous animal, essentially, is an animal that eats plants. And the main types of plants in the ocean are algae, seaweed and seagrass.

So, what eats algae? Well, everything eats algae. Young fish, tadpoles, insects, waterfowl, snails, you name it. It’s arguably the most important plant in the world, since A) So many creatures eat it, and B) Virtually all plants evolved from it. So, anything that eats algae is a herbivore.

Then there’s seaweed. Again, a major food source for so many aquatic herbivores. I won’t go through all of them, but a few more well-known ones include sea turtles, marine iguanas, crabs, and even some land animals like the brant bird, arctic fox and, of course, humans.

Our last ocean plant was seagrass, the only aquatic form of grass. Manatees famously dine in the expansive submarine grasslands off the coast of Australia, but also eat some seaweeds.

Moving on to omnivores, dolphins will eat both fish and plants. Crabs and many kinds of turtles also are omnivorous.

Lastly, we have carnivores.

Everybody knows the ocean’s top predator - sharks. They’ll eat fish, squid, dolphins, seals, turtles, seabirds and other sharks. One species of shark in Greenland even eats moose, polar bears and reindeer.

However, there are many more predators in the ocean. Barracuda, seals, walruses, squid and moray eels are all examples. But the most deadly predator in the ocean is undoubtedly the orca, or killer whale.

They eat everything from salmon to seals to great white sharks. And, they’re the only living animal besides humans that hunts whales.
