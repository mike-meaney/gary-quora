## If humans were to become extinct, why won't there be any new species to replace us? Is it because intelligent life takes the longest to evolve?

Well, first of all, remember that there are plenty of species today that are technically capable of forming civilizations in the next few million years.

First of all, we have the Cetaceans. Bottlenose dolphins have been documented to have recreational drug use, medicine, complex play behaviour, interspecies relationships, cooperative hunting, and a myriad of other great indications for high intelligence. False killer whales (shown below, right) hunt strategically alongside bottlenose dolphins, and it appears that individuals of both species have their respective “friends”, which they remember and immediately socialize with when pods get together.

Beluga whales have an extremely complex language, and most Cetaceans have been shown to recognize themselves in a mirror - indicating that they are self-aware. Then, of course, we have orcas, which pass on specialized hunting techniques through generations (meaning that they have “culture”), regional dialects and accents, and mimic human behaviours such as throwing snowballs.

Even larger whales, like humpback whales - previously thought to be rather dull - show signs of very high intelligence. Humpbacks have their “bubble-net” tactic of herding fish, and commonly show signs of interspecies altruism, rescuing seals, dolphins and humans from predators. It should also be noted that cetaceans have an entire part of the brain that we lack, the peripheral paralimbic system; meaning that their emotions are more complex.

Then there are our closer cousins, the Primates. The first species most people think of when they hear about primate intelligence is usually either us, or chimpanzees. Chimpanzees, and their closest kin the bonobos, can make and refine tools, learn to use symbols, understand basic syntax and numeracy, decieve other chimps, and can spontaneously plan for future events. They can use and sharpen hunting spears, weave intricate nests with pre-selected material, and might even have some form of religion.

Orangutans and Gorillas are also highly intelligent. The former has been seen - in the wild - using soap, cutting wood with saws, and are the only known nonhumans to have “calculated reciprocity”. Gorillas can use fashion branches into clubs, use sticks to gauge the depth of rivers, and use tree stumps as bridges. One captive gorilla, Koko, was taught to speak 2,000 English words in American sign language.

Contrary to what some might tell you, not all intelligent animals must eat meat. Elephants are really smart, and eat only plant matter. In the wild, they use sticks for fly swatters, help struggling herd members, and can recognize individuals from other family groups. They are thought to be self-aware, and “mourn” their dead loved ones, often performing ritual burials.

Further extending our search to go beyond the mammals, extreme intelligence can be found in birds, too. Firstly, we have Corvids. Corvids represent a family of birds including crows, ravens, magpies and jackdaws, and many signs of intelligence can be found in them. New Caledonian crows have extremely developed tool use, for example, using sticks to make hooks that extract grubs from hollows. Populations on different parts of the island use different styles of hook, each suited to a different style of extracting the grub. In addition to this, we have a plethora of other amazing things, such as using lures to attract fish, episodic memory, and laying grass wreaths on deceased friends in ritual ceremonies.

Among the birds, there are also Parrots and their relatives. The famous African grey parrot, Alex, was able to understand the concept of a word (A vocalization that symbolizes an unrelated object, activity etc.), and some other species such as the kea can use tools in the wild.

Since all life is descended from a single common ancestor, all life has been evolving for the same amount of time. In that respect, we should extend our search for intelligence beyond the vertebrates, where we will meet the Cephalopods. The most intelligent group here, it would seem, are the octopuses, which show many examples of being as such. They can build shelters from shells and debris, appear to play, and steal bait from lobster traps to use to catch their own crabs. The mimic octopus can adjust its silhouette and colour to resemble flatfish and sea snakes, and Humboldt squid show extraordinary cooperation and communication abilities. Many will be familiar with octopuses’ abilities to navigate mazes and open jars.

The animals mentioned above are only a sampling of the world’s most ingenious animals. Along with them, there is high intelligence among meerkats, raccoons, hyenas, rats, and even manta rays.

Some of you may be wondering why I haven’t included dogs on this list. Believe me, I considered it quite seriously, but decided to leave them out of the main list, primarily for one reason. You see, domestic dogs seem to only exhibit their high intelligence and problem-solving abilities in the presence and environment of humans. Wild and feral dogs just don’t seem to be very intelligent. In that sense, dogs are only intelligent in a specialized habitat, because human teaching is not a selection factor in their evolution.

These, as I said previously, are some of the animals I think could potentially form some kind of civilization within a few million years. All have prehensile appendages except the parrots and humpback (Primates have hands, octopuses have tentacles, crows have feet, elephants have trunks and dolphins have… well, they have… (at least the males do) a prehensile appendage, of “an unusual sort”.)

On the subject of intelligence “taking longest to evolve”, remember that evolution has no fixed, universal speed. The rate at which speciation occurs is down to 3 factors: reproductive rate, mixed genes and competition. Bacteria reproduce very quickly, but they don’t mix up their genes very often, since they usually reproduce asexually. Animals don’t do that, but they don’t reproduce as quickly either. Competition is an interesting factor, which essentially means that the lower the resources per organism, the faster evolution occurs. There is very high competition on islands, and I heard recently that a population of iguanas introduced to an island 3 years ago are already a new species.

Another thing is that intelligence will only evolve if such a thing is advantageous to an organism. Intelligent animals need a lot of energy to support a complex brain, and it takes longer for their young to be born because of the brain developing in the womb/egg. Then when they are born, there’s usually only one because of all that development time, and it takes a longer time to teach the offspring how to use their brain. Intelligent animals typically spend more of their lives in a learning phase, which means that they have to survive a long while to be successful.

Those are a few of the disadvantages of intelligence, but there are certainly advantages. However, they will only be advantageous in the right situation, usually for a creature that can get a lot of energy, afford long pregnancy and low brood size, and survive long enough to finish the learning phase.

With that, I conclude my answer. I apologize for its length, but hopefully you found it of interest.

TL;DR: There are many very intelligent animals today which could replace humans, but remember that evolution has no fixed speed and that intelligence isn’t always advantageous.
