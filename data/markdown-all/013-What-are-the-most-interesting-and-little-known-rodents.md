Approximately two out of every five mammal species is a rodent. The 2,000+ varieties in this order inhabit pretty much every terrestrial environment on Earth, and quite a few aquatic environments too. Despite their diversity and abundance, you rarely hear rodents being discussed as interesting animals; rather, they are seen as mundane, or even vile.

That’s a shame, because there are some really fascinating ones out there. Here are a “few” of my favourites.

*   The Malabar giant squirrel, a species which is found only in the subtropical highlands of India. It’s the world’s largest tree squirrel, measuring a whole metre in length, but - even cooler - it is vibrantly colourful. Most mammals are a rather drab hue, as their colour vision is poor, but the Malabar giant squirrel is a gorgeous exception.

*   The Laotian rock rat, also known as the rat-squirrel. It’s endemic to Laos, and perplexed naturalists with its uniqueness when it was discovered in 2005. It was soon realized that it belonged to the ancient rodent family Diatomyidae, which we previously thought had gone extinct 11 million years ago! Because of this, it’s nicknamed the “coelacanth of rodents” - it’s a living fossil, in other words.

*   The bicoloured-spined porcupine of South America. Its namesake feature is its most striking attribute; the spines of this porcupine are yellow with black tips, and said tips get longer and longer towards the front of the body, giving them a cool bicoloured look. The tail, however, has no spines: it’s bare and prehensile, used instead for gripping tree branches.

*   The Siberian flying squirrel. One would imagine that flying squirrels would be inhabitants of steamy jungles, and indeed most are, but this species is very unique in that it resides in icy taigas. It can be found across much of Russia, as well as parts of northern China, Japan, Mongolia, and even Finland and Estonia. This makes it Europe’s only flying squirrel, and Europe’s only gliding animal too.

*   The gruesome house mice of Gough Island. In the 19th century, house mice aboard European ships arrived on this remote volcanic rock in the South Atlantic. Here, they found an abundance of seabirds, which were unadapted to exogenous predators. Believe it or not, the mice took to feasting on the poor birds’ helpless chicks, killing millions every year, and became super-sized in comparison to their mainland counterparts.

*   The Laotian giant flying squirrel, a creature shrouded in mystery. Like the rock rat from before, it’s endemic to Laos, and is known only from a single specimen collected from a shady bushmeat market in 2012. Based on this individual, it is the largest squirrel in the world, measuring over a metre in length. Of course, it has never been photographed in the wild, so a closely related species is pictured.

*   The naked mole rat. They’re so weird that I don’t even have space to do them justice here. Their bizarre attributes include [eusocial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality "en.wikipedia.org") behaviour (like ants, bees etc.) an absence of hair and subcutaneous fat, lifespans of up to 32 years, immunity to cancer, a cold-blooded metabolism, and the ability to survive without oxygen for 18 minutes by flooding their bloodstream with corrosive lactic acid and performing anaerobic respiration. Oh, and they can’t feel pain.

*   The Baluchistan pygmy jerboa. Jerboas as a whole are very interesting, but this one is my favourite because it’s so tiny. Weighing less than 4 grams, it’s the world’s smallest rodent, and moves about by bouncing on its long hindfeet. Hopping is a form of locomotion which has been adopted by many other desert-dwelling rodents, such as jumping mice, hopping mice, the springhare, the kangaroo rat and the kangaroo mouse (muad’dib from Dune).

*   The pacarana, a South American creature which is - to me - like the cooler, underrated cousin of the better-known capybara. It’s the only surviving member of the Dinomyidae, a family which was once hugely successful, containing species such as the 1,000 kg Josephoartigasia: the biggest rodent of all time. Pacaranas today only weigh up to 15 kg, but that still makes them the fourth-largest living rodent species.

*   The anomalures, which look like flying squirrels at first glance, but are only distantly related. Rather, they evolved wing membranes and gliding flight independently of squirrels, making them one of the five instances of “volplaning” evolving in mammals (the other three being colugos, gliding possums and the extinct volaticotheres\*). Anomalures are also unique in that they have keratinous scales underneath their tails.

\*Ancestral bats may have glided too, and indeed bats themselves technically have the ability to glide, though they prefer powered flight

*   The bizarre blesmols, a family closely related to the naked mole-rat. These African rodents spend virtually all of their lives underground, digging complex tunnel systems and pulling plants down below the surface by their roots. They are well-adapted to this lifestyle, with gigantic incisors and massively powerful jaw muscles. Some blesmols have even been known to gnaw inch-deep holes into solid concrete!

Anyways, that’s my take on a compilation of wonderful rodents, some of which you might not have heard of before. Honourable mentions go out to mountain beavers, zokors, viscachas, capybaras and maras. Thank you very much for reading, hopefully you enjoyed the answer, and have a great Halloween.
