## Are there any reliable source about ostrich kick? Some sites says ostrich kicking force is 2000 pounds per inch. and National geographic says that ostrich can kill a lion but l couldn't find the specific case.

Like many other ratites, ostriches may lash out at perceived aggressors with a powerful kick. There have been no recorded human deaths due to this, but people have been non-fatally gored before.

Believe it or not, Johnny Cash himself once had his ribcage crushed from a kick delivered by his pet ostrich. This exacerbated his painkiller addiction, which likely caused (at least in part) his eventual death. So, in a way, at least one person has been killed by an ostrich - and that person was Johnny Cash.

Anyway, back on topic.

Data on the actual kicking force of ostriches is hard to come by online. I only found two “proper” sources which mention any kind of figure; neither cited the original source of their respective estimates.

The first was a sort of [fact sheet](https://shareok.org/bitstream/handle/11244/49998/oksd_ansi_3988_2004-07.pdf?sequence=1 "shareok.org") about ostrich farming in the US, produced by a “poultry specialist” from Oklahoma State University. It says:

> The bird . . . is capable of kicking with a force of as much as 500 pounds per square foot

The second was a [thesis](http://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/bitstream/handle/11295/19110/Jelagat_Studies%20on%20the%20possible%20causes%20of%20losses%20in%20ostrich%20production%20in%20selected%20ostrich%20farms%20in%20Kenya.pdf?sequence=3&isAllowed=y "erepository.uonbi.ac.ke"), also about ostrich farming, produced in Kenya. At one point, it discusses their kicks.

> The main toe is developed almost as a hoof which it can use as a weapon. This toe when used with the strong muscles can deliver lethal kicks capable of tearing a human body open. It is estimated that a kick may have a force of 225 kilograms.

I highly doubt that the first one is true - 500 pounds per square foot is about 3.5 PSI, which would be pathetic and not nearly enough to inflict the brutal damage that ostrich kicks do. It almost seems like they meant to write pounds per square inch.

500 pounds per square inch would be reasonable enough, although still only a quarter of what a kicking horse could manage. I’ve seen 500 PSI cited for ostriches in a few places, including the [funniest WikiHow article I’ve ever seen.](https://www.wikihow.com/Survive-an-Encounter-with-an-Ostrich "www.wikihow.com") The illustrations are breathtaking…

As you said, other places say 2,000 PSI. However, this seems dubious, as that’s about the maximum kicking force of a horse, which I’d imagine would be substantially stronger than that of an ostrich.

All things considered, the only actual scientific source I could find which mentions a plausible estimate for the kicking power of an ostrich is the paper on Kenyan ostrich farms. It said 225 kg (496 lbs), which at the moment is the closest thing to an answer I can give you.
