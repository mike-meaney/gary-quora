## It seems to me lions are just bullies that use force to kill hyenas, who are far more intelligent, cooperative, and versatile. Besides lack of brute force, what social, ecological or intelligence limitations do hyenas have that lions don't?

If I understand your question correctly, you’re looking to know what advantages lions have over hyenas, aside from strength, yes? Also, I assume you’re referring specifically to spotted hyenas, as the other three species are uncooperative and have very limited contact with lions.

I thought about this for a while, and could only really think of two such advantages:

*   Speed \- lions have a top speed of about 80 km/h, in short bursts. Spotted hyenas have one of 64 km/h. Come to think of it however, I’m not sure this really counts - the difference is mainly because of size, which I guess is related to brute force. Relative to its size, a spotted hyena is significantly faster.
*   Habitat \- for whatever reason, spotted hyenas seem to have a strong aversion to tsetse flies, much more so than lions. Tsetse flies are abundant in areas of dense vegetation, so hyenas are restricted from the more forested patches of grassland which lions are not.

Other than those minor limitations, size is the only thing keeping spotted hyenas from equaling lions. In general, they are more intelligent, cooperative, common, adaptable, have a far better sense of smell and bite force, and are roughly as successful in the hunt.
