There are, in fact, many Amazonian animals running loose in Florida. This includes everything from capybaras:

To boa constrictors:

I assure you, all of the above pictures were taken of wild Floridian animals. You see, Florida has become a rather bonkers melting pot of exotic invasive species. Among them are American bison:

Four species of monkey (which also have herpes, but that’s a story for another day):

White-nosed coatis, raccoon relatives native to Central America:

Nile monitors, huge lizards usually found in Africa:

And even five species of constrictor snake - yellow anacondas, boa constrictors, African rock pythons (the world’s 4th biggest snake), Burmese pythons (2nd biggest in the world), and yes, green anacondas (the biggest of all).

Again, as far as I could tell all of the above pictures were taken in Florida. The moral of the story; it’s not only the people of Florida that are weird - the wildlife is too.
