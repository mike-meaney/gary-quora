I suppose “famous” and “history” can be somewhat subjective terms, but there have certainly been man-eating lions in Asia. The most prominent case is probably one which occurred in the summer of 2016.

Asiatics lions only exist in the wild in the Gir Forest, a national park in Gujarat, India. It was here that one killed three people, including a 14 year-old boy. After the attacks, rangers rounded up 17 lions which they suspected, and essentially put them on trial.

Each lion’s faeces, behaviour and footprints was examined, while they were caged. Eventually, 3 of the lions were found guilty - one male for making the kill, and two females for eating human remains. They were sent to live out the rest of their lives in zoos, while the 14 innocents were released back into the wild.

There have been plenty of other killings by Gir lions; the most recent one, I believe, was only a year ago. What’s more, it’s reasonable to expect that attacks will only grow more frequent. The lion population is thriving, meaning that the national park can no longer sustain all of the prides.

As more and more Asiatic lions are pushed out of the protected area, more and more of them will come into contact with humans. To avoid further deaths, something will need to be done about this exodus.
