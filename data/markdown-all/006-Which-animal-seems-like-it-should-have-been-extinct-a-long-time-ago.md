The giant panda. Tireless panda conservation efforts are beginning to work their magic on the species’ population, but it can’t be denied that the bear doesn’t do itself any favours when it comes to not going extinct.

Firstly, it has a highly specialized diet, effectively consuming only bamboo, a food source which is mostly just tough cellulose and offers very little in the way of energy, protein or other nutrients. To get its daily calories in, a panda bear must eat up to 14 kg of bamboo, so it spends most of its waking hours feeding (and the remainder defecating, which it has to do around 40 times a day).

And despite all the food they eat, pandas have still had to make compromises in order to be as calorie-efficient as possible. They are slow and sedentary, typically avoiding physical exertion of any sort, and have a similarly slow metabolic rate.

The funniest part about all this is that bamboo can be a perfectly viable dietary staple - countless large animals get by eating only grass, for example, which is similarly low in calories. However, the panda digestive system is terrible at processing plant matter - they still have the intestines typical of their recent carnivorous ancestors.

The gut is very straight and short, so the bamboo passes right through their system before it’s had a chance to be properly digested. Grazing animals typically have huge, convoluted intestinal tracts, as well as, in some cases, numerous stomachs. The longer the food is in there, the more nutrients you can extract from it.

One unique thing about many bamboo species, especially those found in China, is that they exhibit a behaviour called gregarious flowering - that is, all bamboo plants from a given species will flower, die and regrow simultaneously. This has led to some interesting ([and devastating](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-little-known-connections-between-historical-events-that-seem-to-have-nothing-to-do-with-each-other/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")) historical phenomena, but it also poses a problem for the pandas.

Because all the bamboo shoots of one species in the area might die at once, giant pandas can only live in regions where there are multiple varieties available, as an insurance policy. This is a further restriction inflicted on them by their bizarrely specialized diet.

And all this isn’t even mentioning their improbable reproductive biology. In the wild, a female will only be receptive to potential mates for a period of 2–3 days once every year. In captivity, as you may have heard, they are even less likely to breed, and some zoos have had resort to using Viagra and, believe it or not, panda pornography to get them in the mood.

I’m sure that was the last two-word phrase you wanted to hear on a Sunday evening, so perhaps it’s best to finish up now. Some creationists have pointed to these biological quirks as evidence of intelligent design (seems like pretty unintelligent design to me), which is of course unreasonable. If anything, pandas are a demonstration that survival and thus evolution isn’t about being perfect, it’s about being good enough.
