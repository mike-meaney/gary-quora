I would love to see a Carcharocles megalodon, a mosasaur, a eurypterid or a Livyatan alive and well in the oceans as much as the next guy, but ultimately, making up for our ignorant mistakes comes first. As such, I would choose one of these species, shown along with the date of their last credible sighting;

All of these were wiped out by human activity, and it’s only fair that - given the chance - we should bring at least one of them back.
