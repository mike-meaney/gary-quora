Just joking.

Well, a black panther is essentially a melanistic form of either a jaguar or a leopard.

Usually the only thing that’s gonna hurt a jaguar in the wild is another jaguar. So, when jaguars fight, it looks like this:

They face each other, never letting their opponent catch them off guard, and snarl. If the fight gets serious, one of them may launch itself at its enemy, swiping with its claws. Usually, jaguar fights only last about 3 seconds or less, but serious injury can be sustained.

A black panther would basically do the same, because their behavior is the same as the jaguar.

Leopards fight in a slightly different way, more offense than defense.

Leopard fights usually contain a lot of rolling, slashing and brawling, and can be fatal. However, unlike the jaguar, leopards aren’t top dog where they reign, so they face more threats.

Lions, hyenas, wild dogs and sometimes even cheetahs will contest leopards for their food, as you can see in this spectacular image from National Geographic’s Savage Kingdom.

When faced by a more powerful predator, leopards will usually back down. A single female hyena could overpower a fully grown male leopard, so its best to hide or flee in cases like those. Sometimes, if the leopard’s fighting a less overpowered predator, they will engage, like this one fighting a cheetah:

Again, a black leopard would probably fight in the same way as a normal one.

Thanks for asking me!
