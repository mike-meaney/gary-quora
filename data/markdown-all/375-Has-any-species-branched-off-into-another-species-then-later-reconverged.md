This has indeed happened, and in more ways than one.

There is a phenomenon known as parallel evolution, in which two groups of species which share a recent common ancestor evolve similar characteristics, due to similar environmental conditions. This isn’t to be confused with convergent evolution, which is when the two species are unrelated.

The go-to example of parallel evolution is that which has occurred in marsupial and placental mammals. They both descend from an early mammalian ancestor, and having evolved in isolation, they nevertheless took on strikingly similar forms.

Another example would be cichlid fish in the great lakes of Africa’s Rift Valley. Each of these lakes were once colonized by a single cichlid species, which quickly radiated into myriad new ones, all of them endemic to the lake they inhabited. Despite this, if you compare the different lakes’ fish, you can see that they sometimes evolve in much the same way.

However, in parallel evolution, the results are entirely separate species which happen to look very similar. In this way, they haven’t really “reconverged”, at least not in a genetic sense. For such an actual merger to happen, you’d need the two species to mate and produce a hybrid.

Of course, this isn’t unheard of in nature - there are a lot of species which form hybrids. Many of the big cats can interbreed, most famously lions and tigers, which thus birth ‘ligers’ and ‘tigons’.

That being said, ligers - like most interspecies hybrids - are sterile. A species is typically defined as a group of organisms which regularly reproduce with each other but not with other organisms. [There are a lot of problems with this definition](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-difficulties-in-defining-species/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"), as I’ve discussed in previous answers, but it’ll do for our purposes.

So, ligers are not in themselves species. Hybrid offspring forming species of their own is very rare - but again, not unheard of. Known as despeciation, a notable example would be Holarctic and Californian ravens in the Western US, which have been interbreeding for quite some time. The result: an entirely new species.

So, to answer your question; certainly. Not only can species evolve to look similar, they can hybridize, and even occasionally produce a merged species in so doing. Thanks for reading, have a nice day.

Edit: As [AngryApe - DEACTIVATED](https://www.quora.com/profile/AngryApe-DEACTIVATED "www.quora.com") pointed out, ligers aren't technically sterile — males usually are, but most females are fertile. Because of this, ligresses can mate with purebred lions and tigers, but not male ligers. Nevertheless, they still wouldn't be considered a species in themselves as they cannot reproduce with each other.
