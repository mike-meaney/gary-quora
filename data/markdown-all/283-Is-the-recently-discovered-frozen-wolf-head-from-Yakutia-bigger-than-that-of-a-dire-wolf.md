Alright, so the head is approximately 40 centimetres long, as you probably know (modern gray wolves are typically in the 22–27 range, for comparison).

Whereas this is from Wikipedia’s page on dire wolves:

> The skull length could reach up to 310 mm (12 in) or longer

Now, before you call me out on the fact that there’s a bit of neck on the Yakutian wolf head as well, it seems that people have accounted for that. According to this photo:

The tape hits 40 centimetres about where the external occipital protuberance would be.

Anyway, assuming Wikipedia is correct - and I found an academic source supporting it ([The Fauna of Rancho La Brea](https://archive.org/stream/faunaofrancholab02merr/faunaofrancholab02merr_djvu.txt "archive.org")) - it would appear that the head of the Yakutian wolf is significantly larger than the head of a typical dire wolf.
