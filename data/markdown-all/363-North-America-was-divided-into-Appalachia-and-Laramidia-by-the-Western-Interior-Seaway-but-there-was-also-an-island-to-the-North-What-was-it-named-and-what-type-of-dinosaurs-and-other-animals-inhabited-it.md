## North America was divided into Appalachia and Laramidia by the Western Interior Seaway, but there was also an island to the North. What was it named and what type of dinosaurs and other animals inhabited it?

You mean this island?

As far as I know, it’s called Franklinia, although almost every map of Cretaceous North America leaves it nameless. In fact, I’ve searched a lot and it seems it’s only mentioned (in this context) twice on the whole internet; on Wikipedia:

> The Hudson Seaway had major impacts on climate and migration routes by dividing the eastern half of the continent into two (Appalachia and Franklinia).

(A few pages copied and pasted that though), and in the book Iowa’s Geological Past: Three Billion Years of Change:

> Less rugged land areas (Appalachia and Franklinia) were located in the eastern and northern parts of the continent.

As for what fossil organisms were found there while it was an island, well… according to the Paleobiology Database, barely anything. Mainly diatoms - microscopic algae with silicate skeletons. Aside from them, there were a couple of plants, some kind of hadrosaur, and a bird or two.

The one interesting fossil find I found from that time and place was Canadaga arctica, a hesperornithine nearly as long as a man is tall.

For those who don’t know, hesperornithines were marine bird-relatives which lived in the Cretaceous. Like penguins, they were powerful swimmers, but flightless and ungainly on land. Canadaga arctica was in fact the largest hesperornithean, it turns out, probably due to [Bergmann's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergmann%27s_rule "en.wikipedia.org").
