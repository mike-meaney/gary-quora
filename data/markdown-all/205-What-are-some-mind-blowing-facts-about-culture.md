This question is brutally difficult to answer, because there are so many cultures in the world and so many of them are amazingly fascinating and unique. So, I’ll try my best to narrow it down a top ten, in no particular order. Enjoy!

*   The Himba. This semi-nomadic tribe, found in the deserts of northern Namibia, numbers about 50,000. The women wear goat leather crowns (Erembe) and cover their skin and hair with otzije, a reddish mixture of milk fat and ochre, which cleanses the skin and protects from the heat. It also gives their hair a bizarre, tentacle-like appearance. Their diet consists almost entirely of porridge and women are forbidden to wash with water (as it’s scarce) so they must use smoke from charcoals instead.

*   The Sentinelese of the tiny North Sentinel Island (in the Andamans). There may be as little as 50 of them, and they are, in many ways, still in the Stone Age. They live almost naked (although the jawbones of deceased ancestors are sometimes worn) as hunter-gatherers, and have been isolated from other peoples for as much as 60,000 years. Notoriously, they are extremely hostile to outsiders, riddling helicopters with spears and killing an idiotic missionary in 2018. There has only been one peaceful contact in history.

*   The Dogon, which inhabit parts of Mali and Burkina Faso. Their population is centered around an enormous cliff of sandstone which stretches for some 150 kilometres, known as the Bandiagara Escarpment. In the shelter of this cliff, the Dogon build exquisite mud villages, and the language they speak represents a wholly unique branch of the Niger-Congo language family. They’re also known for their beautiful wooden masks, dances, and mysteriously sophisticated knowledge of the cosmos.

*   The Ainu people of Hokkaido and the Russian Far East. In Japan, where the best part of them live, their culture was sadly suppressed following the Meiji Restoration as they were assimilated into mainland Japanese culture. These traditions, though much more uncommon today, are fascinating. Traditionally Ainu live as hunter-gatherers in reed huts, and worship nature gods (the bear is especially revered). Genetically, they are not closely related to any modern ethnic group.

*   Papua New Guinea’s Chambri people. They are chiefly a fishing and bartering people, living on islands in the Sepik River. They’re known for their unusual gender roles, in which neither the women nor the men are dominant. They also revere the river’s crocodiles, holding festivals in their honour. To come of age, the boys must undergo a grotesque rite of passage where their back and chest are scarified (without anaesthetic) so that they are covered in “crocodile scales”.

*   An unmissable choice - the Kazakhs. Most of what I say here is also true of their cousins the Kyrgyz, which have a very similar culture and could be substituted on this list. Traditional Kazakhs are nomadic herders and hunters which roam the Eurasian steppe. Perhaps most fascinatingly of all, many Kazakhs in Mongolia still practice the ancient tradition of hunting with trained eagles and other birds of prey.

*   In Pakistan’s fertile Chitral Valley, you can find the unique Kalash people. Unlike most Pakistanis, the Kalash traditionally follow a polytheistic religion which has similarities to ancient forms of Hinduism. The women wear vibrant dresses, and there are many colourful and bizarre festivals (one involves sending a young boy to live with goats for a summer). Some speculate that they are of European descent, but genetic evidence shows that they’re 100% South Asians, albeit quite unique.

*   Our first culture from the Americas - the Pirahã. This is an isolated hunter-gatherer people which dwells in the Amazon Rainforest. Their way of life is heavily based on direct, real-time experience - they keep no history and worship no deity. They have no formal leaders, do not preserve food, and they never make drawings. The Pirahã language is amazing, too - there are only 8 consonants and 3 vowels, and it’s spoken in whistles and hums. They have no words for colors or even numbers. Pirahã culture is human culture boiled down to its rawest, most natural form - simple but enough.

*   Another easy choice for this list - the Bajau. Sometimes referred to as “sea nomads”, these people of the Malay Archipelago traditionally live almost entirely at sea. They dwell in houseboats, small fleets of which travel from place to place, and construct stilted villages in shallow seas. Their cuisine consists chiefly of fish and other marine life. Strangest of all, they are genetically adapted to be exceptional freedivers - spending up to 5 hours daily underwater, they’re more resistant to hypoxia, more tolerant of CO2 in the blood, and store more haemoglobin than normal humans.

*   Finally, a broader group from India - the Naga people. This is an umbrella term for a variety of tribes found in Northeast India’s Seven Sisters and parts of neighbouring Myanmar. They’re diverse, but nevertheless similar in terms of culture. The Naga people often adorn themselves with colourful jewelry (including tusks, shell, bone and much more), and they speak nearly 90 different languages. They’re also some of the last people India which still practice entomophagy; the eating of insects.

So, those are the ten ethnic groups whose cultures I find most interesting. There were certainly others which I came close to being included - the Yakuts, the Quechuas, and various peoples from Oceania, for example - but I decided to keep it to these ten.

Also note that in this answer, I talk about the traditional lifestyles of these people. For most if not all of them, many individuals live a more modern, conventional life - sometimes the majority, in fact. The sad truth is that tribes like these are usually assimilated by the region’s dominant culture.

Anywho, thanks for reading, I hope you learned some new things, have a nice day.
