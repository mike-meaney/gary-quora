Basically, before placentals evolved, monotremes and marsupials were found all over the world. When Placentalia did appear, their much shorter gestation periods, among other things, led them to out-compete the other mammals, but they couldnâ€™t spread to Australia before it broke off from the mainland. Its isolation has made it tricky for placentals to get there even today, so marsupials dominate while monotremes cling on.

By the way, not all marsupials live in Australia, as some have managed to scrape a niche out in the Americas, like the opossum.
