A lot of cities sprung to mind at first, but I think the winner has to be Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. Home to around a million people, it’s situated on the fringes of the Karakum Desert’s sprawling sands, in the western region of this strange Central Asian country.

Though it appears pristine and luxurious, most of its citizens live behind the scenes in much poorer conditions. Though it has a million residents, it’s often jokingly called the “City of the Dead”.

Its wide, green boulevards are usually barren, and the scant cars you’ll see are all white - other colours are banned.

The buildings are built entirely out of gleaming white marble. Most of the apartment blocks you’ll see are essentially hollow inside, with no actual accommodation. It’s a shiny facade to convey prosperity and beauty.

Many of the landmarks are bizarre, too, with impressive geometry. Eight pointed stars are a common motif, as they are a symbol of Oguz Khagan, a legendary Turkic ruler.

They’re no stranger to outlandish scale, either. Turkmenistan Tower, a TV and communications mast, is the tallest structure in the country at 211 metres, and features the world’s largest architectural star shape.

Ashgabat Fountain has a greater number of fountain pools than anywhere else on Earth.

Ashgabat Flagpole was the tallest flagpole in the world until 2010, and it’s since been moved down to fifth place. It’s 133 metres tall.

The Alem Cultural Centre features the world’s largest indoor ferris wheel, which is encased in glass and white steel.

In the Turkmen Carpet Museum, you can find massive hand-made carpets, one of which measures 21 metres by 14 metres.

There’s even a giant model of the Ruhnama, a controversial book written by a past dictator of Turkmenistan.

As you can see, Ashgabat is a bizarre capital for a bizarre country. It’s a place where black cars, dogs, lip-syncing, car radio, ballet, circuses, video games, growing a beard, wearing makeup and smoking in public are all illegal.

Now, for some runner up capitals, which are interesting, but not this interesting. There’s Pyongyang, North Korea, a city of propaganda which has much in common with Ashgabat.

Naypyidaw, the planned-from-scratch capital of Myanmar, is over sixty times the size of Paris, area-wise, but has less than half the population. It has struggled to attract Burmese to move over and remains a “Ghost City”.

Nairobi, Kenya, a surprisingly modern metropolis which has its own wildlife-rich national park, unlike any other city in the world. I’ve visited Nairobi quite a few times and love its African charm.

Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, a futuristic city which seems to rise abruptly out of the empty steppe. Like Ashgabat, it owes its glamorous architecture to money from oil and gas reserves.

Malabo, Equatorial Guinea’s capital, which is unique because of its location. Rather than being on the country’s mainland, it’s situated on a small island around 230 kilometres away.

So, that’s been Ashgabat, and my five honourable mentions. I hope you’ve enjoyed, thank you all for reading.
