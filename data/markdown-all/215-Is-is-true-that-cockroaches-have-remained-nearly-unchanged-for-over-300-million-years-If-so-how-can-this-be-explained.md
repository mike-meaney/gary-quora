## Is is true that cockroaches have remained nearly unchanged for over 300 million years? If so, how can this be explained?

No - they haven’t even existed for half that long. It’s a widely believed myth that cockroaches (as in Blattodeans) originated in the Carboniferous period, roughly 300 million years ago, but that has been debunked - see here; [FC-10](https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/fc-10 "palaeo-electronica.org").

Reconstructed above is Cretaholocompsa montsecana, the earliest known fossil cockroach, which is only about 120 million years old, 130 at most. And even since then, cockroaches have done a lot of evolving. This, for example, is Manipulator modificaputis, a cockroach which lived in Burma 100 million years ago:

This insect had a long neck and legs, a freely rotating head, and - strangest of all - raptorial forelimbs, just like a modern mantis. Despite being completely unrelated to mantoids, this cockroach evolved a similar predatory lifestyle and anatomy.

And it’s not even necessary to look into the fossil record to see that some cockroaches have undergone much evolutionary change. Genetic studies have confirmed that termites are in fact a kind of cockroach, belonging to the suborder Isoptera, within the cockroach order Blattodea.

Physically, termites are worlds apart from conventional cockroaches - in most cases, they’re tiny, wingless, eyeless, and above all eusocial, which is a huge difference. In short, even in the 120–30 million years they’ve been around, cockroaches have changed a lot.
