Interesting question. I suppose an obvious choice would be San Diego; most notably it has the San Diego Zoo, which is arguably the the best zoo worldwide. It’s also the most visited one in the Western Hemisphere and contains some 800 animal species.

Also in this city, you can see SeaWorld San Diego, which I’m not a big fan of personally but is nevertheless a very popular tourist attraction;

And, if you stretch the definition of “zoo” a bit, there’s the Birch Aquarium.

Additionally you could point to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, which isn’t actually in the city itself. Since it’s in San Diego county, I think it should be included here too.

So that puts San Diego at four major “zoos”, some of which are world class. However, it’s hard to say if it’s a clear winner.

Across the Atlantic, for example, there’s Berlin. The German capital has not one, but two zoos that are more species-rich than San Diego Zoo. The smaller of the two is the Tierpark Berlin, with 846 species:

While the bigger and most famous is of course the Berlin Zoological Garden. It holds quite a few records - the oldest German zoo, the most popular European zoo, and the zoo with the largest collection of species worldwide. Here you can see a staggering 1,380 different animal species.

If we include aquariums like we did for San Diego, there’s also the Aquarium Berlin, which has 800 species contained in some 25,000 litres of water.

There’s one more city which I think could definitely rival both of the aforementioned ones - Singapore. Here, one can visit the Singapore Zoo, which, while not as popular as Berlin or San Diego, is a consistent candidate in discussions on the world’s best zoo.

Nearby, there’s what’s known as the Night Safari - the world’s first nocturnal zoo. Only open at night, it gets nearly as many visitors as the main Singapore Zoo and houses around 100 species.

Then there’s yet another zoo, called the River Safari. This river-themed attraction features the world’s largest freshwater aquarium and a boat ride based on the Amazon River.

Believe it or not, Singapore has a fourth zoo, too - the Jurong Bird Park. It boasts one of the world’s largest aviaries, one of the tallest indoor waterfalls, and a collection of half a thousand different bird species.

Again, if we include aquariums, then I’d have to mention the S.E.A Aquarium in Singapore. The second largest aquarium in the entire world, its 45 million litres of water house an incredible 100,000 animals, some of which are extremely rare in captivity.

So, those are three cities - one in North America, one in Europe, and one in Asia. You could make a case for any of them as the best city for zoos, but for me I think Singapore is the winner, as it’s got four world-class zoos and a record-breaking aquarium - both quantity and quality. That being said, I haven’t been there myself.

If you have any other suggestions which I didn’t include in this answer feel free to let me know.
