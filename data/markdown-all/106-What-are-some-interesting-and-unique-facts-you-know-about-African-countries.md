Alright, I’ll do this in alphabetical order.

*   Algeria: The Sahara Desert engulfs about 90% of Africa’s largest country. Last year in January, the Algerian Sahara experienced snowfall, something that has only happened to the world’s largest hot desert 3 times in the past 40 years.

*   Angola: In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, part of Angola was ruled by a nation-state called the Kingdom of Ndongo, also known as Dongo. The king or queen of Ndongo was called an ngola \- hence the country’s modern name.

*   Benin: In Benin, it is considered bad etiquette to eat with your left hand, or worse still, give a handshake with your left hand.

*   Botswana: Botswana is home to the Okavango Delta, the largest inland delta in the world. The Okavango river doesn’t flow into a sea or lake, it just peters out in the middle of the land. The delta has an area of 15,000 square kilometres and some 150,000 islands.

*   Burundi: The Ruzizi River of Burundi is the haunt of the infamous Gustave. Gustave could be the world’s largest Nile crocodile, and the deaths of over 300 people have been attributed to him. He’s also survived direct gunfire and allegedly kills and eats fully grown hippos. He was the inspiration for the (mediocre) 2007 film Primeval.

*   Cape Verde: This often-forgotten archipelago was the first-ever tropical European settlement, as it was colonized by the Portuguese in 1462. It went on to become an important stop for sailors on long voyages and both Columbus and Elcano (Magellan’s successor) resupplied there.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-586dc4158f7321485424e290c7a3a52a-lq)

*   Cameroon: Cameroon is the primary home of the aptly named goliath frog, the largest frog in the world. About a foot long, the adults have been known to eat very large prey like other frogs, turtles, snakes and even bats.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-973164d910e24391d830ce2f8bf09e07-lq)

*   Central African Republic: The CAR is the possible hideout of Joseph Kony, one of the world’s most wanted men. The warlord and his supporters - who believe him to have mystical powers - have led a brutal 26-year campaign to overthrow the Ugandan government, committing unspeakable atrocities along the way.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2f17be6f64e94c34fdd0473f1f41b9f2-lq)

*   Chad: Thousands of years ago in the African Humid Period, the Sahara was green, and Lake Chad was probably the largest lake in the world. At over 402,000 square kilometers in area, it would have outsized the Caspian Sea and made its modern equivalent look like a pond.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f7d111c5ea88bab91bbe694b1fa412b7-pjlq)

*   Comoros: Comoros is home to the main population of West Indian coelacanths. In 1938, a trawler first turned up one of these strange fish, and it was later identified as a coelacanth - a type of animal which was thought to have gone extinct hundreds of millions of years ago! The discovery shocked the world.

*   Congo Republic: Here you can find Diosso Gorge, also known as the “Grand Canyon of the Congo” because of its spectacular red cliffs. Despite its natural beauty, the country’s director of environment once approved the dumping of 1 million tons of toxic waste into the gorge.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dfe536f7974ee5d67fce13e678b0571e-lq)

*   Cote d’Ivoire: In this nation’s capital, Yamoussoukro, you’ll find the world’s largest church, the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace. It was completed in 1989, and estimates say it may have costed up to 600 million US dollars.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-04879f0a5b7b2a0eac3e72dbf9467f3d-lq)

*   Djibouti: The lake of Lac Assal, Djibouti, is the second-saltiest water body in the world, after a pond in Antarctica. 10 times saltier than the ocean, the waters are so saline that they are devoid of any aquatic fauna whatsoever.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-88236da363f4bdaa70c043a693d6f613-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ee97c4809ed244cf08c16e7f12ba946f-lq)

*   Equatorial Guinea: The capital of Equatorial Guinea is Malabo, situated on an offshore island - making it one of the only countries with a capital not on the mainland. However, a new capital, Oyala, is under construction, set to be complete by 2020.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-06488b10a8d432737591fadd1bd2eaa4-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f89c5b3b2b848678dc4dc23bf3df4015-lq)

*   eSwatini: Never heard of this one? That’s because, until 2018, it was known as Swaziland. It was renamed eSwatini, meaning “land of the Swazis”, by King Mswati III, pictured below. He’s allowed to do that because he’s one of the world’s very few absolute monarchs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4bb79fcb97762d5a279a2206ed1b5e0a-lq)

*   Ethiopia: Though it’s very controversial, some say Ethiopia was never colonized by Europeans. In the famous Battle of Adwa, an Italian colonial army of less than 18,000 was met by an Ethiopian force of 100,000 soldiers, many of them wielding swords and spears. And the Africans won.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-084b052a6055a70ebfb72532a10d1221-lq)

*   Gabon: This is one of the most promising African countries for wildlife conservation, as it is fairly prosperous, politically stable and biodiverse. Of the nation’s rainforests, which make up 85% of its area, a whole 11% is dedicated to natural parks and wildlife reservations.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3e07766a7f0676e3a2345781169dabdb-lq)

*   The Gambia: The highest point in all of the Gambia is the aptly named Red Rock - which is a measly 53 metres above sea level! I couldn’t find any good pictures, but from what I’ve read… yeah, it’s basically just a red rock. Here’s a random picture of Gambia instead.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-50b21edb9ed9cdc7d26dd32fbbc14ed3-lq)

*   Ghana: The Akan people of Ghana often name their children after the day of the week they were born on. Similar to a horoscope, the day of birth is also thought to influence the child’s future personality and profession.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c2e9a3712bbb73cfdd9bc7da668901ab-lq)

*   Guinea: Despite being rather small for a country (though as an Irishman I can’t say much), roughly a quarter of all the known bauxite in the world is found in Guinea. Bauxite is a reddish rock and the world’s main source of aluminium, and is mined on a huge scale in Guinea.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b3add497ee7c4b933e6dae5925cbc9df-lq)

*   Guinea-Bissau: Unfortunately, despite once being hailed as a potential model for development, this is one of the poorest countries in the world. In a typical sample of 1,000 Bissau-Guineans, 15 have Internet access, 8 have a landline and only 1 has a mobile phone.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d724ec887f81e7d8015ff88aa2b0597f-lq)

*   Kenya: Some of the earliest human remains known have been found in Kenya, leading some to hypothesize that humans first evolved in what is now this country or near it. As a result, the region is nicknamed the “Cradle of Humanity”.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-54d0b79dd9202baf3b47a9eb75104a91-lq)

*   Lesotho: This is the only country in the world situated entirely over 1,000 metres above sea level, and one of two where the average altitude is more than 2,000 metres. Hence, it’s often referred to as the Kingdom of the Sky.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9d6195a6b98298927894467c0cc0672f-pjlq)

*   Liberia: This nation was founded and created exclusively for the purpose of being a place where freed African-American slaves could migrate to and live. Its first ever president, Joseph Jenkins Roberts, was a former slave from Virginia.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d0423f2f7a4488967d12e93122a85a96-lq)

*   Libya: Overall, Libya is perhaps the driest and hottest country in the whole world. Its average annual precipitation is 55 millimeters - compare that to the USA’s 1,035. Sometimes, here, a drop of rain doesn’t fall for decades at a time.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f0bbdaa7391a5b1768a6efa73342fcb0.webp)

*   Madagascar: Excluding Antarctica, Madagascar was the second-last significant landmass to be reached by humans - it was only settled at around 500 AD. And despite it being less than 400 km off the African coast, African colonists were beaten to the island by Austronesians from across the Indian Ocean!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-47ec2cc9632c35750d2427fde671526b.webp)

*   Malawi: Lake Malawi is Africa’s third largest and second deepest lake, and has more fish species than any lake in the world, at an estimated 1,000. In the rainy season, millions of midges hatch beneath the surface and emerge, forming impossibly huge swarms like plumes of smoke. This is, in fact, the largest gathering of animals on Earth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6e538342a50c1e4b3d1523a22952e51e-lq)

*   Mali: The Bandiagara Escarpment, Mali, is a huge sandstone cliff dotted with Dogon villages of cliff-dwellings. While the architecture is very impressive, it is extremely inadvisable to visit as violence occurs there on a daily basis.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e92f2a562cf8458773266ce2579a9861-lq)

*   Mauritius: The famous dodo bird of Mauritius is usually depicted as a plump, awkward bird with dull grey plumage. However, a 1625 painting by Ustad Mansur, famed for his accuracy, confirms that it was slimmer and more elegant than we thought, with a rich brown and gold colour scheme.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bbe3b9c8a0875a9e0878eaf36ef48cab-lq)

*   Morocco: The Ouarzazate Solar Power Station, Morocco, is the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world. When finished, it will produce 582 megawatts, saving us from over 700,000 megatons of CO2, and have cost an expected $9 billion.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-09e3edd8dd0e944a5dbb1029df1c8770-lq)

*   Mozambique: Mozambique’s Gorongosa was once a national park rich in wildlife - however, in the ‘80s, the area was ravaged by brutal civil war and turned into a wasteland. But thanks to a $10 million, 8-year restoration effort, it is once more a thriving ecosystem of spectacular fauna.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d27c707f25e7597d9defaf1f451e40ca-lq)

*   Namibia: In Namibia’s Namib Desert (the oldest desert in the world, having been around for 80 million years) you can find the tallest dune in the world, known as Big Daddy. Big Daddy is indeed big, as it’s a staggering 325 meters tall. It faces another large dune, appropriately named Big Mama.

*   Nigeria: Nigeria has its own film industry, known as “Nollywood”, which produces an impressive ~10,000 films every year. Nollywood films are famously cheesy and often repeat clichés. They’ve also been the source of a few memes well-known in the Western World…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-66c36e7e41b7a0ecda9f7d3f0ec08307-lq)

*   Rwanda: The Rwandan capital, Kigali, is hailed as Africa’s cleanest city. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on reducing traffic, improving services and cleaning up waste, and the head of the UN Environment Program went so far as to call it the “cleanest city on the planet”.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a065f5bc7298f230358b84c5d7b78c2d-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-324128f1d4698a67ab8089813b4b6705-lq)

*   Senegal: The world’s largest collection of megalithic structures is in Senegal - the Senegambian Stone Circles. Covering an area of 30,000 square kilometres, there are some 29,000 pillar-like stones forming a total of 17,000 rings, built by some mysterious ancient civilization.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6f5a043115d32d59d3851a378ba01564-lq)

*   South Africa: What do you think of when you hear “African wildlife”? Penguins? I doubt it. However, many South African beaches are home to colonies of African penguins, unique to SA and Namibia. Chances are you’ve seen an African penguin, too, as they’re very popular with zoos.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e88b39f4684c4b087d8357fe304148bf-lq)

*   Sudan: At 350, Sudan has well over twice as many pyramids as Egypt does - only its were not built by the ancient Egyptians. Rather, they were the work of Nubia, an early African civilization which had mixed relations with Egypt.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8b567b8a149f6e3c1a8dad906d41a3d9.webp)

*   Tanzania: The Tanzania-Kenya border, which is otherwise fairly straight, swerves unusually so that Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania. This is because of a 19th Century agreement between Britain and Germany - British Kenya got the port of Mombasa, while German Tanganyika got the mountain.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9d322c3822f4d367218077a6f4ea8d00-lq)

*   Togo: In 2005, the Togolese president died and a man called Fambare Natchaba was supposed to take his place - however, he was out of the country at the time.
