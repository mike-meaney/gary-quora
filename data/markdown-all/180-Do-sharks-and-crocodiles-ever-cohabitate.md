## Do sharks and crocodiles ever cohabitate?

For sure. Both types of animals are spread widely across the world, especially in more equatorial latitudes, and there are environments where they might indeed encounter one another. Usually, these direct interactions end in one predator being eaten by the other.

Out of all the crocodilian species, saltwater crocodiles are most famous for their interactions with sharks - unsurprisingly, given their seagoing habits. In Australia’s Northern Territory, there are quite a few accounts of salties eating bull sharks (usually smaller ones).

It’s thought that their presence in tidal estuaries might even prevent bull sharks from migrating further inland, as the latter can survive in freshwater too.

The saltwater croc pictured above, nicknamed Brutus, is a famous resident of the Adelaide River, in Kakadu National Park. He actually lost his right foreleg in a run-in with a different shark, of unknown species.

Brutus was estimated at being around 80 years old in 2014 (when the first pic was taken), so I’m not sure if he’s still alive, as that’s already quite a bit older than these crocs typically get.

In addition to many instances of them feeding on bull sharks, saltwater crocodiles have been spotted swimming amongst lemon sharks:

And scavenging humpback whale carcasses alongside tiger sharks:

A couple of years ago, someone caught some [excellent footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=827SIrm_F0w "www.youtube.com") of a shark (a thresher shark I think? Maybe a lemon shark or leopard shark) tailing a saltie. I’ve also heard about an instance of a saltwater crocodile eating a very large, 4 metre long tiger shark, but it’s not a well-documented case.

There’s also this saltwater which caught itself a huge sawfish. Technically that’s a ray, not a shark, but it’s a cool photo so I thought I’d share it here.

The second-largest reptile, the Nile crocodile of Africa, also seems to tangle with sharks sometimes, despite it being a freshwater species. Just this year, a croc in South Africa was photographed snapping up a young bull shark in spectacular fashion:

Also, back in 2013, a Nile crocodile in St. Lucia (also in South Africa) was found decapitated on a beach. It was thought that the only culprit behind such a devastating cut could be a great white shark, but it was later proven to have likely been a boat propeller.

However, crocs from that area, St. Lucia, have been found with bull shark, sand tiger shark, and ragged-tooth shark remains in their stomachs. There was even a 1982 observation of a large group of crocodiles there going head-to-head with around six sand tiger sharks.

Now that would be quite a sight.

Anyway, there’s also the lesser-known American crocodile, which ranges across much of Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, as well as parts of Florida and South America.

In Colombia, young American crocs reportedly fall prey to great white sharks. That being said, the sharks don’t always have the upper hand with this species.

Fascinatingly, lemon sharks seem to recognize and avoid the chemical odour of American crocodiles, and a similar response has been noted in bull sharks. In 2001 the US Navy actually investigated this while researching possible shark repellents. They found:

> Lemon sharks, especially juveniles, inherently recognize chemical exudates produced by the American crocodile . . . . Further, they demonstrated that the lemon shark . . . shows aversive responses to 3 identified crocodile exudates . . . produced most likely from the crocodile’s chin gland, feces and blood.

So, those are all the most interesting events of shark-crocodile interaction I could find. That is, however, excluding those between sharks and American alligators, of which there are plenty. These gators are known to eat lemon sharks, nurse sharks and bonnetheads.

And, believe it or not, in 1877 there was allegedly a showdown between hundreds (each) of alligators and sharks off the coast of Florida. In the subsequent days, many carcasses of both species were found on nearby shores. They had aggregated there in such massive numbers due to a trapped shoal of fish in a tidal inlet.

Lastly, I’ll briefly mention that mugger crocodiles have been noted fighting sharks, and freshwater crocodiles seem to fall prey to a variety of shark species. There are really a lot more incidents I could go into, but if I did we’d be here all day, so everything above represents the most noteworthy.

Thank you very much for reading, and have a great day.
