Consider our good friend Ken Ham, and his Ark Encounter.

To build his Ark, which is allegedly accurate in size (even though the Bible measures the Ark’s length in cubits, which is an ancient unit of measurement whose value is subjective and prone to change), he enlisted over 1,000 workers.

It took these workers about 4 years (2012–2016) to build this thing, meaning that it took about 4,000 man years of labor to build, with modern technology, including several heavylift cranes. So, if Noah and seven other people in his family were to get the Ark done before 4,400 BC, they would have to start building the damn thing 1,000 years earlier (Not long after the beginning of universe in Ham’s eyes), even if they had cranes, drills, nails, trucks and the like.

And, despite him having 100 million dollars, 1,000 workers, and state of the art equipment, Ken had to build a massive building on one side to keep the “boat” standing, and as you can see at the start of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ln2epbcEao "www.youtube.com"), its woodwork starts to warp during heavy rainfall (not ideal in an apocalyptic flood).

Furthermore, have a look at this size chart:

Yes, Ham’s Ark is larger than the largest wooden ship of all time, which ended up being flexed apart by waves at sea, the planks buckling and the whole ship sinking. The Wyoming was built by the 20th century’s finest shipbuilders, but a family of 8 which lived at the same time as woolly mammoths could do what they could never manage?

One more thing; even with the Ark’s colossal size which neared that of the Titanic’s, this is how much space Ham could afford for the animals:

That kind of proximity, in addition to being incredibly damaging to the animal’s mental health, is equivalent to the proximity some caged cows are kept in; and the US has to spend 80% of its antibiotics on them just to keep them from dying of disease. Noah didn’t have any antibiotics at all, so all his animals would die on board.

None of this even mentions the ridiculous implausibility of the Genesis Flood; this is explained excellently in Aron Ra’s video series here: [How Aron Ra Disproves Noah's flood - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXJ4dsU0oGMJP95iZJqEjmc5oxY5r6BzP "www.youtube.com")

EDIT: Some more points I’ve since thought of. What about eusocial species? You can’t just bring along one male and female ant, or one male and female termite. That just doesn’t work. Speaking of termites, what was to stop them from eating away at the boat’s timbers?

And then there are semi-aquatic animals. A seal or a sea turtle could neither spend the whole voyage on the Ark nor the sea. Sea snakes spend their adult lives in the ocean, but have to lay their eggs on land.

Furthermore, there’s the problem of feeding the animals. Consider the predators - you’d need a full cow to sustain a single lion for a year, and that’s just one of the pair of one of the many species of large carnivores on our Earth. Then there are other species, like koalas (which eat only eucalyptus), myrmecophages like anteaters, pangolins, numbats, etc. (which eat only ants or termites), and snail kites (which eat only snails).

The Bible says that Noah’s Ark only had one window. In a few days, toxic fumes would build up - especially in the ridiculously cramped conditions you’d need to squash tens of thousands of animals, some bigger than sperm whales, into a 500-metre box. The animals would die, if disease, parasites, starvation or shipwreck hadn’t gotten to them first (which are all guaranteed to happen sooner or later).

I could go on, and on, and on about more reasons why this is a pathetically impossible fable, but this has gone on long enough.
