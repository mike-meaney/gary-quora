Maybe. I assume that by “Taiwanese leopard” you’re referring to the Formosan clouded leopard, Neofelis nebulosa brachyura, a subspecies of the mainland clouded leopard which formerly inhabited Taiwan.

In 2013, the Formosan clouded leopard was listed as extinct, on the basis that there have been no confirmed sightings since 1983 (although a skin was found in 1989). Extensive camera-trapping studies from 1997 to 2012 failed to detect it.

However, earlier this year, I believe that two sightings from the summer of 2018 were reported. To quote the original story from Taiwan News ([here](https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3644433 "www.taiwannews.com.tw")):

> Alangyi Village rangers recently spotted what they believed to be a Formosan clouded leopard hunting goats on a cliff in Taitung County's Daren Township.

and:

> Another team member described seeing a leopard darting past a scooter before scurrying up a tree and going out of sight.

When I heard the news back in February it was very exciting, and I sincerely hope the sightings were genuine. I guess they could have been misidentified leopard cats, although leopard cats don’t hunt goats.

Note that some experts hold that the Formosan clouded leopard never existed at all, since it was barely ever seen even before its alleged extinction. However, most dismiss this hypothesis, including myself.
