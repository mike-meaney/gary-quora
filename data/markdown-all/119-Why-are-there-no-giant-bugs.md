Many people would say it’s because there’s not currently enough oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain giant bugs. However, as I’ve explained in previous answers, the fossil record does not support that notion. Rather, it seems that what’s preventing arthropods from getting huge is competition.

The largest terrestrial arthropod in the world is the coconut crab. Where is it found? On small, isolated islands dotted across the Pacific and Indian Oceans. These islands are difficult for vertebrates to colonize; therefore, there’s an absence of competition and the crabs have filled the niche that mammals or reptiles would otherwise take.

The same trend is repeated all over the world, from the giant crayfish of Tasmania:

To New Zealand’s wetas, the world’s largest insects:

Vertebrates, today, are the world’s dominant large land animals, and their presence blocks other groups, such as arthropods, from fulfilling any such roles. If we look into the deep past, we see more evidence of this.

The Carboniferous is famous for its giant bugs, such as the large griffinfly Meganeura:

Moving forward in time, the Permian is similar, with even larger griffinflies like Meganeuropsis:

Even in the early Triassic, giant insects are still buzzing around, including the titanopterans:

And then they disappear. What does this coincide with? The advent of the pterosaurs, who took flight and outcompeted insects as the dominant large, flying animals. Ever since then, tetrapods - be they pterosaurs, birds or bats - have ruled the skies, preventing any invertebrates from evolving to take their place.

In short, insects and their relatives no longer grow to the sizes they once did because of the [principle of competitive exclusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_exclusion_principle "en.wikipedia.org"); you remove the vertebrates as islands do, and the arthropods may claim the role again.
