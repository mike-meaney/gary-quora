Ophidiophobia is something which has a genetic basis, and is deeply rooted in human, primate, and even mammal evolution as a whole. A 2001 paper - [Emotion drives attention: detecting the snake in the grass](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11561921 "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov") - found that images of snakes and spiders are identified much quicker by the human brain than those of random objects.

There is even a hypothesis, the Snake Detection Theory, that detecting serpents was a crucial factor in the evolution of us primates’ advanced trichromatic color vision; we have three color receptor cones whereas most mammals have two.

In this 2017 study - [Snake scales, partial exposure, and the Snake Detection Theory: A human event-related potentials study](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46331 "www.nature.com") - vervet monkeys and macaques were shown the above images. When shown the ones of snake scales, brain activity spiked.

There was also one anthropological study on a Philippine tribe called the Agta, which aimed to shed light on how ancient humans and snakes might have interacted. It found that about a quarter of Agta men had been attacked by pythons, with a traumatic python-related incident happening once every 2–3 years.

Perhaps the Agta are a special case, but I think it’s fair to say that snakes must have played a significant part in the lives of prehistoric hominins. With all this evidence in mind, it’s no wonder that he fear of snakes is the world’s most commonly reported phobia.
