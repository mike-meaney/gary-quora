## What was the apex predator in North America during the Permian period? Doing a preliminary Google search, it appears our fossil record missed out on having charismatic fauna like the therapsids in South Africa and Russia.

You could certainly do a lot worse…

Ctenospondylus

I could go on, but I won’t drag this on any longer.

Most of them are from the Red Beds in Utah - Southwestern America is actually well-known for its richness of Permian fossils, though most of them are in the Permian Basin, which was underwater during that time - so mainly just marine invertebrates.

This likely changed countless times over the course of the period, but it was probably some species of Sphenacodont the whole way through, at least on land.

This could include Dimetrodon, Ctenorhachis, Ctenospondylus, and Sphenacodon.
