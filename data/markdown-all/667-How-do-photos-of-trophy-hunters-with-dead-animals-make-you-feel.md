Positively disgusted would be the right way of putting it.

Here these people are - normal, civilized people in all respects - posing next to wild animals they killed, not under their own power and strength, but with a metal stick made by somebody else which they exchanged for money.

It is utterly perplexing how these people willingly know that they have killed free animals, which could not want anything less than death, by cheating and using something which their victims could not ever have, and then sit next to them with wicked, arrogant smiles on their faces.

When you think about it, trophy hunting is an utterly indefensible act of savagery which is only practiced by these people because they lack the intelligence to even think about what they are doing.
