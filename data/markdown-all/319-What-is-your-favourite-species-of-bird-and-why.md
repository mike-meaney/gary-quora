Well, I have a few.

*   You’ve probably heard of the harpy eagle. However, did you know it has a very close relative in Australasia? The Papuan harpy eagle of Papua New Guinea is the island’s top predator, hunting wallabies, tree kangaroos, phalangers and sometimes even [singing dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea_singing_dog "en.wikipedia.org").

*   While most hornbills have hollow casques which they use as resonating chambers to produce sound, those of helmeted hornbills are completely solid. This is because the birds use them as rams in airborne fights, as if they’re flying pachycephalosaurs. Sadly, helmeted hornbills are critically endangered, as they’re poached for their “red ivory”.

*   The giant ibis is, well, just that. Twice the size of any other ibis, they measure a meter in length and height, and weigh over four kilograms. Native to Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, they are very mysterious and poorly understood despite their size.

*   New Caledonia’s kagu is interesting because it’s so unique. It has these strange structures covering its nostrils called nasal corns, which prevent particles from getting into its nose as it probes the soil. No other bird species has this. Also, for unknown reasons, it has a two thirds less red blood cells than a typical bird.

*   Africa has many eagle species, but the largest and most powerful is the martial eagle. Able to take down gazelles and even the cubs of big cats, they have a very varied diet of roughly 150 animal species. I’ve seen them in the wild several times before, and nearly saw one hunting guineafowl.

Of course, I have many more favourites, but these are just a few which I find to be the most interesting or underrated.
