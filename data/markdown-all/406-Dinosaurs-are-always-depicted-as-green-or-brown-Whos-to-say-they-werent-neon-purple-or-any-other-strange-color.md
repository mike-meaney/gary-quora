## Dinosaurs are always depicted as green or brown. Who's to say they weren't neon purple or any other strange color?

You’ve already gotten a lot of answers, but I’m going to add one more.

One of my favourite books, All Yesterdays, portrays dinosaurs and other Mesozoic animals in unique, speculative ways. They often seem wild, but are grounded in evidence, reason and plausibility.

They also had a lot of colourful dinosaurs, basing the argument on the fact that our modern dinosaurs the birds often have very elaborate colour displays.

There’s a very flamboyant Majungasaurus:

A fluffy alvarezsaur:

A Buitreraptor with some ornate feathers:

This plesiosaur has got some very interesting coloration:

These Jinfengopteryx have some nice colours going on:

And there’s this hadrosaur:

I’m going to have to force myself to stop now, but the point is that: Many well-respected paleoartists - namely John Conway, Joschua Knuppe and C.M. Kosemen - are beginning to speculate on dinosaur coloration.

If you want more, I recommend you go to [Paleoart, mainly Dinosaurs by Hyrotrioskjan on DeviantArt](https://hyrotrioskjan.deviantart.com/gallery/26535146/Paleoart-mainly-Dinosaurs "hyrotrioskjan.deviantart.com") or [John Conway's Art](http://johnconway.co/ "johnconway.co")

Thanks for asking!
