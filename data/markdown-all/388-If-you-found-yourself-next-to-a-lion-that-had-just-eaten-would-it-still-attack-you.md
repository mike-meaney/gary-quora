## If you found yourself next to a lion that had just eaten, would it still attack you?

I’ve read before in books - not peer-reviewed papers, mind you - that zebras and other grazers are not skittish in the presence of full-bellied lions. However, I can’t find any such thing on the Internet so there’s no point in assuming it’s true.

However, what must be said is that lions are known to engage in surplus killing, or “killing for sport” as you might (possibly anthropomorphically) call it. During the wildebeest migrations in the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem, lions often maul passing wildebeest and leave the carcasses untouched.

This is mainly down to the killer instinct, which cannot be suppressed even when full.
