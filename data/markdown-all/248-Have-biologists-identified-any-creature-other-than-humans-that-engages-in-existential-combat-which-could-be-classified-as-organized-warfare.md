## Have biologists identified any creature other than humans that engages in existential combat, which could be classified as organized warfare?

The definition of warfare is a bit fuzzy, but there are several types of animal which engage in very war-like behaviour. Spotted hyenas are a good example.

They live in groups called clans, which consist of about 30–100 individuals. Each clan has a territory, which might span as little 40 square kilometers in a very prey-rich area, or as much as 1,000 in somewhere barren like the Kalahari. The border of each territory is demarcated with scented secretions at special latrine sites.

Hans Kruuk, the world’s foremost hyena scientist, studied clans in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, and managed to outline their various territories. You’ll notice that the borders overlap in some cases - this is probably due to the Crater’s highly enclosed nature.

Except in times of famine, the borders are usually respected. In fact, packs of spotted hyena pursuing prey have been known to stop dead in their tracks upon arriving at another clan’s border. However, when trespassing does occur, the result can be an organized, violent conflict known as a clan war.

On each side, dozens of individuals gather. While, sometimes, it’ll just be all posturing and calling, it often turns to violence - there can even be fatalities. These clan wars bear an uncanny resemblance to the territorial conflicts humans so often have, and they could be considered actual warfare.
