I’m not aware of any one species which lives on every continent. While you can say the Americas are only one continent, or even Afro-Eurasia is only one continent, it doesn’t make much of a difference at the end of the day - Antarctica, which is undeniably a continent, is the killer here.

While some humans have been to Antarctica - a handful of them for years - I don’t think this counts as part of the species’ natural range. If an alien zoologist was observing our species, they would probably classify these people as vagrants, or accidentals - individuals found outside their species’ range.

So, with that in mind, Homo sapiens and the parasites associated with it are only found on six continents (or five, or four, depending on what you consider a continent). It’s also worth noting that a good chunk of the land on the planet has almost no human habitation (the grey areas on this map):

Since you said “on” every continent, I’m assuming you mean on land. However, if we stretch the question a bit to include the shallow continental shelf surrounding the land, then the blue whale would qualify:

As you can see, its range extends to the coastline of almost everywhere, except for the Arctic ocean and shallow waters like the Med, the Red Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Black Sea.

The distantly related killer whale also makes the cut:

The great white shark almost qualifies too, but can’t stand the chill of Antarctic waters:

Going back to land animals, let’s look at a few which come close to inhabiting all seven. The peregrine falcon probably comes the closest, as it lives, well, basically everywhere:

There are numerous other bird species, the cattle egret among them, which make six continents:

Another great feathered example is the barn owl:

Among mammals, some notable cosmopolitan species include the wild boar, which is found naturally on three continents but has been introduced to three more by humans (marked in turquoise):

The brown rat, which is evidently planning world domination. Due to enormous eradication efforts, Alberta is the largest rat-free populated area on the planet.

And then there’s its less all-consuming cousin, the black rat:

Of course, there are also humans, their parasites, and their domesticated animals, which generally obey the range in the first picture of this answer.

So, thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed looking at a lot of maps. To conclude, I’ll finish with a final range map. It’s not for a single species - it’s for the six species of flamingo - but I find it very interesting nevertheless:

(As a disclaimer, flamingos have been introduced in parts of the US, Europe, East Asia and southern Australia as well).
