## How is the rock hyrax the closest relative to an elephant when they look nothing alike? What other pairs of animals are close relatives that don't resemble each other much?

Well first of all, Afrotherians (elephants, hyraxes, manatees, aardvarks and sengis) have been largely outcompeted by Boroeutherians (all other placental mammals except anteaters, sloths and armadillos) in the past few epochs, so all the groups in between hyraxes and elephants have been eliminated.

They do, in fact, share various similarities. For one thing, they both have hooves, they’re both herbivores and they both live in Africa. Then, of course, they are united by their DNA, which is how we determine that they’re so closely related.

Mind you, hyraxes are not the closest relatives of elephants. The cohort Afrotheria has two divisions - Afrosoricida and Paenungulata. Afrosoricidans include things like tenrecs, sengis and aardvarks, while paenungulates all have hooves.

As you can see, the hyraxes are the most basal paenungulates, while the closest relatives of elephants are in fact sirenians - dugongs and manatees. If we include extinct taxa, then their closest cousins are the desmostylians, a prehistoric order of marine mammals resembling flippered hippopotami.

Together, the orders Proboscidea, Desmostylia and Sirenia make up the clade Tethytheria, which are so named because their common ancestor is thought to have originated in the Tethys sea. Hyraxes, meanwhile, are placed outside the group.

A few favourites:

Mammals & tunicates (which are both chordates):

Barnacles and copepods (which are both in the class Maxillopoda)

Bovids and cetaceans (which are both artiodactyls)

There are many more examples I can think of, but above is just a few that come to mind.
