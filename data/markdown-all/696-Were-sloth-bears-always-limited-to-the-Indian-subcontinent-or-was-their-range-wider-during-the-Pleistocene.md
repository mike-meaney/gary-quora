## Were sloth bears always limited to the Indian subcontinent, or was their range wider during the Pleistocene?

Not that we know of. According to Wikipedia;

> A fragment of fossilized [humerus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humerus "en.wikipedia.org") from the Pleistocene, found in [Andhra Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andhra_Pradesh "en.wikipedia.org")'s [Kurnool Basin](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kurnool_Basin&action=edit&redlink=1 "en.wikipedia.org")

As you may know, Andhra Pradesh is in India. The only other mention of Melursus fossils is this:

> The fossilized skulls of a bear once named Melursus theobaldi found in the [Shivaliks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shivaliks "en.wikipedia.org")

This indicates that the sloth bear at least originated in the Indian subcontinent (since M. theobaldi is the likely ancestor of the modern species), and as of yet there are no fossils outside the Indian subcontinent, at least according to my research.

I entered Melursus ursinus into the (frequently inaccurate) Paleobiology Database, but nothing came up.
