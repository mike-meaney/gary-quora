Neither. Lions aren’t found in the Sahara:

And the only Saharan hyena is the striped hyena, which is far too shy to hunt down and eat a large and very strange-looking mammal. Thirst would get Mr. President first without a shadow of a doubt, unless he’s some kind of survival expert, which would surprise me.

Once he’s dead, though, there’s a chance the hyenas might eat him, but it’d more likely be smaller scavengers.
