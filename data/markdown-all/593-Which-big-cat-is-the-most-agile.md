Some answers below say that the leopard is the most agile. And, leopards are incredibly athletic. They can climb trees outstandingly for their size (A rule we have among zoologist states that “size diminishes climbing ability but increases ground speed.”). They can run at 58 km/h (Usain Bolt’s top speed is 44 km/h, but most mammals are faster than humans anyway.), jump six metres horizontally (Less than 3 metres off the human record) and jump 3 metres vertically (The highest a human can jump is 1.5 metres).

Then we have our other candidate, the cheetah. British biomechanist Alan Wilson proved in 2013 that agility is in fact far more important to cheetahs than speed. In a single stride, they can slow down by 9 metres per second. They can go from naught to 60 (mi/h) in only 3 seconds, and has the tightest turning radius of any mammal. Large, only semi-retractile claws and a flexible spine give it great grip - even more than that of a motorbike. And it rather demolishes the leopard in terms of jumping ability, being able to leap 10 metres far and 4.5 metres high.

Here’s a little comparison between the two:

As you can see, I couldn’t find any material regarding the acceleration/deceleration of the leopard, but trust me - the cheetah’s uncontested in that field anyway.

Now, after weighing up those statistics, it’s clear the cheetah comes out on top in my opinion. It beats the already amazingly agile leopard in pretty much every category except climbing ability.

Note: No disrespect whatsoever to Nick, he was more talking about agility in the climbing sense, and in that case he was right as well, while my answer is more a statistical study of agility in general.
