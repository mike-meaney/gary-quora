## Has an animal ever had an extraordinary number of wings (more than 2 for birds and bats, more than 4 for insects)?

The palaeodictyopterans were a group of insects that lived about 300 million years ago, and they had six wings. In addition to four large wings, they possessed a little pair of “winglets” just behind their head.

The evolution of insect flight is still shrouded in mystery, but it’s thought that insects originally might have had six or more wings, before losing all but four. The palaeodictyopterans could represent a transitional phase.

As for a four winged bird, the closest thing would probably be dinosaurs like Microraptor, Changyuraptor and Wulong. They weren’t quite birds, but certainly would have looked the part.

Found in China during the early Cretaceous, they all had feathery “wings” on both their arms on legs. These wings were originally thought to have been for gliding or “parachuting”, but some researchers have made compelling arguments that Microraptor and its relatives evolved powered flight independently of birds.

Speaking of gliding, there’s another, even weirder animal which arguably deserves inclusion - Sharovipteryx. This reptile was one of the [countless wacky creatures](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-period-in-the-ancient-history-of-Earth-Is-it-the-Triassic-the-Jurassic-the-Cambrian-the-Devonian-or-other/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") produced by the bizarre Triassic period, and it’s famous for having patagia (wing membranes) on its rear limbs, not its forelimbs.

However, it’s possible that it had additional, smaller patagia stretched across the forearms, for extra lift. This would count it as one of the very few four-winged vertebrates to have evolved in Earth’s history, and probably the strangest.

So, there’s a six-winged insect, a four-winged almost-bird and a possibly four-winged reptile on crack. Those are the only species that meet your criteria I can think of for now. Thanks for reading everyone, and have a great day.
