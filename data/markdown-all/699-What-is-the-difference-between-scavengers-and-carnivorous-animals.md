It’s not so much a difference as it is a subset.

A carnivore is, by definition, an animal that consumes other animals. But there are a number of different types of carnivores. For example, a baleen whale and a lion are both predators, but their methods of predation are altogether very different. The former is a filter-feeder, while the latter is an active predator, but collectively, they are grouped as predators, because they consume live prey.

However, a scavenger is an animal that eats dead animals. One could argue that this is a bad way of describing it, because what does a predator eat once its killed its prey? A dead animal.

Anyway, the carrion a scavenger eats must be killed by another animal or other causes for it to be scavenging. Almost any predator that can kill large prey, however, will scavenge as well, so the two groups often overlap.

To summarize, a scavenger is a carnivorous animal, but it just doesn’t kill the prey item itself.
