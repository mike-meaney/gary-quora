In 1851, Richard Owen - the world’s leading authority on paleontology and anatomy at the time - was shipped a sandstone fossil from Quebec. The rock contained the trackways of some creature - but it was formed in the Middle Cambrian epoch, roughly 500 million years ago.

Owen recognized that the tracks had been made by some kind of land animal, and that they were the earliest such tracks - he at first thought the culprit to be a turtle (they didn’t have dating methods back then so it didn’t sound ridiculous), but then, upon closer inspection, decided it was some kind of arthropod.

He was right, as two more fossils found in 2010 confirmed that the tracks were probably made by an obscure group of arthropods, the Euthycarcinoids. It’s thought that these were the first animals to venture onto the land, feeding on microbial mats when the tide went out.

It’s pretty amazing to think that when Tiktaalik roseae, the forerunner of the tetrapods, first crawled out of a swamp 375 million years ago, there had already been animals on land for over 100 million years.
