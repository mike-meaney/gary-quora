## Why do canines (dogs, wolves, foxes etc.) have better stamina than felines (lions, cheetahs, domestic cats, etc.)?

Felids and canids represent two very different hunting strategies among today’s large carnivores. If you look at a leopard, there’s a lot you might notice about their adaptations.

Working from left to right, we first have a very long, thin tail, perfect for balance. Then we have the muscular hindlegs, which are noticeably larger than those at the front, allowing the cat to make powerful pounces.

The wrists of the forelegs are highly elastic and flexible, which mean that it can grapple prey with its paws. The claws on these paws are retractable, so as to prevent the ground from dulling their sharpness.

The ears have incredibly acute hearing, enabling leopards to pick up minute noises in sound-dampening forests. The snout is very short and robust, built for delivering a quick, crushingly lethal bite. Inside it, the stabbing canines are by far the most prominent of the teeth.

Now let’s compare that to a wolf.

The tail is shorter, but bushier, and is thus a useful communication tool. Rather than being thick and muscled, the legs are slim, designed with running in mind. The claws are not retractable, and thus very blunt, but help a lot with traction.

The snout, this time, is elongated. with less bite force, but plenty of room for elaborate olfactory equipment. Scents carry well in open environments, after all. Looking at the teeth, we see that the canines are (ironically) smaller and it is the carnassials which stand out. These are built for crushing and grinding food, not killing.

So, what does this all mean? In short, most cats are adapted to be solitary ambush predators which lie in wait, pounce, and instantly kill their prey. On the other hand, dogs and their relatives are more geared towards using cooperation and stamina to run their prey into the ground, and start eating before their victims are dead.

That, in essence, is why canines have superior endurance to the average feline; rather than engaging in long-distance pursuits, cats just get in close to the prey, concealed, and then dispatch it in seconds. There are exceptions to this rule, of course…

Spotted hyenas, despite being on the “cat-like” branch of the carnivore orders, are deep inside the canine camp when it comes to hunting tactics.

As you can see, they’ve got the same short tails, slim legs, unretractable claws, long snouts, huge carnassials and social habits of dogs and their kin.

In the big cat group, you’ve got the lion, a pride-dwelling beast which has some adaptations more characteristic of the dog-like mode of hunting. And of course there’s a cheetah, a major outlier…

Anatomically, a cheetah is basically a greyhound with the head of a mountain lion. They have poor stamina, but their claws are nevertheless unretractable. They have slender limbs for running, but their snout is short and deadly. Cheetahs don’t really fit into either category; rather, they use superior agility and speed to quickly chase down their prey, then dispatch it.

Anyway, long story short, most large canines have better stamina than felines because they specialize in long-distance chases. Most large felines prefer to use brute strength, stealth and efficiency to get something to eat.
