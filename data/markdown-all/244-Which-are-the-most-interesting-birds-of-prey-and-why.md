Nice question, let’s get started.

*   The king vulture is much more colourful than most birds of prey, which makes it immediately recognizable. Its bald neck is orange and pink, with a yellow throat, black head feathers, a red-tipped beak, an orange wattle, a pair of purple wattles, an orange eye-ring, and a fleshy structure running down the head and neck which is in hues of grey, orange and bright yellow.

*   The Tasmanian wedge-tailed eagle is one of the only instances of insular gigantism, as it’s known, in birds of prey. As its name suggests, it lives on the island of Tasmania. Islands are hard to access, so the ones which do make it over - i.e. this eagle’s ancestors - are relatively free from competition and can evolve to be much bigger. The Tassie variety, with wingspans of up to 2.84 metres, can be 40% larger than a standard wedge-tailed eagle.

*   Owls are famously nocturnal creatures, but the northern pygmy-owl is one of a few exceptions. It’s instead active during the day, and as such lacks the incredible hearing abilities of other owls. There are lots of other interesting quirks about it; it mainly hunts other birds (some up to thrice its size, like chickens), and has been known to hang its prey on thorns like a shrike.

*   While it’s by no means obscure, the secretarybird is a fascinating species. It has a whole family (Sagittariidae) to itself, and its name probably comes from the Arabic word saqr-et-tair, meaning “hunter-bird”. It’s an apt description, as the secretarybird is a voracious ground predator of small reptiles and mammals, and can even kill young gazelles and cheetah cubs. 1.3 metres tall, their long legs are used to stomp prey to death.

*   The southern crested caracara is found further south than any other bird of prey, as far as the southern tip of South America in fact. It’s a member of the caracaras, Polyborinae, which are in turn a subfamily of falcons. Crested caracaras are the only birds in the order Falconiformes which actually build their nests, as other species usually just repurpose old nests no longer in use.

To me, these five taxa are fascinating birds of prey. However, if I was to pick just one species to claim the title, it would have to be the lammergeier or bearded vulture - to learn more about that species, you should check out [this answer.](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-facts-about-the-Lammergeier/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")
