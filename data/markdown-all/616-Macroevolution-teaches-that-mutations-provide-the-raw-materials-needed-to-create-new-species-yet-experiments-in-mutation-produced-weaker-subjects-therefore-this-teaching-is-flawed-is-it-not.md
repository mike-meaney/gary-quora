## Macroevolution teaches that mutations provide the raw materials needed to create new species, yet experiments in mutation produced weaker subjects, therefore, this teaching is flawed is it not?

Ah, the old “there are no beneficial mutations” argument. Could you not have looked this up? Literally every Creationist argument ever has been debunked, so it’s not as if asking on Quora is the only way to get answers.

I ask you; please drink a glass of milk. Wait a while. If you don’t get cramps, bloating, gas, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, or vomiting, this could mean two things.

1.  You are a baby and should not be using Quora
2.  Your argument is incorrect

If you are not a baby, your argument is incorrect (It’s also incorrect if you are, but that’s irrelevant). You see, virtually all mammals are unable to drink milk after the nursing stage and thereafter are permanently lactose intolerant. So were humans, originally.

However, at sometime or other, a mutation occurred in our genes which allowed us to be lactose tolerant as adults. I, for one, like ice cream very much, so I would consider this to be a beneficial mutation.

This is also an example of how information can be “added” to an organism by mutations, thus debunking yet another Creationist argument.
