Good question! I’ve already written a [similar answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-remarkable-caterpillars-discovered/answer/Gary-Meaney?ch=10&oid=172075705&share=1b6b2557&srid=pChjI&target_type=answer "www.quora.com") about caterpillars, but all of the ones I described were moths, not butterflies, so I won’t be repeating myself. Let’s begin.

*   The glasswing butterfly, a native of South and Central America. It has an incredible camouflage strategy; rather than using cryptic colouration, its wings are simply transparent. They are formed of unimaginably complex microscopic structures called nanopillars, which are arranged in such a way that they never reflect any light.

*   Queen Alexandra’s birdwing, the world’s largest butterfly. The wingspan of the females can measure up to 28 centimetres, or nearly a foot. In fact, they’re so big that butterfly collectors used to shoot them out of the sky with shotguns. The species is sadly endangered, found in only one province of Papua New Guinea.

*   The Lycaenidae family. The larvae of most species in this group are myrmecophilous, meaning they live among ant colonies. These caterpillars secrete placating chemicals, which disguise their foreign nature to the ants and even convincing the colony to protect them. Once they become butterflies, they can no longer do this, so they must escape before the ants turn on them.

(For some more really cool examples of myrmecophily, see the end of [this answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-organisms-that-most-people-dont-even-know-exist/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"))

*   Speaking of ants, the grizzled skipper. This species is common in Europe, especially England, but it has a very interesting behaviour. It appears to communicate with nearby ants by vibrating its wings at high speed, perhaps to pacify them. It is not known how sophisticated this communication system is.

*   Eighty-eight butterflies, a South and Central American genus with patterns on their wings that look remarkably like the number 88, but sometimes more like 89 or 98. 88 (and the number eight in general) is considered lucky in Chinese culture, although it is sadly also used as an abbreviation by Neo-Nazis.

*   The apefly, a species native to Southeast Asia. While the vast majority of butterfly species are herbivorous, eating leaves as caterpillars and nectar as adults, apefly larvae (top right) are a rare example of carnivory - they eat scale insects. It gets its unusual name from the appearance of the pupa, bottom left, which vaguely resembles a primate’s face.

*   The giant swallowtail. It’s the largest butterfly in North America, and the adults have a striking black and yellow colour scheme. The caterpillars, however, are far less pretty. In order to camouflage, they mimic bird droppings with startling accuracy. Pretty sh\*t disguise if you ask me.

*   The spicebush swallowtail. To my knowledge, it is the only animal in the world\* that engages in three different forms of mimicry over its life cycle. The newborn larvae mimic bird droppings, like the last one, then morph into snake mimics. They have eye spots and even forked red tongues, and behave like serpents. Finally, the adults mimic pipevine swallowtails, an unpalatable species.

\*I suppose the mimic octopus also meets these criteria, but it doesn’t actually change its physical structure to imitate different species.

*   The Gulf fritillary, another species with a unique larval form. The caterpillars of this species are bright orange, and have nasty-looking spikes projecting from them at all angles. The spines themselves are harmless - they’re soft and flimsy - but the caterpillars also release foul-smelling chemicals to deter predators.

*   The Chinese bush brown, whose larvae look much less threatening. In fact, they are often compared to the character Hello Kitty, due to their little triangular “ears”… now that’s what I call a cat-erpillar. Some related species in the same family, Nymphalidae, have very similar-looking larvae.

*   The Indian oakleaf, a very cool example of camouflage. When the wings are open, it is a beautiful butterfly, with different shades of blue and two vivid orange bands. However, once the wings shut and their underside is revealed, the oakleaf becomes, well… a leaf, hidden from predators.

*   The blue clipper, a creature found in tropical Asia. The main reason I’ve included it here is that it is simply absolutely stunning: it’s got some of the most intricate patterning you’ll ever see in nature, combined with vibrant colours. Also, interestingly enough, it has the habit of gliding in between spurts of flight.

*   The Bhutan glory, another winner of beauty contests. As its name suggests, it is found in the nation of Bhutan and other parts of the Eastern Himalayas. I don’t really have any mind-blowing facts about this one, admittedly, I just thought it was gorgeous and very unique-looking.

So, those are all my top picks for the most bizarre and interesting butterfly species. Though most people pass moths off as the bland and dull cousins of butterflies, I find they’re a lot more diverse and fascinating, especially when it comes to freaky caterpillars.

That said, as we’ve seen, butterflies still have some very intriguing specimens among their ranks. Thank you very much for reading, and have a great day.
