In contrast to another answer, I’m going to interpret “saber-tooth tiger” slightly differently, as I believe you are referring to the group (a subfamily of Felidae) termed as the “saber-toothed cats”, or machairodonts.

Ultimately, an organisms greatest disadvantage is usually - but not always - what causes its extinction, provided that it is a result of out-competition, rather than some some cataclysmic event. The thing is, however, that nobody really knows why machairodont cats went extinct - indeed, it is probably a result of multiple factors.

Before I go any further, it is important to note that extinctions are caused; a species does not simply run out of evolutionary momentum, an unsatisfactory explanation which is often reserved for the saber-toothed cats.

Obviously, being a whole subfamily, there were many species, all of which came and went over the ages. However, the last three genera - and the ones which, upon being wiped out, would spell extinction for the machairodonts - were Megantereon, Homotherium and Smilodon.

Of those three, Smilodon lasted the longest, and its extinction was probably somewhat different to that of the other two. In any case, you have Homotherium and Megantereon, two widespread - and therefore successful - genera which disappeared in a geologically short space of time.

So, both Homotherium and Megantereon went extinct in Africa before they went extinct in North America. It is quite a puzzling problem, because - as you can see in the illustration above (by Mauricio Anton), Homotherium has quite a peculiar, hyena-like limb configuration, which seems to be an adaptation for running in open terrain.

However, Homotherium went extinct in Africa - before it did in America - specifically at a time when forests were turning into open plains, which the limb configuration seems to be adapted specifically to. Furthermore, the Homotherium in North America were joined by another cat, Smilodon - a descendant of Megantereon \- which also had that limb configuration, yet only lived in America.

It’s difficult to answer this enigma with certainty, but we must remember that geographical differences will bring ecological differences, and therefore, differences in the success of the animal. Africa, since the Pliocene, has been more or less in the same position, sitting astride the equator, while North America is well above it. Therefore, the differing vegetation will bring differing responses to climatic change.

Another difference is that the two continents, Africa and North America, had different ungulate faunas, and thus different available prey species. North America, until very recently, had no bovids (cattle and allies, antelope, and goats), and only a few deer, with pronghorns filling the niche of them in some respect. Because of those differences, the two species were bound to go extinct in different ways.

You see, around 3.2 million years ago, climatic change triggered a surge in the diversity of the antelopes, and made cursorial predators more common. Sabre-tooth cats, due to their fragile dentition, were likely surgical, precise killers, so cursorialism was not a way of life suited to them. Because of that, Homotherium and Megantereon went extinct in Africa first.

Smilodon, again from Mauricio Anton

Megantereon probably went extinct due to competition from its direct descendant, Smilodon, due to the latter having evolved in America while the former was a widespread genus - Smilodon was more adapted to a North American way of life, in other words.

That leaves us with two genera, Homotherium and Smilodon, both in North America and North America alone. Then, only 130,00 years ago, a new species from the Old World crossed over the Bering land bridge and colonized the Americas - Homo sapiens.

Humans, due to their tools, social organization, and above all, intelligence, had paved their way to North America in the carcasses of megafaunal species, and in the New World, they would do the same. Their unnatural way of hunting meant that most of the massive, so-called “Pleistocene megafauna”, was driven close to extinction within a few thousand years.

The saber-toothed cats depended on that megafauna for food, and just 10,000 years after the arrival of man in the Americas, Homotherium went extinct. Smilodon proved more resistant to the change, for whatever reason, and managed to cling on to existence for a further 11,000 years. Ultimately, though, it too would succumb to mankind’s overhunting, and it disappeared.
