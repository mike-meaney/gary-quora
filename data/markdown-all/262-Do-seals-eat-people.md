Eat? No. Kill? Very rarely.

In 2003, the British marine biologist Kirsty Brown became the first human known to have been killed by a seal. She was snorkelling in the Bellinghausen Sea, near Rothera research station, when a leopard seal pulled her under the water.

A rescue boat was swiftly launched and she was hauled out of the ocean, unconscious. Her colleagues attempted to revive her but she soon died. Since then, there have been no other human fatalities caused by seals.

Leopard seals are hypercarnivorous macropredators, and can savage penguins and even other seals. They have huge canines and nasty jagged teeth, and though they almost never attack humans, I wouldn’t do anything stupid in the presence of one.

The attack on Kirsty Brown was evidently unprovoked. She might have been mistaken for a seal. Rather unusually, none of the known attacks have involved humans bothering the seals (indeed, you rarely get Antarctic explorers that daft). Take for example this encounter in 1985:

> Suddenly, the surface erupted as the massive head and shoulders of a mature leopard seal, mouth gaping in expectation, crashed through the eggshell covering. It closed its powerful jaws around my right leg, and I fell backward, shocked and helpless.

Had the seal not been deterred by the victim Gareth Cook’s colleagues, he probably would’ve held Kirsty’s title instead.
