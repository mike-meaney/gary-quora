No; though they are indeed more closely related to cats than dogs (In that they’re in the suborder Feliformia), retractable claws evidently weren’t an ancestral condition of Feliforms. It seems as though cats and a few viverrids have evolved them independently.

Retractable claws evolve so that claws can be kept sharp, not exposed to the ground where they can be bluntened as the animal walks. Hyenas don’t need sharp claws; for them, it’s all in the bite. Non-retractable claws do, however, help with traction, which is beneficial since hyenas are running predators.
