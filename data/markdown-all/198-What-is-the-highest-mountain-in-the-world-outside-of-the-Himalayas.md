The world’s second-highest mountain is K2, which is located in the Karakoram range, not the Himalayas. Its peak stands 8,611 metres above sea level, 237 metres below the summit of Everest, and only 25 metres above the next-highest mountain - Kanchengjunga, of the Himalayas.

By elevation, it’s certainly the highest outside the Himalayas, although actual topographical prominence, relative to the ground, is another story. In that arena, it comes in 22nd place, outclassed by Everest, Kilimanjaro, Mont Blanc and Mauna Kea, among other mountains.

It was christened with its somewhat boring name back in 1856 - “K” stands for Karakoram. There was once a K1, K3, K4 and K5 too, but they have since been renamed. Despite several attempts in the first half of the 20th century, K2 was not summited until 1954, when a team of Italians reached the top.

Many consider this expedition to be much less than heroic, however. A pair of men, named Walter Bonatti and Ahmir Mehdi - the former Italian and the latter Pakistani - were to climb the mountain and meet the lead climbers with oxygen about 95% of the way up. In return, they were both promised a spot on the team to reach the summit.

However, Bonatti and Medhi were betrayed by the two lead Italian climbers, pictured above, who likely feared that they’d be outshined by the younger, fitter pair. They were left alone in the dark, 8,100 metres above sea level, without proper shelter. The two were forced to bivouac higher than anyone had ever done before, at the time, and as a result, the Pakistani tragically got frostbite and later had to have his toes amputated.

One last fact, just for good measure. Both the Himalayas and the Karakoram were created by the Indian subcontinent’s collision with mainland Asia. The same can be said of the Hindu Kush, Pamirs, Hengduan Mountains, Tian Shan and Transhimalayan range. Suppose that India had remained an island - what would the highest mountain be?

It would, in fact, be Aconcagua in the Andes, which stands a “paltry” 6,961 metres. Globally, Aconcagua is only the 138th highest mountain! So, in other words, India colliding with Eurasia created 137 mountains higher than any other, on the planet. I find that quite cool.
