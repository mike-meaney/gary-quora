I answered a similar question before, but I’ve reconsidered and changed my mind - I think it’s got to be Greg Rasmussen, a wildlife biologist and conservationist famous for his research on African wild dogs.

Greg Rasmussen

In 2003, Zimbabwe, he was due to track rhinos in a plane. Unfortunately, his pilot pulled out at the last minute, so he would have to fly the aircraft himself. Also, due to the short notice, he was dehydrated before taking off, and the water pumps at the hotel he stopped at weren’t working, so he couldn’t drink there either.

All these coincidences would prove to be very, very unlucky.

On the second leg of his flight, the rhino’s tracking collar started signalling, and he rose. However, as he climbed, he was hit with an unexpected blast of wind, and the plane spiraled out of control, crashing in the arid grassland.

The savanna of Matebeleland North, the province where he crashed

Greg was bleeding and had broken both legs and his pelvis. Using only his arms, he pulled himself out of the cockpit, and then spent two hours trying to get his boots off (which were causing excruciating pain in his feet). After all that, he was “indescribably” dehydrated, yet hadn’t a drop of water.

Things got even worse when the sun set and the animals started getting active. He was approached by a herd of African elephants, which nearly stampeded him, and all he could do was bang his fist on the plane as loudly as he could. Thankfully, that worked. He was even approached by a pride of lions, but the same strategy scared them off.

Lions in the night

Through his vigilance, he survived the night, and two hours after the sun rose a helicopter located and rescued him. While Greg was incredibly unlucky to find himself in all those coinciding circumstances, he was nearly a lot unluckier - the helicopter almost struck a bird on the way back to the hospital.

Rasmussen has now more or less recovered, after dozens upon dozens of operations on his legs, although he’s now 3 inches shorter. At least in that, luck was on his side. In any case, I think that his story is a testament to how the right mindset can get you through the most dire of straits.
