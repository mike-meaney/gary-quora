## If all mammal and bird species were enlarged or shrunken to be the size of a German Shepherd, which animal could defeat all others? Also, would the enlarged or the shrunken animals have the advantage?

Most of the birds would die very soon.

You’ve probably heard of the square-cube law, and you probably thus know that larger animals produce more heat - but it’s less simple than that.

Body temperature is a function of metabolic rate, and we get the metabolic rate in kilocalories per day by multiplying the mass in kilograms by K. K is a constant which varies depending on the type of organism.

K is lowest - at about 1 or 2 - for plants, and highest for birds - specifically, passerine birds - at 129. That’s nearly twice as high as it is for a placental mammal. Anyway, the point is that - even though dog-size isn’t too big compared to an average bird, the enormous K value would spell their toasty doom.

Whales and elephants might die before long too.

All of the top 10 largest animals are whales, and I predict that for all of them, even German shepherd-size would be too small to stay warm. If they were in a warm environment, their blubber might spare them, but in their natural habitat, they’d fall victim to the cold.

Using [this paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2316192 "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov") I calculated that the surface area of an African elephant is roughly 40 square metres. It’s probably a very, very hazy estimate but it’ll do. Now, according to my calculations, decreased to the length of a German shepherd its area’ll decrease to 4 metres. Not ideal.

The winner?

If all these mammals and birds were incited with a sudden unstoppable will to kill one another… I’d say they’d probably all die. But which ones would be alive last?

Birds of prey have the advantage of aerial mobility, but to actually kill the mammals they’d need to get down to ground level. So, I’d say the mammals would outlast the birds. In close combat, tooth and claw would be favoured. Perhaps hippos, wolverines, honey badgers or hyenas would be last standing (the great numbers and cooperative ability of the last one would help).

However, if these combatants had time to wait, a different strategy might be the winner - venom. There are a handful of mammalian species which produce venom (although we can cross out platypi because a spur on the hindlimb isn’t the best-placed weapon). Perhaps the victor would be some kind of giant solenodon, or an outsize vampire bat.
