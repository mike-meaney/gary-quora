There are plenty of animals in Africa which are, in truth, fascinating, but receive little attention from the public. Here are a few of my favourites.

Spotted hyena

These aren’t underrated in the same way as others on this list, in that most people know what a hyena is. However, very few people actually know what hyenas really look like - I find them quite beautiful, actually. They are rarely featured in documentaries, and when they are, they’re either eating from a carcass (Which the viewers assume to be scavenged, even though that it is, most of the time, killed by the hyenas) or appropriating kills from lions.

African civet

Most people who go on safaris in Africa come away knowing nothing as to what a civet is - yet I find them very cool. The pattern of spots is unique to each individual, like a tiger’s stripes or human fingerprint. When they are agitated, a long mane of hairs running from their neck to their tail is erected. African civets are omnivores, and eat everything from frogs to insects to figs. They have been hunted heavily for the secretions from their perineal glands, which are used to make musk.

Bat-eared fox

A member of the dog family, the bat-eared fox is unique in that it eats almost exclusively termites. They’ve got a nice tawny-black coat, and dark fur around their eyes which reduces glare from the sun. They use their huge ears to pinpoint their insect prey, which they hunt in pairs or in three. They’re highly social, living in groups of up to 15, which break up in the summer months after the cubs have been born. As well as termites, they sometimes eat moths, ants, small mammals and even fungi.

Large-spotted genet

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-45557f8a5a2f110717e8031ff7a9d020-lq)

Genets are in the same taxonomic family as the civets we mentioned earlier, Viverridae. However, genets like this large-spotted one are much more lithe and have longer tails. The captive one above is on the ground, but they usually spend most of their time in trees. They’re exceptionally agile, and are the only viverrids that can stand on their hind legs. The large-spotted genet above is really cool, because it rides on the back of buffalo and rhinos to feed on the flies they stir up.

Klipspringer

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-48df24b4ad7d063cb587dcf189b5dd21-lq)

Klipspringers are small, elegant antelopes, most closely related to the similarly-looking dik-diks and duikers. What’s fascinating about them in particular however is their habitat - they’re specialized inhabitants of extremely rocky areas, like high mountains and lava flows. Their hooves are tall and the two toes are widely spaced. I’ve only seen these once in the wild, when I was at the Shetani lava flow in Kenya. Graceful things, they are.

Greater kudu

Along with the more chocolate-coloured nyala, kudus are probably the most attractive antelopes for me. They’re huge, and have thin white dorsal tripes, long fur on their shoulders and throat, and enormous spiral horns. You may have heard the news that this summer, in Mana Pools, Zimbabwe, a pack of hyenas slayed a kudu in the lobby of a lodge. Grisly, yes, but a testament to Africa’s wildness.

Topi

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f2996b3e33e5b7fdbe946df0c577cdd0-lq)

Topis are Africa’s fastest ungulate, fitting opponents for the cheetah - a much more famous speedster. They can reach speeds of 70 kilometres per hour, yet despite this, are very common prey for spotted hyenas - which seem ungainly in their running. Their short hair has a very interesting colour - reddish-brown for the most part, but with “yellow socks and blue jeans”, as I’ve heard local safari guides call it.

Tree hyrax

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7420026fe0bba4ee202163606d11e380-lq)

After manatees, the closest relatives of elephants are in fact these bizarre, marmot-like animals - hyraxes. They resemble squirrels, but have five-toed hooves, and come in two flavors - rock hyraxes and tree hyraxes. Tree hyraxes, as their name suggests, live in the trees, and feed there too. During the night, they scream loudly, which often wakes guests at safari lodges.

Kori bustard

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f3f4c9c8cb2500dfb5263465d2675a05-lq)

Kori bustards are the world’s largest flying birds - yet not many people have heard of them, at least outside of Africa. They’re not too rare a sight on various open plains in Africa, and sometimes are ridden by bee-eaters, which catch the flies that are stirred up by the bustard’s movements. During the mating season, the males attempt to ward off competitors by extending a vase-shaped white bundle of plumage in their necks.

Martial eagle

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d6252eceef613db383c096afc9e7161f-lq)

The martial eagle is a very large African eagle - despite its short tail, it measures over a metre in length, and has a huge wingspan of 2.6 metres. Martial eagles are amazingly powerful predators - full-grown antelope, big cats, and a plethora of other huge prey items have been reported to be taken by them. They’ve also been seen to steal kills from adult leopards and cheetahs. There are other cool African eagle - tawny eagles, black eagles, snake eagles and fish eagles among them.

Marabou stork

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d2f34922d5565a392794fc12d4c39cb8-lq)

Most people know at least one kind of scavenging avian - the Old World vultures. However, what most people do not know is that there is another kind of bird which is an almost exclusive feeder of carrion. They’re nearly as tall as a man, but despite this, are flighted. The bald head and neck means that they don’t have to clean any feathers after digging into a bloody carcass. Marabou storks will also eat faeces, flamingos, shoes and scraps of metal.

Slender-snouted crocodile

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1b445a17a16fa524103b7155a8fee88f-lq)

Most people know that there are crocodiles in Africa, and of those, a fair few know that one such species is the Nile crocodile, which I’ve had the privilege of meeting in the wild. A less well-known species, however, is the African slender-snouted crocodile, which are of course named for their slender rostrum, and are quite a bit smaller than C. niloticus.

Nile monitor

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f964a03f3cee1f561d6b03254a6393d0-lq)

The genus Varanus is one of the most successful vertebrate genera in all the world - also known as monitors, they are highly adaptable and comprise 79 species. The most well known monitor lizard is the Komodo dragon, but they have smaller cousins which live in Africa - these are the Nile monitors. They often boldly steal crocodile eggs for a nutritious snack.

African softshell turtle

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8f8256c5135a23d8281c54b230465de8-lq)

Softshell turtles are a family of testudines which lack bony scutes on their shells, hence the name. This species, Trionyx triunguis, is found in the Central African jungles. Some theorize that exceptionally large specimens could have been the origin of stories about the Mokele-mbembe, a sauropod-like cryptid reported in the Congo Basin - to the local pygmy peoples, it would’ve looked even bigger.

Those are just a few of the African animals which I think deserve more attention from the layman - I could name a lot more. Thank you for reading and for the A2A, and I hope that the answer was satisfactory.
