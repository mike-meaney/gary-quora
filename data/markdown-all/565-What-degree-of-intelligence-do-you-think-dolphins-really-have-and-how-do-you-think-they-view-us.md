## What degree of intelligence do you think dolphins really have and how do you think they view us?

Well, let’s have a look at the facts. Dolphins, among other things:

*   have an EQ equivalent to archaic species of Homo
*   are extremely social and form cohesive units
*   maintain stable close bonds with pod-mates for years
*   use tools such as medicinal corals, narcotic pufferfish secretions, and… [dead fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkA4Mij2RFo "www.youtube.com") (note: potentially NSFW)
*   hunt cooperatively with conspecifics and even other species, including false killer whales and humans
*   have culture that can be passed down and evolve; different populations of orca have regional dialects of language and different hunting techniques
*   are highly altruistic and have attempted to save humans from shark attacks and beached whales
*   possess extremely complex communication skills
*   are self-aware, at least according to mirror tests

All this evidence makes dolphins - particularly the various bottlenose species and orcas - very, very high candidates for the most intelligent kind of animal, even more so than chimpanzees. I think that humans experience a kind of bias to chimpanzees, bonobos and other great apes because their facial expressions are easy to read and they use tools a lot.

However, while apes do display an extraordinarily complex intelligence, we must remember that animals behave according to their psychological framework, as defined [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_cognition#Biological_constraints "en.wikipedia.org"). Because of its evolutionary heredity, a hedgehog will roll into a ball when threatened, not run away. Does this mean they have poor learning skills? No, they simply act differently because they are different. Similarly, manta rays are known to be self-aware, but are terrible at problem solving due to their anatomy.

In any case, as an answer to your first question, I would say that it is extremely difficult to rank intelligence, especially at the scale of complexity seen in dolphins. However, if I were to try my best, I would put bottlenose dolphins as the most intelligent species of animal in the world, aside from humans, followed closely by great apes, orcas (also dolphins) and corvids.

Now, your second question. While it’s very difficult to interpret the goings on in the mind of a creature that is, ecologically, worlds away from us, I think we can get a vague idea of how they might perceive humans. They have very human-like societies and cultural aspects, so they may even have similar paths of thinking to us.

Assuming that the experiments are true, and dolphins really are self-aware, I would say that humans interest them significantly, and they see us in a good way. They are very curious animals, which serves as some justification for my first point.

Judging by how they play with humans in the water, strangers or otherwise, and have even on some occasions tried to mimic human speech to communicate with their owners, it seems evident that they would see us in a positive light, except in cases when they’ve been abused (dolphins have been known to deliberately stop breathing and commit suicide when kept in poor conditions)

Anyway, those are my thoughts on the matter. Hopefully it’s been of interest.
