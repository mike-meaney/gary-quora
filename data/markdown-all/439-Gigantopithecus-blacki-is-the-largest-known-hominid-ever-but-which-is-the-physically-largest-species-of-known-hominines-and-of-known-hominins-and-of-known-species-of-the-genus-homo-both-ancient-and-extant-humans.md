## Gigantopithecus blacki is the largest known hominid ever, but, which is the physically largest species of known hominines and of known hominins and of known species of the genus homo (both ancient and extant humans)?

Homininae:

For those who don’t know, hominines - also known as African apes - constitute gorillas, chimps, bonobos, humans and their extinct relatives. The largest hominine, to my knowledge, extinct or extant, is the eastern gorilla, Gorilla beringei, weighing in at a maximum of 205 kilograms.

Hominina:

Hominins include humans, australopithecines, and maybe chimps and their kin. Regardless, it doesn’t matter, since chimpanzees/bonobos are fairly small compared to humans. All the australopithecines are in and around the 50 kg mark.

This is where things get kind of tricky. There are hominin fossils of what some maintain to be “Meganthropus” (not a genus by the way), and weights of up to 300 kilograms have been suggested for it. However, these claims are generally frowned upon - see [Doubting Meganthropus](https://thelordgeekington.wordpress.com/2015/04/10/doubting-meganthropus/ "thelordgeekington.wordpress.com").

Homo:

The largest species in the genus Homo is probably Homo neandertalensis \- the Neanderthals - if they are a species, that is. An average weight for males has been estimated at 78 kilograms, as opposed to a 62 kilo average for our species. I couldn’t find a maximum weight.

Note that in this answer, I am excluding obese Homo sapiens. If we’re counting the likes of Jon Brower Minnoch, who weighed in at 635 kilograms, we would be the largest species in Homo, Hominina, Homininae, Hominidae, Primates and even Euarchontoglires.
