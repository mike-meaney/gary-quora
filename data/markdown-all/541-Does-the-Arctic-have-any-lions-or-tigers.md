One might think that the lion is specially, and only, adapted to an arid savanna habitat. Tawny fur helps it blend in with the oat-grass, and size and musculature help it take down the giant savanna megafauna. In fact, lions are the only social cats because of their unique savanna habitat. Out on the African savanna, there are all kinds of massive prey items. One might think this is a good thing, but out in a place like that, a large carcass is a liability. The savanna is full of scavengers, from hyenas to jackals to vultures, and all of them are gonna know about it when a lion pride take down a giraffe, or an elephant.

Teamwork makes it easier to defend a giant carcass from scavengers. In older days, lions would have lived alongside sabertooths and giant hyenas, and even still there are powerful predators who would steal their kill, like the spotted hyena. If you try to defend a kill on your own from a clan of them, it won’t end well.

Lions are often chased off kills by spotted hyenas

Since they’ve got all those special savanna adaptations, they must have always lived in the savanna, right?

But hang on a minute

If we look up the ranges of any of the extinct lion subspecies, we see that:

The historical range of Panthera leo

They did in fact live in the Arctic once. Fossils of the cave lion, Panthera leo spelaea, have been unearthed on the northern shores of Russia - a few degrees north of the Arctic circle. Slightly bigger than an African lion, these big cats once roamed across Eurasia, during the Ice Age.

So there used to be lions in the Arctic, but what about tigers?

Sadly, the truth here is that there are no tigers in the Arctic, and as far as we know there never was. But will there ever be?

Siberian tigers are under increasing pressure from poaching and habitat loss. What if a population of tigers decided to migrate north to flee the poachers? In some parts of Siberia, temperatures can reach -90 degrees Celsius. Many parts of the Arctic are only around -30 in winter. If lions can survive in the Arctic, so can tigers. My guess is that something similar to what happened to the polar bears will occur if and when tigers emigrate north.

When brown bears reached the Arctic, some of them had children that had white coats. Even though it was just a genetic aberration, these bears became more successful than the brown ones because they could camouflage in the snow. Eventually, all the brown bears starved before they could mate and have children, so only the better-off white bears remained.

Polar bears only evolved 150,000 years ago

If tigers migrated to the Arctic, I suspect that individuals with the well-known “white tiger” phenomenon would be favoured by natural selection. Furthermore, some white tigers are born stripeless.

Stripeless white tigers can be found in a number of zoos around the world

Like the polar bears proliferated over their brown cousins, the stripeless white tigers would overcome the orange ones, and eventually even the white striped ones.

So, to give you a short answer:

Lions used to live in the Arctic, but now they don’t. Tigers never lived in the Arctic, but if they did, they wouldn’t do too badly.
