## What are some interesting facts about any of the islands in Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria, or the gulf itself? Unlike Australia's southern island of Tasmania, these northern islands are rarely heard of.

The Gulf of Carpentaria is a large, shallow bay in the north of Australia, near the island of New Guinea. For me, the most interesting thing about it is its unique weather conditions.

For rather mysterious reasons, the Gulf is the only place on Earth where so-called Morning Glory clouds regularly and consistently form. These bizarre and beautiful cloud formations consists of low-hanging, perfectly cylindrical clouds, up to 1,000 km in length! The local aboriginals call the phenomenon kangógli.

They can even be seen over the Gulf of Carpentaria from space. Just look at how long those single, serpentine clouds are! Also note the numerous bushfires in the surrounding lands.

The exact mechanisms involved in the formation of Morning Glory Clouds, and the reasons why they’re largely isolated to the Gulf, are unknown. However even our basic understanding is quite technical for a metereological layman like me to explain. But I’ll give it a try.

During the night, something called an inversion layer forms in the atmosphere - air is hotter above this layer, and cooler below. Winds blowing over Carpentaria from the York Peninsula dip under this inversion, causing rotating cylinders of air to form. During the early morning (hence the name), these cylinders become saturated with moisture and form the clouds.

Anyway, a few more juicy tidbits of interesting info about the Gulf of Carpentaria.

Firstly, it wasn’t always part of the sea. During the last Ice Age, in the Pleistocene epoch, global temperatures were much lower, so a lot of the Earth’s water was “locked up” in vast glaciers. As a result, there wasn’t as much water available in the oceans, and sea levels were dramatically lowered.

The whole continental shelf was exposed, merging Australia, New Guinea and Tasmania into a supercontinent called Sahul, also known as Meganesia or Australinea. The deepest part of the Gulf became a landlocked freshwater lake, called Lake Carpentaria.

And the low-lying plains surrounding Lake Carpentaria would have been cloaked in warm savannahs, where exotic, now-extinct animals roamed. Speaking of which, the southern fringes of the modern gulf, combined with some of its islands, form the world’s largest continuous savannah woodlands.

These woodlands even have their own endemic species of mammal, found nowhere else. The Carpentarian rock rat is critically endangered, with less than 2,000 individuals alive in the wild - introduced foxes and cats, as well as the increasing risk of devastating wildfires, are only likely to further impact the species’ population.

One of the main reasons these rats are so vulnerable to extinction is that they have highly specialized lifestyle, inhabiting only shaded sandstone gorges. What makes them quite interesting is that they have very thick tails, which they use to store fat and survive the long dry season.

So, those are the fun and interesting facts about this Australian gulf I have to offer. If you’re ever confronted by a killer, share these and satiate his burning desire for geographical knowledge. Surely he’ll let you live.
