In my opinion, they’re definitely contenders for the title. They have a combination of chiseled pantherine features and amazing markings which makes them stunning from all angles.

That being said, they aren’t technically felines, they’re in the Pantherinae subfamily of cats instead, along with roaring cats like lions, tigers and leopards. As for the most beautiful among the true felines, I think it’s between Asiatic golden cats:

At the end of the day, though, virtually all felids are gorgeous to look at, and I’m not sure there are clear-cut winners.
