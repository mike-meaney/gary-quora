Absolutely. Evolution is an ongoing process, and life will almost definitely continue to go on for billions of years.

There’s a whole field of hard science fiction - not very well-known, but with many practitioners once you familiarize yourself with the relevant sites - about predicting how life will evolve in the future.

This field, called future evolution, is a branch of a wider term called “speculative evolution”. Other branches focus on alien life, or how life would have evolved if X event didn’t happen in the past.

The first future evolutionist was Dougal Dixon, who wrote the book After Man: A Zoology of the Future in 1981.

In his book, humanity wiped out many of the specialized groups of today and eventually themselves, leaving a host of niches open to the more adaptable creatures. Rats became apex predators, hunting giant grazing rabbits:

He wrote of giant, fully aquatic birds, massive antelopes, and an island of bats. Later, he wrote another book, Man After Man: An Anthropology of the Future. This one speculated about how humans would evolve if they had taken another path. His future humans would explode into a myriad of bizarre forms, none of which were in any way pretty.

Not much else was published on the subject of future evolution until 2002, when two works on two separate media were released.

One was Future Evolution: An Illuminated History of Things to Come, by Peter D. Ward. Much of the book was about Ward’s psychology on future evolution, but he did include animals such as flying toads in his work.

The other was The Future is Wild, a documentary whose production was helped by Dixon again, that spanned multiple eras.

With each episode, the show took you further and further into the future, ending with a world where mammals are extinct and giant terrestrial cephalopods dominate the land.

To date, no more books or documentaries have been published on future evolution, but the subject is still thriving on DeviantArt, and the Speculative Evolution forums.

There is one unpublished book called All Tomorrows by the excellent C.M. Kosemen, which is about how humans will evolve in the future.

In his scenario, humans are conquered by a godly race called the Qu, who genetically engineered humans into a myriad of forms. When the Qu were extinguished, the bizarre humans were left to evolve, and eventually produce some of the most mind-bending forms you could imagine.

If you want to see more, less publicly known examples of future evolution, I recommend you look here: [Evolutionary Continuum](http://s1.zetaboards.com/Conceptual_Evolution/forum/236087/ "s1.zetaboards.com")

If you know what you’re looking for, you can find a whole ton of future evolution ideas on DeviantArt as well.
