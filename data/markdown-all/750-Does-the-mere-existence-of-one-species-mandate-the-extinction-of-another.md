Species, genera, families… these are all human constructs. There’s nothing wrong with this, it’s just the way our mind works, but we always want to chop up the universe into even, labelled parts. But really, the universe is more of a continuous scale.

A species is an animal whose genes are X amount different from another animal. But who specifies what X should be? Nature didn’t. In fact, we didn’t really specify it on purpose. The concept of a species was developed in the 1750’s, long before the science of genetics or evolution. We just decided to stick with the term.

So, when you look at it in that way, the speciation of one animal could not mandate the extinction of another, because species are not “real”, natural concepts.

This is a very interesting question however, and its answer can be subjective.
