As far as research has shown (And pumas are a well-studied species), there are no animals that will prey on adult pumas, aside from humans. But, there are some animals which will either kill pumas because of competition, or steal their kills.

In the Yellowstone National Park, there are three apex predators; the grizzly bear, the grey wolf and the puma. It appears that grizzlies are the dominant predator of these three, though pumas and wolves may best them sometimes. Some bears meet their daily food requirements purely by stealing puma kills.

Then we have the second apex predator in North America, the grey wolf. These are probably more directly in competition with pumas. Some large pumas will be able to kill single wolves, but they’d be no match for a pack, and would usually be driven off by one.

As well as those major predators, pumas will occasionally fall into conflict with coyotes, as this interesting picture shows:

Also, pumas inhabit South America, where they may come into contact with jaguars. The jaguar usually hunts large prey while the puma hunts smaller animals, so they rarely compete, but there are records of jaguars killing puma cubs. If a jaguar did get into a fight with an adult puma, it would doubtlessly come out on top, as their bite could crush a puma’s skull.
