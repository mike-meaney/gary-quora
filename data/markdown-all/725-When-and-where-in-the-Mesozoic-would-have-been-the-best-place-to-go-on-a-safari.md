I. The Morrison Formation

This site, in Late Jurassic Utah, would have been - in my opinion - the ultimate wildlife destination in all the Mesozoic era. Here, you’d have:

*   Two different species of stegosaur
*   Five species of large theropod, along with a few smaller ones
*   One ankylosaur and several ornithopod species
*   Over a dozen species of sauropod, a few of which have been considered for the title of “largest dinosaur ever”

The sauropods would be the number one attraction here, simply because of their size; it is extremely difficult to even comprehend how big an Amphicoelias altus may have been, and - if it truly was the largest dinosaur - it would have been quite possibly the most spectacular land animal ever. Additionally, there are some really iconic genera, like Brachiosaurus, Apatosaurus and Diplodocus.

I’ve always been a fan of carnivores, particularly large ones. Normally in my case, this just means mammals, but the theropods of the Morrison are what really sells the site to me. There’s the iconic Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus as well as the massive genera Torvosaurus, Epanterias and Saurophaganax. The last one may have even been as long as good old T. rex.

The Morrison itself is thought to have been a big open plain, perhaps with some forest mosaics and salt flats.

II. The Kem Kem Formation

In North Africa’s Early Cretaceous, the Sahara was somewhat lusher than it is today, with a huge river running through it. One rock formation on this river, the Kem Kem, must have been a spectacular place indeed.

There were many sauropods here, including Paralititan and Rebbachisaurus, as well as the iconic sail-backed ornithopod Ouranosaurus. We also have fossils from a load of giant fish, mainly lobe-fins, but also a giant sawfish called Onchopristis.

Moving onto carnivores, there are a number of Early Cretaceous North African crocodylomorphs which are worthy of note. There were small, terrestrial notosuchians, and gigantic varieties such as Sarcosuchus and Aegisuchus. Now, onto theropods. There’s the famous Spinosaurus, along with Carcharodontosaurus, Rugops and a few other little-studied genera.

III. The Hell Creek Formation

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ecd454bad4b1f37ffe48a966f7288722-lq)

This is when are where some of the most iconic dinosaur of all species lived. It was a conifer forest in the Late Cretaceous of North America, and has been featured in all manner of documentaries, including Walking with Dinosaurs and When Dinosaurs Ruled America . as well as the game Saurian.

Though no sauropods have been found in HC, the massive Alamosaurus is known to have inhabited this general region, and coexisted with a lot of the Hell Creek species. In addition to that, there’s the enormous ornithopod Edmontosaurus, the ceratopsians Triceratops and Torosaurus, the ankylosaurs Edmontonia and Ankylosaurus, and a few pachycephalosaurs such as Pachycephalosaurus, Stygimoloch and Dracorex.

In terms of theropods, we’ve got a few ornithomimosaurs (including Struthiomimus and Ornithomimus), and the dromaeosaur Acheroraptor (Dakotaraptor hasn’t been found in this particular formation, but was definitely found in this particular ecoregion). And, of course, we have the iconic Tyrannosaurus rex.

Those would be the top 3 destinations I’d choose if I were to go on a safari in the Mesozoic Era. Hopefully it’s been enjoyable.
