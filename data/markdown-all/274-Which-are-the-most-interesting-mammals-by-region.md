For this answer I’ll be abiding by the United Nations geoscheme, a system which divides the world into 19 different regions. I’ll include Antarctica, too, which for some reason doesn’t get a region.

Right, let’s start with the New World…

Northern America:

I’m going to go with one that might seem mundane at a glance - the mountain beaver. It is not, in fact, a beaver, but the only surviving member of its own family, Aplodontiidae. Mountain beavers are known to practice coprophagy, or the eating of one’s own dung, to get the most out of the plants they eat.

Their jaw muscles are much simpler than those of most rodents, but genetic studies confirm they are not primitive, indicating that they have simplified their jaws over the course of evolution. Also, they lack the ability to produce concentrated urine, and therefore can only live in wet areas.

Central America:

The silky anteater would be up there (though it’s also found in South America). This species is an oddity among anteaters, and like the previous species has its own monotypic family. It is the smallest anteater in the world, and has a very short snout, huge claws, and a prehensile tail.

They have four digits on each limb, but only two on each have claws. These claws are big and curved enough to nearly encircle branches, hence the genus name Cyclopes (“circle foot”). They also have a sort of internal armour made of overlapping flattened ribs.

Caribbean:

I’ve decided on the tayra, though solenodons are a close second. Tayras are omnivorous mustelids which are mainly found in South America - however, they are also found on one Caribbean island, Trinidad. Their anal secretions are among the least pungent of the Mustelidae, and they live in tree hollows.

One of the most interesting things about the tayra is its caching behaviour. They’ve been observed storing unripe plantains in a special cache, and then returning some days later to eat the ripened pulp. Caching is often observed in birds and rodents, but outside those groups, it’s very rare.

South America:

Definitely the kinkajou, in my opinion. Originally thought to be a strange type of primate, it’s actually in the same family as raccoons and coatis. The kinkajou is perhaps the most fruit-loving mammal in the world - in fact, over 90% of its diet can be just fruit. Compare that to a typical mammalian frugivore, e.g. the orangutan, which is much lower at 65%.

When they’re not eating fruit, kinkajous sometimes drink the nectar of flowers. In doing so, they often become pollinators! Imagine that - a terrestrial mammalian pollinator. While that might not be too interesting to the layperson, it certainly blows my mind.

* * *

And now onto the Old World.

Northern Europe:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-19dc1b9f2284d055c6a52d671a40f355-lq)

I’m thinking the Siberian flying squirrel. Found in Finland, Estonia and Latvia (as well as Siberia, of course), this is the only species of flying squirrel in Europe, and - to my knowledge - the continent’s only gliding vertebrate. While typically thought of as tropical animals, this flying squirrel lives in Eurasia’s Arctic taiga.

Also, they are ridiculously cute with their huge eyes. They usually sleep in the holes which woodpeckers make in trees, but sometimes set up shop in man-made houses intended for birds. In these holes, they build a nest out of soft lichen.

Western Europe:

I’ll admit it, my native region has probably the most boring wildlife out of all nineteen. But if introduced species are fair game, then things get more interesting. Red-necked wallabies have been introduced to a couple of islands in the Irish Sea, such as Lambay Island and the Isle of Man.

For the full, detailed story of how they got there, you should see my answer [Gary Meaney's answer to What are your country's most interesting cases of invasive species making a home there?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-countrys-most-interesting-cases-of-invasive-species-making-a-home-there/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"). The wallabies thrive on these European islands, as they have a similar oceanic climate to Australia’s southeastern coast where the animals are naturally found.

Southern Europe:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-483001f3208444a3a45cc8387cf1b5b1-lq)

The United Kingdom is one of the last places you’d expect to find wild primates - except for humans, of course - but nevertheless they’re there. The Barbary macaque is found only in Morocco, Algeria and the Rock of Gibraltar, which is technically a part of the UK. As the world’s only tailless monkey, it’s sometimes erroneously called the Barbary or rock ape.

It’s unclear how the monkeys ended up on Gibraltar. They were once thought to be a remnant of a population ranging across Southern Europe, but that is now considered highly unlikely. Besides, Barbary macaques overall are the only macaques found west of India - another enigma. On Gibraltar, their numbers are increasing, but in Africa they’re in decline.

Eastern Europe:

The Baikal seal, hands down (All Russia is part of this region, according to the UN system). Lake Baikal, in general, is an incredibly unique ecosystem, with close to 40 endemic fish species. Baikal seals are the only entirely freshwater species of seal, though some ringed seal subspecies live in lakes, and harbour seals sometimes enter estuaries.

The primary prey of the Baikal seal is the golomyanka, an endemic genus of degenerate fish. They are fascinating in themselves, but in short - they’re translucent, have no scales, no cone cells in their eyes, no pelvic fins, no swim bladders, they have porous bones, and up to a third of their weight is fatty oil used for maintaining neutral buoyancy.

Northern Africa:

The sand cat would be a sure contender. Perhaps the most hardcore felid in the world, sand cats can withstand everything from the blazing heat of the Sahara to the cold steppes of Central Asia. This is partially due to their feet, which, instead of having hard paw-pads, are fluffy all over. This shields them from excessively hot or cold ground.

In addition to their unique feet, they have a rather unique style of locomotion. They sprint in short bursts, occasionally leaping, and hold their bellies close to the ground. When it’s too hot, sand cats retire to their burrows, which are usually originally dug by other animals.

Eastern Africa:

I was torn between tenrecs and the aye-aye, but in the end opted for the former. Tenrecs are not a species, they’re an entire family - Tenrecidae - endemic to Madagascar. Though they resemble shrews, they are closest related to Afrotherians such as golden moles. Pictured above is the lowland streaked tenrec, Hemicentetes semispinosus.

The main reason why I find these animals so interesting is convergent evolution. The basic tenrec bodyplan is remarkably shrew-like, and some have evolved spines, becoming very similar to hedgehogs, while others have taken to the water and come to resemble desmans. Tenrecidae is quite diverse for a family-level taxon, with terrestrial, arboreal, fossorial (burrowing) and aquatic species.

Western Africa:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d87452afb80fae95cec3fe3d6490824a-lq)

I’ll go for another animal which might first seem mundane, the African palm civet. It’s true that, on the outside, there’s nothing special about this species. However, it is its place in the carnivore family tree which is most fascinating, I find. Despite all appearances, the African palm civet is not a palm civet, nor is it a civet, nor is it even in the family Viverridae.

No, this species has its own family, Nandiniidae. What’s more, its most recent common ancestor with all other feliforms lived a staggering 44 million years ago! In fact, Nandiniidae is the most basal extant feliform clade of all. Perhaps it’s down to convergent evolution, or perhaps the standard bodyplan of Feliformia is just very civety. Who knows?

Middle Africa:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5b0202a1c2dc9c586b04fe21e2993add-pjlq)

The Bili apes of the DR Congo are not as monster movie-esque as they’re often made out to be, but nevertheless very interesting. This population of chimpanzees are much larger than any other chimps, standing up to 1.5 metres tall. While they have been observed eating a leopard carcass, there is as of yet no evidence that they actually hunt big cats.

Often, Bili apes construct their nests on the ground, much more in accordance with gorillas than chimpanzees. Adults usually have grey fur, and they (sometimes) have sagittal crests on their skulls, which greatly enhance bite force. When interacting with humans, their much more fearless than chimps, but nevertheless not aggressive like gorillas.

Southern Africa:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d651ed93aebb6ab016021ecbc806a2b0-lq)

I’d say golden moles. This family - Chrysochloricidae - of burrowing mammals is endemic to this region, and truly fascinating. As they spend most of their time beneath the desert sands, they have no visible eyes, and are also tailless. Instead of the usual mammalian reproductive equipment, they only have a multi-purpose cloaca, like birds and reptiles.

Their rhinarium (the wet dark patch on your dog or cat’s nose) has evolved into a hard pad for pushing through sand, and they have spade-like forelimbs for digging. They are remarkably similar in appearance to the marsupial moles of Australia, but not even closely related. Due to their very slow metabolism, they don’t need to drink water - ever - instead getting it from the insects they eat.

Central Asia:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6d737bda17a2a11f733dececd73fba72-lq)

I won’t pretend that you haven’t heard of saiga antelope, but nevertheless they’re still very interesting. These bovids are well-known for their unusual appearance, mainly due to their large, trunk-like proboscis. Unfortunately, another thing they’re famous for is mass die-offs - due to poor disease resistance, hundreds of thousands of them can die in a matter of days.

What you may not know is that saigas were once much more than a Central Asian species. In fact, their range stretched from the British Isles all the way to Canada. They’ve since gone extinct in most of that distribution. In fact, they’re now critically endangered, and their numbers have decreased by over 9 per cent since 2000.

Eastern Asia:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-acd3acefb80ed5c5af8cad53f2da377b-lq)

The binturong is mainly a Southeast Asian animal, but it is found on the fringes of China, and so qualifies as East Asian. Also known as the bearcat, this viverrid is essentially a giant palm civet, much bulkier in build. Binturongs often shake, like a wet dog, to maintain their shaggy coat, and use their huge tails for communication.

Their musk gland secretions and urine contain an aroma compound called 2AP, which gives them a characteristic popcorn smell. Sometimes, when scent-marking, binturongs will spray their urine onto their tail and then use the tail as a “paintbrush”, sweeping the branch to mark it.

Western Asia:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-273f0203545e2900c227ed00201091c8-lq)

The hamadryas baboon is probably one of the most sexually dimorphic mammals in the world. The males (left) have a shaggy, silvery coat and a big white facial ruff, while the females are only half as big and have a drab brown coat like any other baboon species. They are found on parts of the Arabian Peninsula as well as Ethiopia.

Evidently, the ancient Egyptians knew about hamadryas baboons, as they sometimes depicted the god Thoth - usually an ibis-headed man - as one in various carvings. They’re also the only species of non-human primate which are found on both the African and Asian continents.

Southern Asia:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7eae845b9baa5c8e536f70f3eb1c2e48-lq)

Again, this is a species which only barely creeps into this region, but hey, it still counts - the hog badger. Also known as the greater hog badger, its most noticeable feature is its long, pink, pig-like snout, which gives it its name. Its front claws are unusually long for a badger and white in colour.

The hog badger is also one of the largest land mustelids alive today - only the wolverine and European badger rival it. Up to 87 centimetres in length and with a maximum weight of 14 kilograms, they’re pretty big. They’re mainly found in China and Southeast Asia, but also live in parts of India, and have even been sighted as far north and inland as Mongolia.

Southeast Asia:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3d4fe83863babd66e46e123143fce0d0-lq)

It was really hard to choose for this one, since Southeast Asia - especially Indonesia - has such amazing wildlife, but eventually I chose colugos. Despite them having an entire unique order, there are only two species of colugo. Weighing up to 2 kilograms, they’re one of the world’s largest gliding animals.

Colugos are commonly also known as flying lemurs, and, while they’re not actually lemurs, the name is more correct than you’d think. That’s because it turns out that they are the closest living relatives of primates - together, the two groups form the clade Primatomorpha.

* * *

Finally, onto Oceania and Antarctica. I’ll be omitting Micronesia and Polynesia, as they have virtually no native mammal fauna.

Melanesia:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c64827d8b5abdbef79c153b90dcbe58b-lq)

I could have chosen tree kangaroos, New Guinea singing dogs or cuscuses, but I’m going to draw a wild card and say rats. No, really. The rat family (Muridae) is the only rodent group native to New Guinea, and because of that, the island’s rats have radiated to fill the niches usually taken by other small mammals.

Some of them have evolved into very shrew-looking things, while others still have become aquatic. Perhaps most cool is the genus Mallomys (pictured) \- the species of which have become among the largest rats in the world, weighing up to 2 kilograms. Some may find all this very boring, but to me this adaptive radiation is fascinating.

Australia & New Zealand:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a1dabbe9060b0a11b39e81223605e29f-lq)

The honey possum isn’t interesting because of its external appearance, but because of its ecology. It eats almost exclusively the nectar of flowers, something unique among marsupials, and like the kinkajou it’s a pollinator. Its diet is so sugary that it has a very fast metabolism, and as such has to eat very often.

Despite the name, it’s only distantly related to possums. Also, it has proportionally larger testes than literally any other animal - not kidding - as they account for nearly 5% of its bodyweight. Their sperm is huge, too; in fact, a honey possum sperm cell is bigger than a blue whale sperm cell, even though they’re one of the world’s smallest marsupials!

Antarctica:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8c81b3657541d5033bd5788868fabc0c-lq)

I’m not exactly spoilt for choice with this barren continent, but I’ll go for the crabeater seal. This rather unusual-looking pinniped is even more unusual when it opens its mouth - its teeth are almost fractal in shape, with smaller “teeth” branching off each main one. I think the best way to describe it would be that they look like Godzilla’s dorsal plates/spikes.

The reason for this is that the teeth are used as a rudimentary filter, functioning in the same way a blue whale’s baleen would. Their shape allows them to catch tiny krill as the water passes through them. Just when you thought you’d seen it all, the filter-feeding carnivoran shows up. What a world we live in.

* * *

Those are what I think are these regions’ most fascinating mammals. Obviously, many would disagree on some points and argue that other species deserve the title, but at the end of the day it’s a matter of opinion.
