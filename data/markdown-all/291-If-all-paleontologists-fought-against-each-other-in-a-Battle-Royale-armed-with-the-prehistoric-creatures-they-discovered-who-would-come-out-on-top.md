I think the other answerers have misunderstood your question - I’m assuming that each prehistoric creature fights for the paleontologist who discovered it, yes? If that’s the case, then Paul Sereno would have a good shot at winning.

He is a prolific discoverer of fossil species, and many of the new creatures he’s unearthed would fare very well in combat. Among the most formidable of his discoveries include…

*   Aerosteon, a Late Cretaceous Argentine theropod which was 9 metres long and weighed about twice as much as a small car. It had a highly advanced respiratory system.

*   Afrovenator, a megalosaur from the Middle Jurassic of North Africa. It was nearly as long as Aerosteon, although it had a significantly lighter build.

*   Deltadromeus, a theropod of mysterious classification, from the famous Kem Kem Beds. It was 8 metres long, is estimated at 1,050 kilograms in weight, and was seemingly very fast for such as a large dinosaur.

*   Eocarcharia, of Early Cretaceous Niger. 7 or 8 metres long, it had serrated, blade-like teeth (hence the name, meaning “dawn shark”) which would excel at tearing off limbs and such.

*   Erliansaurus. While it wasn’t that big (about 4 metres long), it was well-armed, having enormous curved claws on each hand. It was a plant-eating therizinosaur, and hails from Late Cretaceous China.

*   Jobaria, an 18–21 metre sauropod which lived alongside the aforementioned Afrovenator. While it wasn’t all that big for a sauropod, and didn’t have the whiplash or club-tipped tail of other species, it still had a lot of bulk and could possibly rear up on two legs.

*   Kryptops, a 110 million year-old abelisaur from the central Sahara. It was seven metres long, about two metres tall, and had very robust jaws. It’s one of the most primitive known abelisaurids.

*   Rajasaurus, one of India’s most iconic dinosaurs. An ambush predator, it was nearly seven metres long, and had a horn on its forehead for defense. It lived around the time that the Chixculub bolide struck the Earth and ended the Mesozoic. It’s one the left in the illustration below.

*   Rugops. Another Kem Kem dinosaur, it wasn’t that big - 6 metres long - and was likely a scavenger, but it was still probably a capable brawler.

*   Suchomimus, one of the largest theropods for which we can confidently estimate a body mass. Up to 11 metres long by some estimates, its jaws weren’t the most powerful, but it did have massive claws.

*   Kaprosuchus, nicknamed the “boar croc”. This terrestrial crocodilian is much smaller than the big theropods on the list, but nevertheless formidable to opponents of a similar size range.

In addition to these guys, Sereno has also discovered the small sauropod Nigersaurus, several small theropods, ceratopsians and crocodylomorphs, and the heterodontosaur Pegomastax.

He’s also discovered very significant material from the giant theropods Spinosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus, and the enormous pholidosaur Sarcosuchus. If you added those in, he’d have a very good shot at winning the clash.
