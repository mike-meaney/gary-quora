## Do hyenas have any behavioral similarities with felines for the fact that they are related to each other?

I thought about this for a while, and then I just decided; no, not really.

The closest thing I know of this is reports of hyenas “purring”. However, these have only come from a few zookeepers (Who are not hyena experts), and of the many studies on hyena vocalizations, none mention any kind of purring sound.

Recurring readers might remember me talking about what I call “the two main types of large carnivoran”. Basically, you’ve got the “feline” predators, which usually exhibit these characteristics:

*   Truncated jaws (Brachycephalic bite)
*   Retractile claws
*   Long hindlegs (for pouncing)
*   Flexible forepaws
*   Solitary lifestyle
*   Forested habitat

The only extant animals which are so-called “feline” predators are the big cats, which, with the exception of lions (Which are more like “canine” predators) and cheetahs (Which don’t fall into either group), demonstrate these things duly.

Spotted hyenas, along with wolves, dholes, lions and African wild dogs, are “canine” predators. We could classify them as having these characteristics:

*   Long snout (Telocephalic bite)
*   Blunt claws
*   Long forelegs (for running)
*   Social lifestyle
*   Open habitat

Hyenas are, ecologically, and therefore behaviourally, much more similar to canines than felines. They actually share a lot of behaviors with dogs too; including a large repertoire of vocalizations, communication with tail positions, and long-distance calls (Howls for canines, whoops for hyenas).
