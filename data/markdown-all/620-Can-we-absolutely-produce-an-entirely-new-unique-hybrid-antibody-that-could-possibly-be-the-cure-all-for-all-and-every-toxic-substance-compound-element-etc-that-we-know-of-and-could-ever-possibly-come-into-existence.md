## Can we absolutely produce an entirely new, unique hybrid antibody that could possibly be the cure-all for all and every toxic substance, compound, element, etc. that we know of and could ever possibly come into existence for all eternity?

No.

So, oversimplified, this is how antibodies work. Dangerous foreign objects have on them tiny structures called antigens. Your B cells produce antibodies which are structured such that they can bind to the antigens and neutralize the foreign object.

A one-size-fits-all antibody could not exist because there is no one binding site that could bind to every possible antigen. Each paratope (“lock”) can only be designed for one epitope (“key”).

This is not my field of expertise so please correct me if I’ve made a mistake.
