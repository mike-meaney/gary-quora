Let me get this straight; the theory of evolution is done. We’ve moved on. It was established as a scientific fact in the early 20th century and there’s not much about it we don’t understand.

We haven’t needed any more evidence for nearly a century, let alone a decade, so anything we’ve seen in the last ten years is just another insignificant addition to the enormous mountain of blatant evidence we already have.

Scientists have directly observed new species arising literally dozens of times, and on top of that there are the countless instances of microevolution in the wild and in experiments. Consider that this is just one small area of the titanic multi-faceted body of evidence for the theory, most of which had been gathered decades upon decades ago.
