It depends on when they were fossilized. Here are some insects preserved in amber from the Holocene, all of their species still extant.

Meanwhile, here's a fossil of Rhyniognatha hirsti, an insect a staggering 400 million years old.

Insects and other life forms trapped in amber can be found in any time period in between, and usually die out (geologically) soon after, due to the short lifespan of species.
