## If evolution is not about increased complexity, why does so much complexity evolve?

Increased complexity is a natural result of evolution, and indeed - in general - most forms of life get more complex as they evolve, at least when viewing things on a scale of hundreds of millions of years.

The first life form was probably a few strands of RNA encased in a phospholipid bubble. That is, as you might guess, a lot less complex than a human being, or an insect, or a modern bacterium for that matter.

I’ve never really heard someone say that “evolution is not about increased complexity”, but what I think whoever told you that meant was that evolution doesn’t necessarily mean increased complexity.

For example, this glass sponge, with its intricate tiny scaffolding of siliceous spicules:

Is, from a cladistic standpoint, more “primitive” than this Placozoan, an amorphous, microscopic blob, essentially a multicellular amoeba:

That’s because the Placozoan is secondarily simplified; it is, in fact, less complex than its ancestors because it evolved to be that way. As a matter of fact, there is a fairly recent new hypothesis that Placozoans and other animals evolved from transmissible cancerous tumours, like Devil Facial Tumour Disease! More on that here: [From tumors to species: a SCANDAL hypothesis](https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13062-019-0233-1 "biologydirect.biomedcentral.com")

Another example is modern crocodilians. They are chiefly ambush predators and spend much of their day lying in wait. This isn’t particularly energy-expensive, as you’d imagine, so they make do with being cold-blooded.

However, there is evidence that this was not always true. Crocodilians, like birds, have a four-chambered heart generally associated with warm-blooded, endothermic animals. The fossil record also supports this notion. This, for example, is Fasolasuchus, an early crocodile-relative and a highly active predator as big as a T Rex:

Lastly, consider this fact: 800 million years from now, it is likely that the sun’s activities will mean that the only life on Earth will be microbial. You might say “Ah, but bacteria will never colonize the stars”, but remember that even a single one of us carries tens of trillions of them. Wherever we go, they will follow, and there they will outlast us.
