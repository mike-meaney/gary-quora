In a way, yes.

This is Trigodon, a relative of the better-known Toxodon. It’s not an equid (horse), but if you count a unicorn as an ungulate with a single horn protruding from its forehead, then yes.

Trigodon lived in the late Miocene of South America, where it roamed alongside giant crocodiles.

There’s also Elasmotherium, whose thick, heavy horn gives it a less unicorn-like appearance, but nevertheless has a forehead-mounted horn.

Elasmotherium is an odd-toed ungulate, so it’s also a bit more closely related to horses.
