Carpocyon, an extinct member of the dog family which was apparently a specialized frugivore, or fruit-eater. Its generic name even means “fruit dog”. It stayed around a while, too, lasting 13 million years from 23 to 10 mya.

Xenosmilus, perhaps the weirdest cat in history. It was so terribly muscular that it outweighed modern lions and tigers easily - in fact, it was built almost like a bear, and may have even walked on plantigrade feet to support its weight.

However, its bite is what really takes the cake. It’s been nicknamed the “cookie-cutter cat”, because its teeth lined up in one homogenous row. These teeth were triangular and serrated, like a shark’s, and a Xenosmilus attack would not involve stabbing or strangling like a normal sabertooth, but rather a messy tearing off of huge chunks, letting shock and blood loss do the rest.

Kolponomos was an early bear, and - much like a polar bear - semi-aquatic, giving it the nickname “otter bear”. It actually might not be in the bear family; it could be a procyonid, related to raccoons. In any case, it spent much of its time in the water and had huge molars for crushing shellfish.

Then there’s Ferinestrix vorax, essentially a prehistoric scaled-up version of a badger. Anybody who’s been bitten by a badger will know that this thing’s jaws must have been terrifying. Using its size and strength, Ferinestrix could well have muscled kills off sabertooth cats and bone-crushing borophagine dogs.

For a different kind of frightening beast, here’s Dinopithecus - as far as we know, the largest monkey of all time. It was most closely related to baboons and like them was probably omnivorous, only it was as big as a man.

Speaking of men, it coexisted with our early australopithecine ancestors, and may well have eaten them. I do wonder if they hunted in huge swarms like modern baboons… that would be stupefyingly scary.

Lastly, I offer you a herbivore, and a very recent one at that (early Homo sapiens doubtless encountered it on the African plains). Rusingoryx looked, superficially, quite similar to a normal wildebeest. However, its nasal cavity was domed and contained a complex passageway which allowed it to “honk” like a crested dinosaur, even producing infrasound.

And so, those are 6 varieties of extinct mammal which I think deserve more attention than they get.
