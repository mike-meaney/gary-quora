Dang that’s tricky.

There’s Jotus remus, the spider which has feathery paddles on its feet. It hides behind leaves and waves these at its potential mate in a bizarre and amusing courtship dance.

Then there are peacock spiders, jumping spiders which have vibrant flaps extending from their abdomen which give them their name.

Many species of spider fall into a group called “ant spiders”. They mimic ants, even lifting up their front legs so that they look like antennae. Some live in groups, pretending to be whole colonies.

Here’s a ladybird spider, Paraplectana, which has a red “shell” covered in black spots, making it look like… well, a ladybird.

The long-horned orb weaver, Macrathana, is rightly named.

There are also bird dung spiders, which mimic bird droppings with often great accuracy:

You may have also heard the news that Toxeus magnus, a jumping spider, was recently discovered to produce “milk” to nurse its young.
