Tiger, no question about it.

A bull is basically a smaller, tamer version of an Indian water buffalo, known as “dinner” in Tigrish.

What’s more, tigers will not only kill wild water buffalo, but steal domestic ones right under people’s noses.

It seems like these water buffaloes aren’t shaping up to be much of a challenge, don’t you think? Maybe we should but them up against the most powerful bovid in India. Surely they’d be no match for the Gaur.

I take it back. A tiger would slaughter an adult gaur too. What about the largest land mammal in Asia? You guessed it. Not even elephants are safe from the tiger.

And those are just Bengal tigers. Siberian tigers are bigger, stronger and more durable. So, after that, I think it’s safe to say that tiger wins, hands down.
