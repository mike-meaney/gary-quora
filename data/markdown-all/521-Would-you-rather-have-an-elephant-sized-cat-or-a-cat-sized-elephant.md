I’m gonna go against the crowd and say…

Elephant-sized cat

First of all, I hope we all agree; big cats look pretty damn gorgeous.

Their thick fur, muscular builds, and markings make them - in my opinion - some of the most beautiful animals in the world.

Scale that up to the size of an elephant; and you get a giant big cat - just as gorgeous, but more impressive. If it can be a prehistoric cat - even better.

Imagine an elephant-size one of these:

Or even this:

They would be dangerous (And perhaps biomechanically implausible), but beautiful all the same.
