## We've only explored 7% of our ocean floor. What is the possibility that there is an animal longer than the lion's mane jellyfish and a blue whale?

Yes.

The bootlace worm, Lineus longissimus, is a type of nemertean worm which may be able to grow to about 60 metres in length, twice the length of most blue whales:

Quite the handsome character, isn’t he?

Now, I say “may” because nemerteans display great elasticity in terms of expandable bodies, so 60 metres may not be the natural length of the animal.

Of course, that 60 doesn’t count the length of its eversible proboscis…
