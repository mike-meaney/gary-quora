A group of elephants is usually a herd, but can also be called a parade or a memory. As said in the answer below, you call a group of sloths a sleuth.

Even though tigers are usually solitary animals (So are sloths, come to think of it.), there are a couple of names for it. Theyâ€™re called a streak, or an ambush (When hunting).
