## If cows contribute to climate change when releasing methane, does this mean that their wild cousins (buffaloes, bisons, etc.) do the same too? If so, then what is the solution?

All ruminants produce methane gas, as it is a waste product of the symbiotic bacteria in their guts. Indeed, you and I produce methane too. However, there are two reasons why cattle are the biggest culprits.

Population size

There are about 1.5 billion domestic cattle in the world, making them one of the most abundant vertebrate species in the world. There are also considerable numbers of domestic water buffalo (about 175 million), though some consider them as cattle too. In any case, domestic bovines far outclass wild ones in terms of population size.

Diet

Nowadays, many cows aren’t fed naturally occurring flora, but a species of grass called Lolium perenne, commonly known as perennial ryegrass. Think of L. perenne as the McDonald’s of grasses - efficient and easy to produce, but with poor nutritional value. As it’s harder to digest, the cows’ gut bacteria spend more time breaking it down and therefore produce more methane.

To combat this, we could start feeding cows a diverse diet of wild grasses and flowers, which are much more nutrient-rich. Perennial ryegrass is far more cost-efficient, as it grows fast and is highly resistant to invasives, but even partially incorporating wild pasture could make a difference to methane in the atmosphere.
