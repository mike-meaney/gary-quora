Great question! Here are my top ten.

*   Tsingy de Bemahara National Park. Found in northwest Madagascar, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is famous for its extremely jagged landscape. Its endless cathedral-like spires of limestone have been gouged out by rain and groundwater over millennia. Because the spires are so inaccessible, they often contain endemic species unique to each rock formation.

*   Moremi Game Reserve. Technically not a national park (it was designated a game reserve so the native Bushmen could continue living there) but still worth mentioning. It’s part of the Okavango Delta, the world’s largest inland river delta. Its floodplains, lagoons and swamps eventually peter out and evaporate in the Kalahari desert of Botswana.

*   Gorongosa National Park. This Mozambican park might seem fairly standard at first glance, but its history is what sets it apart. In the ‘80s, during the country’s decade-long civil war, it was heavily bombed and overrun by soldiers. Large mammal populations decreased by 95%! However, thanks to tireless restoration efforts, its ecosystem is once again flourishing.

*   Nairobi National Park. This is likely the world’s only national park contained entirely within a city - a city of 4.5 million, no less. Here you can go on a safari with a futuristic skyline as a backdrop - a huge railway bridge even runs right through the park. It is rich in wildlife, although most of the large animals were reintroduced by humans.

*   Namib-Naukluft National Park. This positively enormous park in Namibia is famous for its endless red sands, flat clay pans and - most of all - its photogenic dead trees, which are more than 500 years old. Cold winds blowing in from the Atlantic also create the world’s tallest sand dunes, one of which is nearly 400 m tall! There are also a pair of mega-dunes called Big Daddy and Big Mama.

*   Rwenzori Mountains National Park. This Ugandan area protects Africa’s highest mountain range, the Rwenzori Mountains. Some are even snow-capped, and have glaciers, despite being on the equator. To withstand the cold, many plants have grown to be outlandishly huge - giant lobelias and heathers the size of trees. There are also a lot of endemic animals, especially birds.

(Have a look [here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-underrated-mountain-ranges/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") for a more detailed rundown)

*   Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve. Again, not really a national park but fascinating nonetheless. It’s in the Seychelles, which once formed an isolated continent along with Madagascar and India. The Seychelles remains remote, so its primitive Cretaceous flora was not replaced by more advanced species. In the Vallée, forests are dominated by palm trees, unlike anywhere else in the world.

*   Ngorongoro Conservation Area. Again I’m stretching the definition of national park here, but it doesn’t really matter for practical purposes. This Tanzanian preserve is nestled within a huge basalt crater, the Ngorongoro Crater, which is what makes it so unique. This caldera is the remnant of a huge volcano which has since been eroded away into a shallow bowl.

*   Lake Malawi National Park. As the name suggests, this one is found on the southern end of Lake Malawi, the world’s fifth-largest lake by volume. It is home to more fish species than any other lake on Earth, at more than 1,000! 700 of these are from one family alone, the cichlids. It’s also really interesting because it’s a breeding ground for lake flies, which form immense swarms hundreds of metres tall.

*   Bale Mountains National Park. Found way up in the towering Ethiopian Highlands, this national park has a suitably alien landscape. It contains vast moorlands dotted with huge, 6 metre tall lobelias. It’s chiefly known for being a stronghold for Ethiopian wolves, the world’s rarest canine. It also contains the earliest evidence of human settlement at high altitude, in the form of 30,000 year old artifacts.
