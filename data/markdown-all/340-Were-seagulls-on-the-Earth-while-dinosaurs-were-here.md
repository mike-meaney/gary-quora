Assuming you mean non-avian dinosaurs, no. The gull family appeared about 30 million years ago in the Rupelian stage of the Oligocene, possibly in Europe as many early gull fossils have been found there.

However, the niche which seagulls fill today was not empty during the Mesozoic. In the Late Cretaceous, North America was bisected by a huge waterway known as the Western Interior Seaway. This sea harboured a rich ecosystem of ancient creatures, among them the dinosaur Ichthyornis.

Ichthyornis dispar was probably similar in appearance and lifestyle to modern seagulls. It wasn’t technically a bird, lying just outside Aves, but a modern observer would never be able to distinguish it from one.

At the same time and place, there was another group of bird-like dinosaurs, the Hesperornithes. They would have been the Cretaceous equivalent of cormorants or penguins, and had vaguely grebe/loon-like features. Thought to be flightless, they inhabited both freshwater and marine ecosystems.

Pterosaurs also probably filled some seabird-like roles in Mesozoic ecosystems. Some species in the ornithocheirid family were likely primarily fish-eaters, and nyctosaurids such as Alcione (the black ones in the image below) have wings which seem to be adapted for diving, like modern gannets and tropicbirds.

So in short, in the time of the non-avian dinosaurs there definitely were animals which filled the roles of gulls and other modern seabirds, but they weren’t birds themselves. It is interesting how many parallels you can draw between the ecosystems of then and now.
