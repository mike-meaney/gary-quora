Without scientists, how do you think these would’ve been designed?

What about these?

Or this? Combining atomic nuclei is not the work of engineers alone.

Allan Savory is doing wonders fighting desertification, and he’s an ecologist - a scientist.

It was Sergey and Nikita Zimov, both geophysicists, who devised the ingenious idea of Pleistocene Park, which could stop the melting of permafrost and subsequent release of greenhouse gases.

Geneticists are devising ideas on genetically engineering plants to absorb carbon dioxide and store it for long periods of time ([https://scialert.net/fulltextmobile/?doi=ajbkr.2011.337.344](https://scialert.net/fulltextmobile/?doi=ajbkr.2011.337.344 "scialert.net")). This is just one of scores of possible solutions, all the brainchildren of scientists.

As far as fighting climate change is concerned, scientists - along with engineers - are leading the charge.
