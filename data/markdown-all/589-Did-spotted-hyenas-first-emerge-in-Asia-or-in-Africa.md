The simplest answer I can give you is that we don’t know.

The Finnish paleontologist Björn Kurtén argues for an Asiatic origin for the species, proposing that the Plio-Pleistocene hyena Crocuta sivalensis, of the Siwaliks, is a likely ancestor.

However, I provide two lines of evidence which seemingly contradict this claim. For one thing, we have African Crocuta species which are just as old; for example Crocuta eturono and Crocuta dietrichi.

Secondly, according to this article - [The Taxonomic Identity of the Type Specimen of Crocuta sivalensis (Falconer, 1867) | Request PDF](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256295147_The_Taxonomic_Identity_of_the_Type_Specimen_of_Crocuta_sivalensis_Falconer_1867 "www.researchgate.net") - Crocuta sivalensis is actually not related to Crocuta at all but in fact a type of Pliocrocuta, a different genus altogether.

Pliocrocuta perrieri, the species to which C. sivalensis now apparently belongs

So, in short, the question is still unresolved. I will edit my answer if I encounter any further research on spotted hyena evolution which might shed light on the subject.

Thanks for the A2A.
