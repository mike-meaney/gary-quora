## What if there was another intelligent species on Earth that lived before humans and went to colonize the stars before the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs?

I’ve heard some speculations and musing on the nature of an extinct Permian sophont.

This is Lystrosaurus:

There are a few species, but members of the genus can be found across the entire world. Some have speculated that their huge range and ubiquity was because they were the livestock of an intelligent species. Looking at their anatomy, they certainly would fit the bill for pastoralists; their herbivorous grazing diet(of ferns, not grass, of course), lots of meat, and seemingly docile form would make a good livestock animal. In many ways, they’re quite similar to pigs.

There’s also a creature from the Permian called Suminia:

(They probably weren’t covered in vibrissae, but just pretend it’s furry or scaly)

It is not hard to “evolve” this in your mind into an almost, monkey- or lemur-like form. I myself doubt this, but what if, they speculate, it followed a similar evolutionary path to the first hominids? The existence of another, unrelated humanoid species to me seems extremely improbable, but at least it’s “possible”.

This is all very speculative and very unlikely, but it at least makes a humanoid therapsid farming Lystrosaurs for their meat a little more plausible. A disaster on the scale of the Permian extinction is among the only things that could wipe out a globally-ranging sophont like us.

Thanks for asking, I hope I answered well.
