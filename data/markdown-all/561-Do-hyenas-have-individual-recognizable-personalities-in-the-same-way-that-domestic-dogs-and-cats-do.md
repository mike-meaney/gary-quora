Thanks for your A2A.

Yes, they certainly do. The anthropologist Marcus Baynes-Rock, in his book Among the Bone-Eaters, befriended many members of a hyena clan in Harar, Ethiopia, and could easily differentiate the personalities of those hyenas. There were trusting ones, skittish ones, aggressive ones, non-conformists, and ones who “wore \[their\] heart on \[their\] sleeve”.

Generally, animals having different personalities is a consequence of sociality. It helps to have a good mix of characters when you’re in a group.

In a paper by the famous hyena expert Kay E. Holekamp, et al., three personality traits were examined and the study found that each individual hyena did indeed have unique personalities. The traits were boldness, aggressiveness and socialibility.

The authors also explain how having these personalities increases their “fitness” and gives them a selective advantage:

> Particularly aggressive females were more successful in raising their offspring to reproductive maturity than less aggressive females . . . for low-ranking hyenas, gaining feeding tolerance via sociability may significantly enhance reproductive success . . . highly social hyenas lived longer than those that were less social, but selection on boldness was stabilizing, favoring hyenas with intermediate boldness values that balance the benefits of risky behaviour against risks of injury and death.

Again, thanks for asking, it’s a very interesting question. Also, here’s a link to the paper here: [Variation among free-living spotted hyenas in three personality traits in: Behaviour Volume 153 Issue 13-14 Year 2016](https://brill.com/view/journals/beh/153/13-14/article-p1665_8.xml "brill.com")
