Quite a lot, actually. During the last ice age, sea levels were lower, so some Caribbean islands were significantly bigger - especially Cuba. These larger islands had more resources on them, so could sustain ecosystems of much larger animals.

There were many different types of unusual flightless birds. There was Ornimegalonyx, also known as the Cuban giant owl. Weighing up to 30 kilograms, it was the largest owl ever to live, and couldn’t fly. It stood more than a metre tall.

There was Grus cubensis, the Cuban flightless crane. Living alongside the owl, it’s the only known crane in history which has evolved flightlessness, and was also significantly larger than its modern relatives.

On the island of Jamaica, there was even a flightless bird of prey - Caracara tellustris, the Jamaican caracara. Related to falcons, it was evidently terrestrial and probably flightless, and it lived a similar lifestyle to the secretarybird of today’s African savanna.

To the right of the giant caracara above is the Caribbean’s weirdest flightless bird - Xenicibis, the Jamaican ibis. Not only is it unique because it’s one of two known flightless ibis species (the other being Apteribis of Pleistocene Hawaii), but it had curious bony outgrowths on its wing bones. These were actually clubs, which would have been used as weapons in fights between males.

Another thing the Caribbean islands had going for them during the Pleistocene was giant birds of prey. For starters, you had Woodward’s eagle - Amplibuteo - which was also found in North America. It was one of the largest birds of prey of all time, as long as New Zealand’s extinct Haast’s eagle but with an even greater wingspan.

Then there was Titanohierax, also known as the Bahaman titan-hawk. As its name suggests, it was a hawk, but it was as big as the largest eagles of today. As its name doesn’t suggest, it didn’t just live in the Bahamas, also inhabiting the islands of Cuba and Hispaniola.

Another giant hawk from this time and place is Buteogallus borrasi, which was so large it was originally thought to be an eagle when it was discovered. However, it was a member of the buteonines, sometimes known as crab-hawks. It was one third larger than the largest of its modern relatives.

Lastly, we have another giant owl, possibly flightless. This is Tyto pollens, which - standing a metre tall - wasn’t much smaller than the aforementioned Ornimegalonyx. But while the latter was a wood-owl, in the Strigidae family, this one was a member of the barn owls, Tytonidae.

During the Ice Age, the Caribbean archipelago was a veritable New Zealand of huge, weird birds. Living alongside them were a whole host of other fascinating creatures, such as dwarf ground sloths, rodents the size of bears, and an extinct, endemic group of monkeys. It’s such a pity that these animals are no longer around today.
