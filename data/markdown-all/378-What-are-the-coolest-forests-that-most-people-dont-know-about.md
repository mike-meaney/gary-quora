Interesting question! The first one that jumped to mind is the Crooked Forest, or Krzywy Las, a grove of pine trees found in northwestern Poland. There are around 400 trees, planted there in 1930 or thereabouts, and they all bend in a bizarre way.

The bases of the trunks all bend to the north, deviating horizontally up to 3 metres from the main trunk. The eery part is that no one really knows how or why this happened. It was most likely the result of human intervention, but beyond that it’s unexplained.

Strangely enough, there’s an uncannily similar pine tree grove not too far away, in Kaliningrad. Kaliningrad Oblast is a section of Russia completely disconnected from the main part of the nation, similar to Alaska and the USA. The forest in question is known as the Dancing Forest.

Rather than bending uniformly, the pines of the Dancing Forest twist and convolute in irregular ways, forming rings, spirals and even heart shapes. Again, the cause of this distortion is shrouded in mystery. The leading hypothesis is that caterpillars damaged the shoots of the trees when they were very young, skewing their direction of growth.

Continuing the theme of strangely shaped trees, near the town of El Valle de Antón, Panama, you can find a forest of square-shaped trees, or Arboles Cuadrados. Here, the species Quararibea asterolepis grows, notable for the boxy, angular cross section of its trunk.

There’s nothing awfully mysterious about this one - they just happen to have evolved to be square - but it’s an interesting place all the same.

Now I’ll mention a forest which is just as eerie as the first two, but for altogether different reasons. Aokigahara Forest, found in central Honshu, Japan, is notorious for its high levels of suicide. In 2002 alone, more than 100 people took their own lives in this forest.

This is largely attributed to a 1961 Japanese novel called Tower of Waves, in which the protagonists commit suicide in the forest. However, the death association is much older; it’s thought that centuries ago elderly relatives would have been left to die here. There are now signs imploring visitors not to kill themselves.

I should add that local officials are trying hard to dispel the tragic reputation of Aokigahara. To its credit, it offers spectacular views of Mount Fuji, has many caves, and is home to plenty of interesting wildlife. It’s a pristine natural area, despite the grisly association with suicide.

Lastly, let’s look at the “sunken forest” of Lake Kaindy. Found in the mountainous southeast of Kazkahstan, Kaindy was created when a 1911 landslide cut off part of a river, causing it to swell and fill the forested valley. However, the spruce trees were not swept away in the flood, and though they died they still stand starkly in the lake.

Above the surface, the trunks are bare and white, but beneath it they’re festooned with algae and other aquatic life. The water of the lake itself is very clear, and stained a green colour due to the surrounding limestone rock dissolving. The landslide that created the lake was the result of a brutal earthquake which killed nearly half a thousand.

So, there are five different forests around the world which I find especially interesting and beautiful. I hope you all enjoyed reading.
