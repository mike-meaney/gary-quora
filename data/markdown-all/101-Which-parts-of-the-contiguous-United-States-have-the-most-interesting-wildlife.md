The Channel Islands of California have a unique selection of flora and fauna which really don’t get enough love, in my opinion. Despite being a stone’s throw away from some of America’s largest cities, they retain a diverse array of wildlife, some of which is found nowhere else.

There are endemic species of birds, and even mammals, which is surprising for such small islands. Here are some of the amazing animals unique to the archipelago:

*   The island fox, a tiny canine which experienced insular dwarfism as it evolved. Despite there being six subspecies, it has a bizarre lack of genetic diversity not seen in other animals.

*   The island spotted skunk, a subspecies of the Western spotted skunk found on the mainland. It is distinguished from its continental cousin by a shorter tail, smoother fur and a different colour pattern.

*   The ashy storm petrel, a small, fish-eating seabird. Strictly speaking, it isn’t entirely endemic, as it’s found on the nearby Farallon Islands and Mexico’s Coronado Islands.

*   The island scrub jay. This colourful bird is found only on Santa Cruz island, and differs from its mainland relatives by its smaller size (insular dwarfism again) and longer beak, which is adapted to crack open acorns.

*   The San Clemente loggerhead shrike, a subspecies of the loggerhead shrike. As a highly localized population, it’s long been at risk of extinction - in 1998, there were as little as 14 individuals alive. Currently there are around 40 mated pairs on the island.

In terms of reptiles and amphibians, there are a few more endemics, such as the island night lizard and the Channel Islands slender salamander. And those are just some of the wild endemic animals - there are actually two breeds of livestock originating from the Channel islands; a sheep and a goat.

Furthermore, there are plenty of plants found only in the archipelago, some of which are under threat of extinction due to invasive flora. Santa Cruz is one of only two places you can find the iconic but critically endangered Torrey pine.

The other location - San Diego - is notably further away from the islands than you’d expect. This is because the San Diego area and what would become the Channel Islands were once right next to each other, but the Pacific Plate has since drifted northwest, taking the pines with it.

Also, the islands are rich in non-endemic wildlife; especially in the surrounding waters. They lie in the path of the cold California Current, where untapped nutrients from the deep are forced up to the surface. This phenomenon is known as upwelling, and it creates bountiful marine ecosystems.

There are several species of whale which congregate off the Channel Islands, including humpback whales, grey whales, blue whales, and possibly even North Pacific right whales, one of the world’s most endangered cetaceans.

Other marine mammals found in the area include sea otters, California sea lions, Steller sea lions, Guadalupe fur seals, northern elephant seals, and harbour seals, pictured below.

On some of the islands, the beaches host huge colonies of the California sea lions, which often intermingle with elephant seals.

So, you’ve got a fairly little-known cluster of islands, surrounded by rich kelp forests, home to a wealth of marine mammals, two unique breeds of livestock, groves of a super-rare conifer tree, and even an endemic species of canid.

The wildlife might not be as flashy as that of Yellowstone or the Everglades, but I still think it’s a good candidate for this question, because it’s so damn interesting. Thanks everyone for reading, have a great day.
