That isn’t a dinosaur? For that we’d need to find the outgroup to Dinosauria, the clade which lies immediately outside it. In the dinosaurs’ case, it’d be the Silesaurids.

Silesauridae was a family which contained 12 genera of almost-dinosaurs. The type species, pictured above, is Silesaurus. It lived roughly 230 million years ago, in what is now Poland.

Of course, it’s long extinct today. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs that aren’t dinosaurs are crocodilians.
