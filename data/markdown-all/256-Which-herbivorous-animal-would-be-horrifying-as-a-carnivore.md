Interesting question. Here is my suggestion;

Kangaroos.

*   A kick from a red kangaroo can relieve an opponent of his internal organs. One kangaroo who kicked a woman burst open her breast.

*   For short distances they can move at speeds of up to 70 kilometres per hour.

*   In addition to their feet, they have huge two-inch claws on their hands:

*   They are social and travel in groups called mobs. The word takes on a new meaning when they want to eat you.

*   Kangaroos are damn jacked.

Interestingly enough, there were carnivorous macropods in prehistory. I give you Propleopus, killer kangaroo of the Plio-Pleistocene.
