## How does the unearthing of the lower jaw, teeth and other bones of a new species, Simbakubwa kutokaafrik, in Kenya change our understanding of lions?

It doesn't. Simbakubwa kutoaafrika is not even closely related to lions, despite its name. Every time I see an article calling it a “giant lion” my eye twitches.

So, what we do know is that Simbakubwa was a hyaenodont, probably the largest known hyaenodont in fact. Hyaenodontidae was a family of often huge carnivores characterized by their bone-crushing dentition and slim build.

Now, we don’t exactly know what hyaenodontids are. They were traditionally classified as part of the order Creodonta, the sister taxon of modern carnivorans, but it’s looking like Creodonta is actually multiple unrelated groups.

The most recent studies place one family of creodonts, oxyaenids, as primitive Laurasiatheres (a diverse group of mammals including bats, carnivores and ungulates), while hyaenodonts themselves are close relatives of pangolins.

Whatever the case, Simbakubwa kutoaafrika had nothing to do with lions, or any other felines.
