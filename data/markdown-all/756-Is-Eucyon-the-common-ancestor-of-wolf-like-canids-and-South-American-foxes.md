As far as I know, it is only the ancestor of the genus Canis, but not Lycalopex. Actually, even that proposal is debated.

It's possible that it is the common ancestor of all species in the subtribe Canina, but I highly doubt it evolved into all Cerdocyonines as well, as I'm pretty sure Canina is a clade, not a grade.
