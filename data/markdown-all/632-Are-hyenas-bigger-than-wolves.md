There are different species of hyena, and different varieties of wolf, but if we look at the smallest and largest members of the two taxa, yes.

The smallest Hyaenid is the aardwolf, Proteles cristata.

The smallest wolf is the Chihahua, Canis lupus familiaris:

Aardwolves weigh 7.9 kilograms, while chihahuas weigh up to 3.

The largest hyena is the spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta:

And the largest wolf is the Great Dane, also Canis lupus familiaris.

Now, the largest great danes are a good bit heavier than spotted hyenas, but on average, they’re about the same size - with hyenas being 65 kg, and Great Danes being about 40–91.

Now, if we include extinct members, hyenas are definitely bigger. Even Canis dirus, the famous (and overrated) dire wolf, weighs about as much as a spotted hyena, but the monstrous Pachycrocuta is a lot bigger than almost any canid:
