## Are there any examples of a non-endemic species filling an ecological niche left behind by an extinct species?

Certainly. My favourite instance of this would probably be the dingoes of Australia.

Dingoes are not, as you might expect, a naturally evolved type of animal. They are thought to have descended from domestic dogs in Southeast Asia which lived around 4,000 years ago. Though they live in the wild, they exist because of humans.

In other words, dingoes are an introduced species in Australia, not a native one. Why then, are they protected? The answer lies in the country’s prehistoric past…

Before the first Aboriginal people arrived in Australia, the landmass had a flourishing ecosystem of large herbivores, and large carnivores which preyed on them. This included marsupial lions, marsupial leopards, huge monitor lizards, terrestrial crocodiles and very large snakes.

However, all of the big predators were wiped out, likely due to overhunting. Most of the plant-eating megafauna was lost too, but some survived; kangaroos, most notably.

So, for millennia, the surviving herbivores like kangaroos would have likely had no natural predators, at least in the case of fully grown individuals. Thus, dingoes are essentially playing the role of the extinct native carnivores by preying on them.

So, despite technically being alien to Australia, the dingo is a useful animal to have around.
