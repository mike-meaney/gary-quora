## Are there any records of the Greeks, Egyptians, or ancient Romans finding dinosaur fossils? Was there any record of what they thought they were?

There are certainly many records of ancient civilizations - in particular those of the Mediterranean - encountering fossilized animals, and many theories as well; some of them solid, others more dubious. These are the most “verified” instances I could find.

In the eastern Aegean Sea, there is an island known as Samos. In the third century BC, the Greek Euphorion allegedly wrote that, in days of old;

> There appeared in the island animals of gigantic size, which were savage and dangerous to man to approach, and they were called Neades.

The fossils of many large mammals from the late Miocene epoch have been excavated on the island of Samos, including the huge giraffe relative Samotherium (pictured) and a large monitor lizard. It’s quite possible that encounters with these fossilized remains inspired the myth of the Neades.

A site on Samos - named Panaima, meaning “bloodbath” - was also said to be where the god Dionysus once fought a battle with the Amazons, with an army of war elephants. At that very same location, we have unearthed the bones of mastodons from the Pleistocene. Mastodons were closely related to elephants.

The Romans described a tribe known as the Teutons, which was ruled by a giant king known as Teutobochus. Much later, in 1613, a 10-metre long stone tomb was unearthed, inscribed with the words Theutobochus Rex, and inside was a giant skeleton. Finally, in the 1980s, a French zoologist identified the bones as those of an ancient elephant relative known as Deinotherium:

At the Ancient Egyptian city of Qau El-Kebir, vast collections of fossils - collectively weighing some three tons \- have been found, wrapped in linen or in tombs hewn of rock. These would have been brought from the Nile to shrines of the war god Seth.

According to one paper I read:

> Many were noted as hippopotamus but there were a range of mammals, reptiles \[and\] fish . . . is possible that the fossils were a form of local offerings to Seth, perhaps functioning in a similar fashion to the use of animal mummies.

Moving on, another well-known case is that of the “Monster of Troy” vase. This vase, excavated in the Greek city of Corinth, depicts the Homeric legend of Heracles (known to the Romans as Hercules) rescuing the princess Hesione from a monster.

As you can see, it bears very clear resemblances to a skull. The most popular theory is that it is inspired by the skull of some extinct member of the giraffe family - quite possibly the aforementioned Samotherium. The giraffid’s skull is undeniably similar in shape, however, other details of the depiction have caused some to doubt this.

One study argued that it could not be a giraffid - or a mammal of any description - on count of its sharp teeth and sclerotic rings (bony rings found in the eyes of many vertebrates - except for mammals and crocodilians). It concluded that the skull was more likely that of a reptile, perhaps not even an extinct one. So, the debate continues.

Now, stepping much further back in time, we look at the Mongolian site known as the Flaming Cliffs.

Famous as a rich fossil bed, the Stone Age inhabitants of this area are known as “dune dwellers”. They weren’t Greeks, Romans or Egyptians as the question mentioned, but I feel this is relevant and you’ll find it interesting. In any case, fragments of dinosaur eggs - fashioned into beads - have been found at dune dweller archaeological sites, and were probably worn as jewelry.

The last thing I’ll mention is the mythical dragons of the Siwalik Hills, India. When the Greek philosopher Apollonius of Tyana visited this branch of the Himalayas, he wrote that:

> Dragons of enormous size and variety infest northern India . . . The countryside is full of them and no mountain ridge was without one.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed, the Siwalik Hills are rich in fossils. Among the ancient creatures which have been dug up here include the colossal giraffe Sivatherium, the elephant Stegodon, and the largest tortoise in history - the two-tonne Megalochelys atlas. Sivatherium is pictured below.

It's also said that men would hunt for dragon skulls in the Siwaliks to extract the gems they contained. According to one article, selenite and calcite crystals commonly form on fossils in this area.

There are actually many, many more reports from ancient times of fossils being mistaken for giants' bones and mythical creatures possibly inspired by prehistoric remains. However, most of those are very hard to find information on, so I've included the best ones here.

Thank you very much for reading - this is a topic which I find fascinating, and I hope you do too.
