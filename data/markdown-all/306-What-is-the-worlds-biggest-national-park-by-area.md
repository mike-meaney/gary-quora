Technically, it would be the Northeast Greenland National Park. This giant occupies some 972,000 square kilometres, and is therefore bigger than the entire nation of Nigeria. It’s also the world’s northernmost national park, and the second-biggest national subdivision in the world after Nunavut, Canada.

Here, you can find a wide variety of seals, cetaceans, birds and land mammals, including an estimated 40% of the world’s musk oxen. However, to me its most fascinating inhabitant is the Greenland wolf, a subspecies of gray wolf. There are only about 200 of them left (most of them in this park).

However, if we look at protected reserves as a whole, rather than just national parks (which have a rather specific and often irrelevant definition), there are several places which outsize Northeast Greenland. The largest protected area in the world is known as Marae Moana.

Marae Moana, found off the self-governing Cook Islands of New Zealand, stretches across some 1.976 million square kilometers. This is mainly ocean, but there are many tiny islands it encompasses. Home to some 600 species of fish and 136 species of corals, it is very similar in area to Mexico.

There are several other enormous marine protected areas - in fact, of the 20 largest ones, only one (Northeast Greenland NP) is terrestrial, and besides that all but six are in the Pacific Ocean.

After Marae Moana, the largest ones are the Ross Sea Marine Protected Area off Antarctica, at 1.5 million square kilometres, and the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which includes part of Hawaii, which is a similar size.
