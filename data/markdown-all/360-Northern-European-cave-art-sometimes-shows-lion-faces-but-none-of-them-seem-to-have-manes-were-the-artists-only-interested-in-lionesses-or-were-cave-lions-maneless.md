## Northern European cave art sometimes shows lion faces but none of them seem to have manes - were the artists only interested in lionesses, or were cave lions maneless?

Quite possibly the latter, as some lions in cave paintings do appear to be males:

This one is from the Chauvet-Pont-d’Arc Cave, famous for its cave paintings of lions and other Pleistocene megafauna. Now, with only one confirmed sample, this isn’t conclusive - many modern male lions are in fact maneless - but you’d expect that there’d be at least one maned one among the many paintings.

Let’s look at, then, why we think male African lions can be born without manes. The existing hypotheses are that:

1.  It’s an adaptation to hot climate. A shaggy mane, of course, is not ideal in blistering heat, and this paper - [Developmental Effects of Climate on the Lion's Mane ( Panthera leo )](https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/87/2/193/866474 "academic.oup.com") - found a positive correlation between the extent of the mane and local climate.
2.  It’s an adaptation to dense thicket. In places such as Kenya’s Tsavo or Samburu regions, where maneless males are common, the ground is covered in dense, thorny bushes, which would be hard to slip through with a great big mane.
3.  It’s a side-effect of high testosterone. This interesting proposal was suggested by researchers who found that Tsavo’s maneless males controlled fairly large groups of females, throwing into question the idea that manes are for sexual selection.

How does this compare to what we know about Eurasian cave lions? The hot climate is definitely out of the question, because when the Chauvet paintings were made, the Earth was colder than it had been in tens of millions of years.

What about hypothesis number two? We do happen to have a good approximation of what vegetation zones were like during this time:

And most of Europe was covered in open steppe and tundra grasslands, far from a densely forested environment. So it seems that idea doesn’t work either. Furthermore, there’s no telling what the hormones of extinct creatures were like.

There’s one remaining explanation I can think of. The cave lion, Panthera spelaea, is thought to be descended from Panthera leo fossilis, an extinct subspecies of true lion which emerged about 700,000 years ago. If modern lions only evolved manes since then, that would explain a lot.

Rather nicely consistent with my idea is the two extant subspecies of lion - P. l. leo and P. l. melanochaita. If Wikipedia is to be believed:

> The [Asiatic lion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiatic_lion "en.wikipedia.org") is often considered to have a weak mane . . . [West African lions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_lion "en.wikipedia.org") are often seen with weak manes or none

It would seem that lions of the leo subspecies have, in general, less developed manes than those of the melanochaita subspecies. Therefore, they could perhaps represent a sort of transitional form between the maneless males of fossilis’ day and the lusciously maned ones of Southern and East Africa.

TL;DR: I think that the most likely explanation is that when the ancestors of the cave lion diverged from the rest of Panthera leo, all male lions were maneless, and manes only evolved in the last few hundred thousand years.
