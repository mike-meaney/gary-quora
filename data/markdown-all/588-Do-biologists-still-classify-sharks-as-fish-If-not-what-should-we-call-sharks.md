## Do biologists still classify sharks as fish? If not, what should we call sharks?

In modern taxonomic classification, monophyly is extremely important. Basically, it means that any grouping of organisms (clade) must include a common ancestor and all of its descendants - otherwise, the group does not exist in nature.

As we can see in the dendrogram above, there is no group which includes what we’d call fish which doesn’t include tetrapods like amphibians, reptiles and mammals. Therefore, we can draw two conclusions; all vertebrates are fish, including tetrapods, or “fish” don’t really exist.

If we go for the former, then yes, sharks are fish, because they’re obviously vertebrates. However, if we opt for the second conclusion, “fish” is just an arbitrary term for a non-tetrapod vertebrate. We can still use the term in zoology, it’s just not an actual classification.

Either way, sharks are definitely fish. They’re just not bony fish.
