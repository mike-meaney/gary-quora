This is an interesting question, as - while everyone knows that there are organisms which have gone extinct - actual landscapes which no longer exist are rarely discussed. Here are some I can think of.

*   Mammoth steppe: during the last Ice Age, this was Earth’s most extensive biome, spanning all the way from Spain to Canada. It was an arid polar grassland, teeming with large mammals like the savannas of modern Africa. 12,000 years ago, however, the Arctic climate became wetter and the mammoth steppe was reduced to a few small remnants.

*   Rudist reef: While corals have been around for hundreds of millions of years, they weren’t always the ones who formed the reefs. During the Cretaceous, the dominant reef-building organisms were rudists - bizarre, shelled molluscs which could be tube-shaped, box-shaped or even ring-shaped. The rudists went extinct due to the infamous K-Pg impact.

*   Moss forest: During the Silurian period, when multicellular life was making its first forays onto the land, the only terrestrial ecosystems were so-called “moss forests”. These were formed by Cooksonia \- one of the earliest plants with a stem, up to a metre tall - and interrupted only by Prototaxites \- giant, columnar fungi the size of trees.

*   Coal forest: These were some of the first true forests, appearing in the Carboniferous period. They were wetlands, dominated by an extinct group of trees called the lepidodendrons, and housed many bizarre amphibians and arthropods. When they eventually died out, the forests created enormous amounts of peat, which turned into coal over time - hence the name.

Again, great question, and thanks for asking. Hopefully you’ve enjoyed reading the answer.
