## Does the male lions out of the heartlands of the African continent when once reached a certain age ever out of the blue turn on their biological fathers and slaughter them to pieces once he's let his guard down?

Something similar often happens, although perhaps not as poetically as you describe it.

When male lion cubs reach the age of roughly two years, they reach sexual maturity and begin to feel the effects of testosterone. These new, more aggressive males are a threat to their father and so are exiled from the pride.

After this banishment, the males go their separate ways. They may try set up a coalition of their own, commandeer an existing pride through brute strength, or simply live alone as rogues, mating with other prides' females when the lionessesâ€™ actual mate isn't looking.

Eventually, they'll grow up to be big, brawny adults. Meanwhile, their fathers will be aging, and certainly past their best. Very few male lions die of old age - most are killed by younger, stronger rivals. And those rivals are often their sons.
