## Did pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses) evolve from other marine mammals like whales, or did they evolve from mammals on land?

They evolved from land mammals.

There are currently two theories on the evolution of pinnipeds. One, the “biphyletic” theory, suggests that Pinnipeda is not a natural grouping, and that the pinniped families do not share a common ancestor.

Scientists in support of the biphyletic theory suggest that Phocids (seals) are descended from otter-like mammals, while Otariids (sea lions and fur seals) and Odobenids (walruses) evolved from bear-like ancestors.

This view is generally not accepted by scientists - including myself - as DNA tests confirm that pinnipeds are more closely related to each other than other carnivores. Instead, scientists think that pinnipeds evolved from a single common ancestor - this is called the monophyletic theory.

The monophyletic theory proposes that the first pinnipeds were the Semantorids, which clearly show the intermediary stage between terrestrial and semi-aquatic animals:

The Semantorids then evolved into a new family, the Enaliarctids, which included the largest ever carnivoran, Enaliarctos. A few million years after this time, the split between Otarioids (Sea lions and walruses) and Phocoids (seals) occured.

The first Otarioids were members of the sea lion family, while the first Phocoids belonged to the family Desmatophocidae - which includes animals such as Allodesmus

A google search such as “pinniped evolution” should yield a more informative synopsis of this fascinating transition.
