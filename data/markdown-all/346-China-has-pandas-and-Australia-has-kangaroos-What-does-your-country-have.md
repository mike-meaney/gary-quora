I live in Ireland, and I must admit, it isn’t exactly a hotspot of biodiversity - as countries go, at least. Nevertheless, the island has got about 13,000 documented animal species (the majority of which are insects), although of those very few are uniquely Irish.

On land, we’ve got 26 native mammals, and the more interesting species of these include the elegant red fox,

The red deer, our largest native on dry land,

The European badger, which, although fairly common, I’ve never actually seen before,

The slinky pine marten,

And the even slinkier Eurasian otter.

Other land mammals include 10 species of bat, the hedgehog, , and the stoat. Also keep in mind that there are a number of introduced mammals which have done very well in Ireland - among them the red necked wallaby!

The Australians marsupials were introduced to the offshore isle of Lambay decades ago and have become abundant there. Another notable introduced land mammal would be the grey squirrel (right), from North America, which is infamous for outcompeting Ireland’s native red squirrels (left).

Another fun fact - except for two species of mice, the red squirrel is actually Ireland’s only native rodent.

The island’s waters also have a healthy variety of marine mammals, such as a wide variety of cetaceans. There are blue whales, the largest known animals ever to live,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e7423e81543b91f22a62f6412663f214-lq)

Rare North Atlantic right whales, which are critically endangered in our waters,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-49f6ec7a881ec05f111a8fc63ae7245f-lq)

Orcas,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e1a7e6e4652ee8bae8166f8f9a479308-lq)

And some real oddballs, such as Arctic belugas (they occasionally get lost and find themselves off the Irish coast),

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-425516fdcb9286b400630523f8659535-lq)

The rather backwards-looking Cuvier’s beaked whale, which is also the world’s deepest diving animal,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f295fa9017686f963d5993c5339a88ca-lq)

The frightening false killer whale,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-36f6a86904cf23a95de3ef94d3ed66ba-pjlq)

And even the bizarre pygmy sperm whale.

The other class of marine mammal you’ll find here are my favourite animals; seals. You’ll find two seal species here year-round; the grey seal (first one below) and the common seal (second one). Confusingly, the former is the more common one in Ireland.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-da68bba760ae9cf344ec468da8e7cc24-lq)

An endearing fact - common (or harbour) seals often rest in a “banana pose” to regulate their temperature. Before I move on to the birdies, I should also mention that Ireland sometimes gets vagrant pinnipeds usually only found in the Arctic, like ringed seals, harp seals and even walruses.

Now for some feathered friends. There are more than 480 birds native to Ireland, although of these a dozen or so haven’t been seen here in over half a century. That’s far to much to summarize in full here, so here’s a brief tour of some of the island’s most eyecatching birds.

There’s the vibrant hoopoe, which on rare occasions ends up in Ireland by overshooting Great Britain on migration.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-60ac21514f664ed182a05b68865d6ec7-lq)

The horned grebe, an attractive type of waterbird,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e74a258e1652e351aec91e483551ed6d-lq)

The strange jacksnipe,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e0b51283459cdaba34d7c97326172a2c-lq)

The great skua, an imposing seabird which can be highly aggressive,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-35ae3afb7f6b188141d69969f01d7ca9-lq)

And the golden eagle, of course; our largest and most powerful native raptor.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a46fa0d794bcb6d8c2d97f83c8ffd8e4-lq)

Moving swiftly on, we’ve got a handful of reptiles and amphibians. On land, there’s only one native reptile - the viviparous lizard.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5d0adf86a0ee68393a531876a4883dab-lq)

(There are also slowworms in a famous limestone region known as the Burren, but they’re most likely introduced).

Meanwhile in the oceans, there are a variety of sea turtles, including the immense leatherback sea turtle.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d61e51771afbcbe69eefcc630f4348b4-lq)

In terms of amphibians, Ireland has just got three species - the smooth newt, European frog, and - on a small pocket of the West Coast - the endangered natterjack toad.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b2201042ab7343d286a274d53f5c9c08-pjlq)

Now, onto the fish. The Republic’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) spans around 880,000 square kilometres of the North Atlantic, and includes around 400 fish species. Of these, the most eyecatching would be our various sharks, such as the basking shark,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a675d0dd95af3ec0bf9bce97db7e88f2-lq)

The Greenland shark, a northern giant which is the world’s longest-lived vertebrate,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-56b89ec5d054047f236b1b5757166444-lq)

The critically endangered angel shark, which has been wiped out in the North Sea but persists on the Irish west coast,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0a278f4a6f5dd8e8da1323bd72861500-lq)

And many more.

All of the above really just concerns Ireland’s vertebrates, but we have over 10,000 invertebrate species too. That being said, most of those are fairly standard and this answer is getting very long so I’ll omit an overview of them.

* * *

Lastly, a note on endemic species. While giant pandas are native only to China and kangaroos only to Australia, all the wildlife I’ve discussed is found in other countries too. Ireland does have some endemic species - a handful of invertebrates, and some freshwater fish - but none of them are very interesting, I’m afraid.

There are also some subspecies of animals which are only found in Ireland, such as the Irish mountain hare (Lepidus timidus hibernicus).

Alas, that’s all for now. For the next couple of weeks, I’ll be away from home, so it’ll be harder to answer questions regularly. We’ll see what happens. Anyway, thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed the answer, and have a nice day.
