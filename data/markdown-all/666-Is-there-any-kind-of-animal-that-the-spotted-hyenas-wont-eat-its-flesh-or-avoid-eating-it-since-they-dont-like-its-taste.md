## Is there any kind of animal that the spotted hyenas won't eat its flesh or avoid eating it since they don't like its taste?

Hans Kruuk said in his 1972 book The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behaviour:

> Hyenas and jackals do not seem to like each other as food . . . I did see hyenas eat a jackal on another occasion. Then, also, it was obvious that the hyenas did not really like the jackal meat; it took four hyenas over half an hour to eat a golden jackal.

While, obviously, the hyenas in question did eat the jackal, they’ll eat about anything, so it at least answers the question of whether there’s meat they don’t like.
