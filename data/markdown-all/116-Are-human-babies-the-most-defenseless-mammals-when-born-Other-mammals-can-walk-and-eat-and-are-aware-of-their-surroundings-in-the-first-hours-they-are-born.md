## Are human babies the most defenseless mammals when born? Other mammals can walk and eat and are aware of their surroundings in the first hours they are born

Definitely not - take marsupials for example. Kangaroos are born the size of a jelly bean, naked and blind. They’re basically external foetuses.

Even some placental mammals are almost as bad. Newborn mice - also hairless and sightless - look like raw cocktail sausages.

Surprisingly, the babies of giant pandas are pretty defenseless, too. They have only sparse fur, are blind, and - at birth - may be 1,000 times smaller than the adult they’ll grow up to be.

What all these animals have in common is that they’re born sheltered. Joeys live safe in a pouch, mice pups in a burrow, and giant pandas have no natural predators. Humans are similar, but not quite as sheltered at birth - at least in the hunter-gatherer, savanna-dwelling lifestyle we’re adapted for.
