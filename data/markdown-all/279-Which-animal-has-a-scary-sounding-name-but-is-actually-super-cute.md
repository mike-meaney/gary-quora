Well, there are quite a few. The first to come to mind for me is the satanic leaf-tailed gecko, a Madagascan creature which was named on the basis of its bizarre appearance.

Then there’s the killdeer, a wading bird found in North America as well as parts of South America. As you can probably tell from its appearance, it’s not much of a cervid assassin - it just makes a call which sounds like “killdeer!”.

And, while I wouldn’t call it cute, an honourable mention is the animal which has one of the most badass common names of all - the dragonhunter. It is, in fact, only a species of dragonfly which eats insects - including other dragonflies, hence the name.

Of course, there are examples of the opposite in the world of animal names - for instance, the boomslang - a highly venomous snake with a somewhat silly and unassuming name.
