Unsurprisingly, everyone would die. There are at least 10,000 species of bird in the world, possibly as many as 18,000. When a disillusioned world leader tried to exterminate just one of them, it lead to the deadliest famine in the history of mankind.

I’m referring to the Great Chinese Famine of 1959, which was a result of Chairman Mao’s Great Leap “Forward”. The different factors that culminated in the Famine are somewhat complex, but a major part of it was the CCP’s campaign to eradicate the Eurasian tree sparrow.

I wrote about this event in much more detail [here](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-strangest-conflict-between-humans-and-animals-in-history/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"), but essentially, the sparrows were perceived as vermin which ate crops, so the populace was encouraged to kill them on sight. In truth, they were important predators of many insects, and when China’s tree sparrow population nearly vanished altogether the nation was swept by brutal plagues of locusts.

It’s estimated that the Great Chinese Famine may have killed up to 45 million people. Now imagine the death toll if all birds were wiped out.

Around 3 in 5 of the world’s known bird species are insectivores. It’s likely that the possible thousands of types we haven’t discovered yet are mostly insect-eaters too, since those are generally the smallest, most inconspicuous ones.

So, without all those crucial insectivores, I expect that the world would be ravaged by disease-carrying insects like mosquitoes and tsetse flies, and experience locust plagues of beyond Biblical proportions.

Then there are the many species of birds which are important for the reproduction of plants. Various avian families such as the hummingbirds, sunbirds, sugar-birds, honeycreepers and honeyeaters engage in something called ornithophily: they pollinate flowering plants.

Then you have another phenomenon called endozoochory - in other words, animals eating the fruit of plants and then subsequently dispersing those plants’ seeds. This is how most trees spread their offspring, and among the most important vectors for dispersal are of course birds, which are highly mobile.

Without birds, many plants would fail to produce enough offspring and their numbers would dwindle until eventual extinction.

In my opinion, these two things (an insect population boom and plants dying off) would be the biggest effects of removing all birds from the Earth, but there would be an uncountable number of other devastating consequences. To kill off a dozen thousand vertebrate species is simply too drastic an ecological change for humanity to survive.

On the plus side, no one would have their sandwich snatched by a brazen seagull ever again.
