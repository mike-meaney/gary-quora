## Why is that in so many old movies set in an exotic locale, a kookaburra is heard among the bird calls? Kookaburras are native only to Australia. Are they really that dense, or did they think no one would notice?

Movies use inaccurate animal vocalizations all the time. The textbook example of this is bald eagles. Their piercing cry is common in many films, especially Westerns, but it’s not actually their sound at all.

In reality, Hollywood uses the screech of red-tailed hawks, which are much more dramatic than the real thing. Actual bald eagles make anticlimactic high-pitched chirps, comparable to the whistles of a stovetop kettle. To make matters worse, they are chiefly scavenging animals, not predators.

Lions are similarly disappointing to the film industry. Most lion roars in movies are dramatic, formidable snarls which are actually produced by tigers. Having witnessed wild lions roar myself, I can tell you that the sound is often more like a low, almost melancholy groan.

Most of the time, this is due to what some call the “Coconut Effect”; unrealistic sound effects being used because viewers expect to hear them. When horses plod on grass or some other soft surface, their steps are muffled, but movie sound designers usually add a clip clop sound by tapping coconut shells together.

Pumas, cheetahs and wolves don’t roar, yet you’ll often hear these sounds in films. Hyenas don’t make dog noises, insects don’t sound wet and crunchy, fish make practically no noise at all… the list goes on.

Sometimes, you’ll see misleading animal sounds in movies simply because the real thing is harder to acquire. African elephant noises are hard to come by on public domain sound effect databases, so those of Asian elephants are usually used to replace them.

So, to answer your question, unrealistic animal noises - e.g. kookaburras on vacation - are less the exception than the rule in most films. It’s not that they think no one will notice, they just know it communicates the impression they want to give to most viewers.
