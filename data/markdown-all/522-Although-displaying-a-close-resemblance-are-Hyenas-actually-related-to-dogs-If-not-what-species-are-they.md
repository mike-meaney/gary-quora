Above is a phylogenetic tree of all families in the order Carnivora - which includes hyenas and dogs. In case you’re new to cladistics; basically, the smaller a “branch” of the tree two families are on, the closer they’re related.

Carnivora is divided into two main suborders, Feliformia and Caniformia. Hyenas’ exact position on the tree is debated, but most scientists agree that they’re most closely related to mongooses (Herpestidae).

Dogs, on the other hand, are in the suborder Caniformia, which also includes things like weasels, bears and seals. So, no, they’re not closely related.

They’ve evolved similar appearances due to a phenomenon called convergent evolution; when two unrelated species evolve to look similar due to having similar needs and environmental pressures.

The dog-like head of hyenas is because both dogs and hyenas have a telocephalic bite - they direct the brunt of the force towards the back of the mouth (the carnassials) rather than the front (canines), which is called a brachycephalic bite and is used by cats. The carnassials are built for grinding and crushing, while the canines (as in canine teeth) are more for quick dispatching of prey, which neither dogs nor hyenas specialize in.

They also both have proportionately longer forelegs than hindlegs because they’re cursorial; cats, on the contrary, prefer to pounce, hence their long hindlegs. They also have non-retractile claws, which are blunt and built for getting traction on a long run.

In conclusion; they’re not related, but they look similar because they both are non-arboreal, cursorial pack predators which have a telocephalic bite.
