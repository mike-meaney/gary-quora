Probably Tyrannosaurus rex, in my case, but it depends on your taste in meat.

I prefer red meat to white meat, but it’s the other way around for a large proportion of people, so you take your pick. In any case, I believe sauropod muscle would be more on the white side.

Ever wondered why red meat is red? It’s because of the protein myoglobin, which stores oxygen for energy use. Hence, animals which are more active, and run around a lot, tend to have redder meat - this is why near-flightless chickens have paler meat than ducks, which are better aviators.

Tyrannosaurs were likely much more active animals than sauropods, especially ones as big as Brontosaurus. As such, it’s reasonable to hypothesize that their muscles had much more myoglobin and were thus “redder”.

If you prefer white meat, then sauropod steak would probably be more your thing.
