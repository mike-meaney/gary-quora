Well, for one thing, this:

Is a lot bigger than this:

Likewise, an Asian elephant:

Is far bigger than an impala:

And this:

Sounds much more impressive than this:

The fact that they live alongside, or “in the shadow” of, the larger lions is probably also a factor. Another reason is that they’re - to most people - very easily confused with jaguars and cheetahs, making them harder to remember as a species.
