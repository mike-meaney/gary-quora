## What if there were only carnivorous animals but no herbivorous creatures?

Wow, this is the second question I’ve answered today about speculation on removing tiers from the food chain.

So, imagine we have a tropical savanna ecosystem in East Africa. The food chain goes something like this:

Lion - Wildebeest - Plants

Now, this is very rough, since there are dozens of other herbivores on the East African savannas that would fill the niche instantly, but let’s just assume that in this ecosystem the wildebeest is the only large grazer and the lion and leopard are the only two large predators.

So, when the herbivores are removed, the food chain becomes this:

Lion - X - Plants,

with X representing the vacant niche of the herbivores. Now that the wildebeest are largely wiped out, the lions would have no food and would soon leave, thus meaning:

X - X - Plants,

causing plant populations to grow uncontrollably. This situation won’t last long, and there are 3 scenarios that could occur, of which one will almost always ensu

1.Another grass-eating animal invades, for example, zebra. It brings with it its own predators (E.g. hyenas.). Now the food chain looks like this:

Hyena - Zebra - Plants

2\. Another population of wildebeest invades, bringing back the lions, creating:

Lion - Different Wildebeest - Plants

3\. The last scenario is that a resistant population of wildebeest that survived the disease or whatever killed the rest, making the food chain:

Lion - Resistant Wildebeest - Plants

So, that’s my answer for you. Hope you’re happy with it!
