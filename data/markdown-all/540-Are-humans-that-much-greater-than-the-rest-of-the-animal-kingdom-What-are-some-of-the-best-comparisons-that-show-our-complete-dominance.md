## Are humans that much greater than the rest of the animal kingdom? What are some of the best comparisons that show our complete dominance?

“Greatness” and “dominance” are too very subjective words, at least in this context. Homo sapiens is not, as you might think, the most numerous species. There are possibly tens of quintillions of nematodes on this Earth.

We don’t build more impressive structures than animals, either. Take the 4,000 year old Brazilian termite colony discovered less than a year ago, which was approximately the size of Great Britain.

Ther are even animals with bigger societies than humans. Argentine ants control global super-colonies, single populations which span several continents and can contain nearly a trillion individuals.

What we do have is language, and that’s the main thing that sets us apart from other species. But even then, does that make us great? I don’t think this looks like greatness:

Yes, humans can do great things. So can other animals. In my view, a species cannot be called great or not great; but if they could, humans definitely wouldn’t rank first.
