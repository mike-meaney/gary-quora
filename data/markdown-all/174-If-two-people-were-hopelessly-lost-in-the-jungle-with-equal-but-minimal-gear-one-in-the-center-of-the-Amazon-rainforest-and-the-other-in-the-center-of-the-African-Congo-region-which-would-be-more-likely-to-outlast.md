## If two people were hopelessly lost in the jungle with equal but minimal gear, one in the center of the Amazon rainforest and the other in the center of the African Congo region, which would be more likely to outlast the other?

Interesting scenario. First of all, let’s find out where these unlucky survivalists have ended up.

I’ll define the regions you’ve given as the drainage basins of the Amazon and Congo Rivers, since that’s really the only way to determine this objectively. Eyeballing it, the geographical center of the Amazon Basin is something like -6 degrees south and -63 degrees west:

While the center of the Congo Basin would be roughly here, at ~3 degrees south and 22 degrees east.

Zooming in, we can see that both places are pretty impenetrable rainforest:

The closest settlement to the point I guessed as the centre of the Amazon is the town of Canutama, on the banks of the Purus River, which is home to about 10,000 people. As the crow flies, it’s 84 kilometres away.

Of course, I could have been dozens of kilometres off, but for simplicity’s sake let’s say the person was dropped at the point I chose.

Applying the same disclaimer to the Congo, the closest settlement to my estimated centre would be Kole, which also has a population of about 10,000. Prospects are less bleak this time, as the town is only 26 kilometres away.

On the other hand, the living conditions in Kole would be much poorer, as the Democratic Republic of the Congo is less developed than Brazil. That being said, it sure beats the rainforest.

Both of these towns would have hospitable people, plenty of food, and places to sleep, and they both have small airports too. Flights, of course, would not be regularly scheduled, but getting back home is the easy part. Once the subjects of our thought experiment reached civilization, they would essentially be guaranteed escape.

As such, the real problem is getting to a settlement. Given the heat, humidity and tangled environment, someone in good shape could probably cover around 12 kilometres every day, assuming they hike for 8 hours.

Obviously, these hopeful survivors won’t have the knowledge to make a beeline for the nearest town. If they’re logical, they’ll likely head downhill until they come to a river, and then follow its course until they find civilization.

Let’s apply that to the areas we’ve chosen. It actually makes matters worse for our Amazon explorer; the drop point is much closer to a different river, the Rio Itaparaná. It’ll be about 11 kilometres (a day’s walk) to the bank.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2c6e12e55ae6967032f802536648f3be-lq)

Now they will be faced with a choice - head north or south. If they decide on the former, they’ll have to follow the river for about 110 kilometres (10 days) before they reach a small village.

If they head south, they’ll have a gruelling ~140 kilometre trek, after which they’ll reach the Trans-Amazonian Highway. This is a massive road which cuts right through the Amazon Rainforest, stretching for 4,000 kilometres. The section they will arrive at is unpaved.

Let’s check in on our guy in Africa. Using the same strategy, they would only have a two kilometre walk to the nearest river, which has no name on Google Maps. Heading southeast, it’s only ~33 kilometres to Kole, or a few days of trekking.

Heading northwest, it’s actually only 14 kilometres to the nearest village, which is also unnamed. You could get there in just over a day, I’d say. As you can see, it’s not exactly a modern metropolis:

But it would have shelter, food and people, and therefore the rest is easy. Let’s compare the journeys these two people have to make.

In the Amazon, they’ll need to walk for a week or more to have any chance of rescue. They will probably either end up at a small cluster of houses or an unpaved road cutting through the rainforest. Either way, I’d say they’d have a good chance of getting rescued by loggers passing through.

In the Congo, the prospects are much brighter. They could either head for Kole, a large town with an airport, and take around four days, or set off northwest and find a small village in half that time. They could probably make it without even eating, to be honest.

In this scenario, the person who materialized in the Congo Basin has a much better chance of survival and will likely be the first to get home. That being said, I think the other in the Amazon could still make it out alive eventually, with some luck.

Now, although the situation I looked at here was quite specific, and I did make assumptions, I imagine that this result would hold up in general too.

Jungle is jungle; be it Amazonian or African, it’s more or less the same. What really matters is how close you are to human settlement, and overall the Congo is much more densely populated than the Amazon.
