If the number of hyenas was equal to the number of wolves, and those hyenas were spotted hyenas (which are the only ones which are found in groups), then the hyenas would win.

The hyenas are larger, more powerfully built, stronger, more intelligent, and have a more powerful bite force. The two species have about the same top speed, so thatâ€™s not going to aid the wolves either.

Overall, spotted hyenas would have much better odds in a fight against grey wolves, or at least one where the numbers on both sides were equal.
