## Why are humans so varied in our physical form (skin, facial bone structures, heights) other than any other species?

Up to 2 per cent of the population is thought to be affected by a neurological disorder known as prosopagnosia, or face blindness. These people cannot differentiate between the facial features of others, including close relatives, friends, and even themselves, despite having perfect vision. They generally have to rely on other cues like hair/skin colour, clothing, body language/shape etc. to recognize people.

When it comes to animals, most uninitiated humans have a kind of prosopagnosia - not because of a brain disorder or injury, but because of lack of practice. Most peoples' brains are really good at recognizing very subtle details in the shape and form of faces, in part because they've spent their entire lives surrounded by fellow humans.

There's no evolutionary reason for the brain to be intrinsically good at telling animal faces apart, and the average person doesn't spend much time around a specific group of animals of the same species. Anyone who has been in close association with, say, a herd of elephants or a family of gorillas for an extended period of time will have no trouble recognizing each of them, I guarantee it.

There are so many ways that individual animals vary, you just need to take some time to notice them. Body size, colour, patterns, markings, scars, proportions, fur length, facial structure, genetic quirks, birth defects, dentitionâ€¦ to name a few. And, of course, most people would benefit from spending more time with animals anyway.

Thanks very much for reading, guys, and have a nice day.
