## Has anyone used aquatic animals in warfare, similar to elephants and horses, eg. Has anyone used dolphins, whales or sharks?

Yes, the United States Navy has a whole program - the Navy Marine Mammal Program - which deals with this kind of thing. Based in San Diego, with a second laboratory in Hawaii, its animals have taken part in the Vietnam War and, more recently, the Iraq War.

Most of the animals employed by the program are bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions, although the project started out using Pacific white-sided dolphins.

The marine mammals are used for a wide variety of purposes. In the Iraq War, the dolphins reportedly detected over 100 mines and other underwater traps in a single port, Umm Qasar. Their echolocation ability makes them very good at detecting mines in murky waters.

In the Vietnam War, both dolphins and sea lions served as sentries, guarding harbors and other military installations. When they detected an intruder, theyâ€™d attach to them a device which would cause a buoy on the surface to explode, giving away their presence.

With their superb diving ability, sea lions can be used to recover objects on the seabed far better than human divers. The team has even been trained (using dummies) to recover bodies from an airplane crash.

There are rumors that the Navy uses its marine mammals in attack missions, but these are dismissed as myths, and are frankly quite implausible. The Soviet Union also had a similar program, but this was abandoned.
