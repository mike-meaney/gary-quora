That’s something of a misconception, actually. African animals have been hunted by humans for hundreds of thousands of years, so we are more formidable to these creatures than you might think. Even apex predators like spotted hyenas will scatter if you stand up in your jeep.

So, what the vehicles really do is allow you to get up close and personal with the wildlife, without scaring or disturbing them.

Another important thing to note is that walking safaris are always accompanied by local rangers armed with rifles. These walk at the front of the group, so as not to accidentally shoot the tourist in the back in the event of an animal attack.

Thirdly, I’d like to mention that you’re in much more danger from small, venomous creatures than you are from the likes of lions and leopards. The closest I ever came to being in danger from wildlife while on safari was when an extremely venomous boomslang snake entered the lodge. However, it was immediately dispatched by the guards.

Here he is:

All that being said, there are still dangers associated with walking safaris, especially if the tourists don’t act sensibly. While extremely rare, people have been seriously injured or killed on these tours, such as Thomas McAfee seven years ago: [Doctor's death raises questions about walking safari tours](https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/education/sdut-recent-elephant-trampling-incident-raises-2013sep07-story.html "www.sandiegouniontribune.com").

In short; the risk of being seriously harmed on a walking safari is statistically very low, but it still exists. As a rule of thumb, if the safari is offered within the bounds of a national park, it’s probably safe. McAfee died on a tour in unregulated wilderness, because the local national park deemed walking safaris in the area unsafe.
