The earliest rudiments of eyes are very simple things to get in order. Even single-celled organisms have them. You see the red spot on this Excavate (looks to be a Euglena sp.)?

That’s an eyespot, or stigmatum. With its little patch of photoreceptors, algae cannot only sense the presence or absence of light, but even its direction and intensity. For a long time, eyespots were the best life had for photoreception - here’s a much more complex flatworm (Dugesia sp., a type of planarian), clearly having two eyespots.

Eventually, though, the eye was improved. The next step in the evolution of our eyes was the “pigment cup”. Instead of just having lights-sensitive patches, the photoreceptor cells were in an indented cup so that the direction of light could be accurately determined.

Here’s the head of a polychaete worm (Dumeril’s clam worm, to be precise), with four eyes of the pigment cup variety.

However, the light this worm sees is too blurry to form an image; it’s not focused enough. So, to focus the light, the next rung on the ladder was to make a smaller opening. These new eyes were like pinhole cameras - filled with fluid and with a tiny hole to let in focused beams of light. This is a nautilus, which has this very type of eye.

This design is still imperfect, though. The small nature of the hole means that only a small amount of light can get in. If you want a broad radius for collecting light but also a means to focus it, the solution is a lens.

A lens is, at its simplest, a transparent glob, and over millions of years of evolutionary refinement, the convex dish seen in the eyes of vertebrates, cephalopods and even… box jellyfish.

Thus, through a series of small steps, a simple patch of pigment cells became the seemingly complex apparatus we have in our eye sockets.
