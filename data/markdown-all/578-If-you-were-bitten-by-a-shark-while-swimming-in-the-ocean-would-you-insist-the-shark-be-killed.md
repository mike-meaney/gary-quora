God no.

There are a few reasons why a shark would attack a human:

*   The human is thick as two planks and has harassed the shark
*   The shark mistook the human for a seal or other prey item
*   The shark was curious and its exploratory nibbling was too hard

If I had been harassing it, then it was entirely my fault and no blame should be put on the shark for attacking me. If it mistook me for a seal, once it realized I was a human it would retreat. If it was because of an exploratory bite, then the shark wasn’t hunting me or intentionally harming me.

In none of these scenarios should the shark deserve to be killed. The only practical reason to kill an animal which has attacked a human is to stop it from doing it again, but sharks don’t like the taste of human anyway so it doesn’t matter.

The only other reason why someone would want it killed would be in vengeance. Anyone who is more comfortable in knowing that a random animal, which did not intend to harm it, has been killed is a sad, sad person indeed.
