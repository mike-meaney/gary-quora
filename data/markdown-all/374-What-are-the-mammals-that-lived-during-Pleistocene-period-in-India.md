India has one of the richest wildlife assemblages of any country, and during the Pleistocene it was no different - except that back then, just like in most regions of the world, things were bigger, badder and cooler.

(Note that, alongside these extinct mammals, there would have been many of the species which persist in India, e.g. tigers, water buffalo, gaur etc.)

Among the herbivores of the subcontinent was Sivatherium giganteum, an extinct member of the giraffe family. In fact, it was the largest ever giraffe, and perhaps the largest ever ruminant too. In build it resembled a modern okapi, but it could have weighed up to 1,250 kilograms! It also had four ossicones, two of which were large and antler-like.

In the bamboo forest-grassland mosaics of northern India (as well as other parts of Asia), there was a huge species of great ape, Gigantopithecus bilaspurensis. Related to orangutans, it was not quite the largest ever primate (its close cousin G. blacki \- found further east - holds that title, at up to 600 kg), it was definitely much larger than any modern gorilla.

The most spectacular plant-eater of Pleistocene India was definitely Palaeoloxodon namadicus, a truly enormous species of elephant. India’s modern resident elephant species - the Asian elephant - weighs up to 7 tons, but Palaeoloxodon is estimated at 22 tons! In fact, that would make it the largest land mammal ever to exist, beating even the famous Paraceratherium.

Another scary Indian pachyderm was Hexaprotodon sivalensis. This hippopotamus wasn’t quite as large as the modern common hippo of Africa, but it had some terrifying dentition, as you can see in the illustration above. Its closest living relative is the pygmy hippo, a mysterious creature which lives in the Congo Basin and is much smaller than H. sivalensis.

Let us not forget the predators, though. One of the most formidable carnivores of the subcontinent was Pachycrocuta, a genus of giant bone-crushing hyena which surpassed all modern hyenas in size. In fact, it was more comparable in size to a lion. Pachycrocuta was likely an active predator and is known to have interacted with early humans.

Much more slight and gracile was Sivapanthera, a close relative of cheetahs but nevertheless in its own distinct genus. Its slender build and long legs indicate that it would have hunted much like its cousins, running down small antelope through superior speed and agility. Together with cheetahs, American cheetahs, pumas and jaguarundis, it forms the “puma lineage” of the feline subfamily.

In the Pleistocene, India also had its own saber-toothed cat, Megantereon. This widespread genus contains several species and was found in Africa, Europe, Asia and North America. I imagine it was similar to a jaguar in ecology - indeed it was similarly sized, weighing an estimated 90–150 kilograms.

I know these are fairly well-known compared to most of my other answers like this, but there doesn’t seem to many obscure yet exciting mammals which fit the bill. If you want an underrated Pleistocene Indian animal, google Varanus sivalensis, but it’s not a mammal so I couldn’t include it here.
