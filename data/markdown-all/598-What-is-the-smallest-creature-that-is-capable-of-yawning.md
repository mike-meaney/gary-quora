As Sharon has said, the smallest yawning animal I know of is the Siamese fighting fish. I also researched this and could not find a smaller yawner.

These beautiful, highly selectively-bred creatures are famed for their aggression, and - as a threatening display - when they see a conspecific they draw back their lips and open their mouths wide, which is yawning in the zoological sense.

If you mean normal, tiredness yawning, then I’m not aware of any small animals which do this. Dogs yawn when they’re uncertain, snakes when they’re realigning their unhinged jaws, and guinea pigs, penguins, baboons and indeed fighting fishes when they’re displaying aggressively.

You often see big cats like lions and tigers yawn after a hunt or when they lie down, so I’m assuming that that has a similar function to humans; tiredness, sleepiness and the like.
