## Could a Spinosaurus' arms actually be used to defend itself from other dinosaurs?

It was, as you probably know, a fish eater or piscivore. Presumably, these huge arms were for aiding it in catching fish. Planet Dinosaur, though its Spinosaurus reconstruction is now a little dated, had a nice fishing scene.

As Matt Conrad has said, we actually don’t have fossil remains of Spinosaurus forelimbs. However, we use the fairly reliable process of phylogenetic bracketing to deduce that it likely did have long arms, since its relatives Baryonyx and Suchomimus are known to possess them.

That’s Suchomimus above. Its cousin, Baryonyx, is even better preserved, with a more or less complete skeleton I believe.
