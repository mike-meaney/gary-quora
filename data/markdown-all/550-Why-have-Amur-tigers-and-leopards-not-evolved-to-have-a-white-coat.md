I assume youâ€™re basing this question off the mutation which caused polar bears to become white quite recently. Well, this is a polar bear habitat:

And this is the Amur forest:

Amur tigers and Amur leopards are both forest-dwelling species, and trees are greyish-brown, not white. Any white animal would stick out like a sore thumb amidst all the dark bark.
