## Why is there such a huge difference in dental formula between the bat-eared fox and the aardwolf when they both rely on the same food source?

I believe it’s because of their phylogeny. (I can already tell this probably won’t get much upvotes.)

The hyaenids have the second-least number of teeth of the carnivorans, after the cats. Their dentition is similar to that of the canids, but is more adapted for consuming coarse food. At first I thought that this could be the reason for the difference - that the aardwolf’s teeth are intermediate between bone-crushing and termite-eating - but I quickly discarded this theory because the first hyaenids were insectivorous.

However, the dental formula of animals largely depends on the genetic cocktail of its ancestors, so this might be an answer.

Life often evolves multiple solutions to the same problem. Examples would be the anatomy of the bird and bat wing, where one lost its digits while the other used them to support the wing.

So, to give you a short answer, the teeth of hyenas and canids are different, and there are multiple ways of dealing with the same problem.

I know that this is a little hazy, but that’s science for you. Thanks for asking, and sorry for the (kind of) boring answer.
