In North America, I’ve seen bison, elk, mule deer, pronghorn antelope, coyotes, and wolves. Some of those are less exotic than others, but they wouldn’t be everyday occurrences for most people. There was even this wild bison, which I could have touched if I wanted to (die). That’s not a fence in a zoo, that’s the fence of a carpark in the middle of the forest.

In terms of birds, America hasn’t yielded me as much, though my numerous peregrine falcon, [osprey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osprey "en.wikipedia.org") and bald eagle sightings were memorable.

On my last trip to Africa, I made a list of how many vertebrate species I sighted, excluding unidentified ones, and it was well over 50. However, to give you some examples, I’ve observed lions, leopards, cheetahs, spotted hyenas, jackals, impala, [Thomson’s gazelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson%27s_gazelle "en.wikipedia.org"), eland, black rhinos, white rhinos, hippos, giraffes, zebras, wildebeest, buffalo, elephants, [topi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topi "en.wikipedia.org"), warthogs, [dik-diks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirk%27s_dik-dik "en.wikipedia.org"), [klipspringers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klipspringer "en.wikipedia.org"), baboons, [vervet monkeys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vervet_monkey "en.wikipedia.org"), [waterbuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterbuck "en.wikipedia.org"), [bushbuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_bushbuck "en.wikipedia.org"), [kudu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_kudu "en.wikipedia.org"), mongooses, and crocodiles, all in the East African wilderness.

Then, moving onto birds, I’ve seen a number of vulture species, [marabou storks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marabou_stork "en.wikipedia.org"), [snake eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_snake_eagle "en.wikipedia.org"), [long-crested eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-crested_eagle "en.wikipedia.org"), [martial eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial_eagle "en.wikipedia.org") (one of my favourite birds), [African fish eagles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_fish_eagle "en.wikipedia.org"), [lilac-breasted rollers,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilac-breasted_roller "en.wikipedia.org") [hamerkop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamerkop "en.wikipedia.org"), [kori bustards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kori_bustard "en.wikipedia.org"), [secretary birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretarybird "en.wikipedia.org"), [Egyptian geese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_goose "en.wikipedia.org"), cormorants, plovers, egrets and [lapwings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksmith_lapwing "en.wikipedia.org").

Those two places - America and Africa - are the main wildlife hotspots I’ve been to, but other trips have yielded more exotic animals, only in lesser numbers. In Croatia, I’ve seen a good few species of snake, while in Hawaii, I found Hawaiian monk seals (what I had come there for), green sea turtles, [needlefish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_needlefish "en.wikipedia.org"), butterfly fish, [unicornfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitemargin_unicornfish "en.wikipedia.org"), [tangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acanthurus_triostegus "en.wikipedia.org"), sea snakes, and of course the [humuhumunukunukuapua'a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reef_triggerfish "en.wikipedia.org"), among other things.

On boat trips before I’ve sometimes seen gray whales or humpback whales pass by, though that’s only happened one or two times, and the whale was usually too far away for me to get a good quality picture.

My country of Ireland is a pretty lousy place to go looking for wildlife, but I’ve managed to find such oddities as [silverfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverfish "en.wikipedia.org"), shield bugs, and [ragworms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alitta_virens "en.wikipedia.org") in the countryside. Despite not being very exotic, seals are one of my favourite animals and I’ve gone out to see them several times, sometimes with luck. I even got to pet one that was being released from a sanctuary (does that count as in the wild?).

I am grateful that my profession allows me to go places where I can spend time with the things that I love, which are of course animals. My next trip is coming up in 2019, when I’ll be going to Kenya and hopefully see some more exotic creatures.

(I’ve added links for the more obscure animals)
