Reasons differ for the animals you describe, so I’ll deal with them separately. When you say “frogs”, I’m assuming you’re referring to the glass frogs, family Centrolenidae.

Leaves, as you may know, are translucent to a certain degree, so when light shines through them, the silhouette of anything truly opaque is highlighted starkly. Transparency lets light through, so that it’s harder for predators to see the frog through the leaf. Transparency is, actually, the proper term for that form of camouflage, and is classified as a type of general protective resemblance.

As for the lizards, the closest I can think of would be various geckos, as far as I can remember, but they’re barely even translucent, so I doubt it’s a direct consequence of any kind of camouflage. It may well be simply due to lack of pigment, which - in the case of the geckos - vaguely resembles desert sands, while also removing the need for more producing energy-sapping pigments.

Now, the fish. I presume the ones you’re talking about here are deep sea fish, like this charming leafvent anglerfish:

Well, the answer is simple; the deep sea is dark. In complete darkness, nothing’s going to see you any way, so you don’t need camouflage or visual display features. Therefore, especially in as harsh an environment as the deep, the fish that spend less energy on manufacturing pigments, and more on necessary survival, are more likely to survive and pass on their genes.
