Most freshwater fish wouldn’t mind a bit of scavenged meat, but there are fish like piranhas, pikes and gars that are specially adapted for it.

Then, with reptiles, you’ve got the crocodilians (Crocodiles, alligators, caimans and gharials.), a lot of snakes like water moccasins, anaconda and keelback snakes.

I’m not sure if birds count, but herons, ducks, swans and storks hunt in freshwater and are carnivores.

Among the mammals, there are river dolphins, otters and a few species of seal (Caspian, Harbour and Baikal).

There are too many carnivorous amphibians to name, but you might be interested in some more eye-catching ones like the Chinese giant salamander.

There are quite a lot of freshwater carnivorous invertebrates, so I won’t be able to name them all.

Hope I answered your question well!
