I think it might just be the wrinkle-faced bat. When the annual mating season comes around, this Central American bat pulls a soft white “mask” of skin over the lower half of its face. Sound familiar?

They don’t, however, do this to prevent the spread of disease (bats aren’t very good at this, as we’ve all found out this year…). Rather, the males “sing” in ultrasonic whistles through their masks, trying to attract females.

This, therefore, implies that if a male refused to wear his face mask, he wouldn’t get to reproduce. I pray to God this applies to humans too.

Jokes aside, the discovery of this behaviour (which was, as a matter of fact, made in 2020) is important, because it’s a very rare example of lekking behaviour in mammals. Many birds practice lekking - males gathering together and performing to attract females - but was unheard of in bats until now.

Both bats and face masks have played an integral role in making 2020 the unprecedented time it has been. Furthermore, I can’t think of a more hideous, convoluted face to sum up this absolute train wreck of a year…

This is all of us after coming out of lockdown. Thanks for reading, have a nice day, and wear a mask.
