I’m afraid the only real answer I can give you is… we don’t know.

I’ve discussed this with others in-depth, and have ruled out climate change as something that’ll wipe out humans in the next 100 years. In fact, I highly doubt that anything will wipe out humans in the next 100 years.

For one thing, we have the largest distribution range of any animal ever to live. Humans occupy nearly every inch of land on the Earth with the exception of most of Antarctica and Greenland, and the northernmost parts of Canada.

Secondly, we have numbers on our side. It’s really hard to wipe out a species with such a massive range, but it’s exponentially harder when there’s seven and a half billion of them and counting, with an increase of 200,000 people every day.

Lastly, if civilization really does collapse, then the problem stops. If climate change causes technology to degrade, then all the global warming stops. If the population declines due to climate change, then overpopulation stops. Basically, the nature of climate change means that it’s a process that will stop before the extinction of humans is possible.

Other cliche scenarios:

*   War with alien life - I doubt that intelligence is common in the universe, so this is not something I foresee happening likelily
*   Disease - no pathogen can spread so fast that it cannot be eradicated by the combined efforts of all humanity
*   The Sun doing screwing us up - humans will be extinct before this happens

So, as I simply cannot predict exactly how humans will go extinct, I’m afraid I can’t answer your question satisfactorily. However, I expect that civilization will fall due to a number of combined cataclysms, and the remaining pockets will be picked off by more minor, local disasters.
