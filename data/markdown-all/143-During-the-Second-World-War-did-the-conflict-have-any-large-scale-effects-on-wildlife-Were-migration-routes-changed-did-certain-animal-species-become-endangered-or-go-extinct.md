## During the Second World War, did the conflict have any large scale effects on wildlife? Were migration routes changed, did certain animal species become endangered or go extinct?

This question was actually pretty hard to research, but it’s definitely a cool one, so I did some digging and came up with a few relevant tidbits of information. In some cases here, the photos are just for illustrative purposes, they’re not directly related to or from the event I describe.

*   As you would expect, the Iron Curtain (a result of World War II) had effects on the migration of European wildlife. In fact, tracking devices show that red deer still avoid the border between what was once Czechoslovakia and West Germany!

*   In Hungary’s sodic meadows, bomb craters from World War II have filled up with saline water. These actually now serve as refuges for otherwise rare organisms, including turtles, aquatic beetles and an endemic species of fairy shrimp.

*   Starting in 1950, Western Europe experienced an influx of foxes, which in turn caused a surge in rabies in the region. In the book Absolute War, Chris Bellamy says that these foxes (along with other animals) were forced out of Eastern Europe by advancing Soviet troops.

*   In the Second World War, most fishing boats were repurposed for military use, and many fishermen joined the army. Because of this, commercial fishing ground to a halt on much of the European coast, allowing fish populations to recover. Had WWII not occurred, overfishing might be a significantly worse problem today.

*   In Hungary, several endemic dog breeds were driven to the verge of extinction by the fighting. I know they don’t really count as wildlife, but I felt it was still relevant here. One such example are the retriever-like kuvaszok (singular kuvasz), which were so protective of their families that soldiers sought them out and killed them. Thankfully, the breed has since recovered.

*   In the so-called “death strip” (the no man’s land in between each side of the Iron Curtain, which as said was a result of the War), the total absence of human activity has created a haven for wildlife, and the strip is now a protected area. Similar situations have arisen in the DMZ between North and South Korea, and in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone.

There are also numerous effects on wildlife which World War II would have had, had Allied or German governments carried through with certain plans. These plans include:

*   An RAF scheme to firebomb German forests, which they hoped would cause animals to flee to agricultural areas. The game would have to eat crops, causing a food crisis in the country. Or, that was the idea, anyway.

*   The Nazi zoologist (and friend of Hermann Göring) Lutz Heck had planned to “resurrect” the extinct bovine, known as the aurochs, by selectively breeding cattle. He wanted to restore “primeval German game”, in a patriotic kind of way. The program failed, only creating a breed of cattle, pictured, which didn’t much resemble the aurochs.

*   The bizarre German idea known as Atlantropa. It involved building a hydroelectric dam over the Strait of Gibraltar, simultaneously generating huge amounts of power and lowering sea level by about 200 metres, creating plenty of “living space” for Nazi Germany. Of course, had this taken place, it would have huge ecological consequences.

So that’s what my research has turned up. Hopefully this answers your question, and thanks for reading.

EDIT: Here’s another point which I should definitely mention here:

*   In 1941, thousands of Japanese troops were stranded on Wake Island in the Pacific due to an American blockade. Threatened with starvation, they were forced to hunt the island’s endemic species of flightless rail to extinction.
