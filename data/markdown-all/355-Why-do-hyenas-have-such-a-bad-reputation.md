Thanks for the A2A.

In his essay “Why Look At Animals?”, John Berger makes this intelligent observation, that animal reputations often stem not from their qualities but from the fact that they are used as metaphors, to express human traits. He writes that;

> These animals have become prisoners of a human/social situation into which they have been press-ganged. The vulture as landlord is more dreadfully rapacious than he is as a bird. The crocodiles at dinner are greedier than they are in the river.

Mikita Brottman has written an excellent book, Hyena, which I strongly recommend, where she examines the cultural perception of hyenas in cultures all over the world and all through the ages. In the book, she outlines “five possible reasons for the degradation of hyenas”.

Evolutionary role: This is actually something which I suspected quite a bit before I ever read Brottman’s book, and I was pleasantly surprised to see someone had been thinking along similar lines.

Hyaenids have co-existed with hominins for as long as hominins had existed, both clades living on the East African plains. Both types of animal hunt large game and scavenge when appropriate, both are cursorial, social predators, and so both animals may well have been locked into fierce competition.

Perhaps our revilement of hyenas is a legacy of our distant past, this idea proposes. If you support evolutionary psychology, it cannot be overlooked.

“Scavenger” status: This one I disagree with. We percieve them as scavengers because they have a bad rap, not the other way around. Spotted hyenas - the species with the poor reputation - obtain, on average, 70% of their food from “honest” hunting. In areas where lions are few, like Ngorongoro, that figure climbs to over 95%.

Not only do lions scavenge from hyenas more than hyenas scavenge from lions, but expert George R. Schaller believes that lions - overall, on average - scavenge more than hyenas, or at least as much.

Hyenas, especially in groups, have a greater hunting success rate than lions. They’ve been seen to bring down huge prey items as large as subadult African elephants. They’re not scavengers.

Ugly appearance: Surely a matter of opinion, this one. Yes, you do get the occasional matted, dirty, blood-caked individual, but for the most part I find hyenas very beautiful. Is this not a handsome beast?

Rather like the previous one, I think that this may be an instance of people looking through biased eyes. Most hyenas look very nice, at least in my opinion, but when people see one having a bad hair day then they tend to remember that due to confirmation bias.

Temperament: She, and I, shot this suggestion down, since it couldn’t be further from the truth. Hyenas are often viewed as either being savage and vicious or cowardly, most often the latter.

Hyenas can be incredibly brave during hunts. It takes guts to attempt to slay a buffalo, giraffe, rhino, hippo, or elephant, as does driving a pride of lions of a kill. Their “feints” seem to belie cowardliness, but are nothing unless testaments to intelligence.

There are many, many records of hyenas acting astonishingly tame and friendly, as gentle as dogs in fact - which is pretty good considering they’re fricking wild animals. Among these records;

> The animal soon became attached to me, in the manner of a faithful and gentle dog . . . this creature became the inseparable companion of my rambles . . . and with her I felt certain of never going astray.

(Anonymous)

> He is preferred to the dog himself for his attachment to his master, his general sagacity, and even, it is said, for his qualifications in the chase.

(John Bruce)

> They were As faithful and diligent as any of the common dogs.

(Sir John Barrow)

I could include more charming quotations, but I think you get the idea.

Association with death: Finally, we have the “filthy habits” of the hyena. I think this one says more about ourselves than about hyenas. We have an understandable - but perhaps unjust - phobia of death and dead bodies; therefore, the notion of scavenging repulses us.

In reality, hyenas are no more associated with scavenging - and thus, death - than lions, but this idea, stemming from the previous misconception about them being scavengers, just boosts their foul reputation further.

Anyway, those are Mikita Brottman’s 5 reasons. From our analysis here, it seems as though the evolutionary psychology standpoint seems to be the most likely option.
