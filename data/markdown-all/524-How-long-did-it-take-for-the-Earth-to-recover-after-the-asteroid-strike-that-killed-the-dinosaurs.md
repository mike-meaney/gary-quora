Not that long, on an evolutionary timescale.

This is a type of mammal called a Pantodont. They were pretty big, at about grizzly bear-size in many cases, and some of the first large animals to appear after the K-Pg extinction.

And they, along with other kinds of mammalian megafauna, first appear in the fossil record about 63 million years ago, just 2.6 million years after the Chixculub impact. For evolution, thatâ€™s the blink of an eye.
