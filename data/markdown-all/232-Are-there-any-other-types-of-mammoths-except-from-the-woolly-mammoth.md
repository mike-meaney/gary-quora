Certainly! In the past five million years, there have been ten different species of mammoth, distributed across Africa, Europe, Asia and North America.

We have a surprisingly thorough understanding of how most of these species fit together, in evolutionary terms. They are as follows.

*   The South African mammoth, the oldest known mammoth species, emerging around 5 million years ago. It inhabited what’s now South Africa and Ethiopia, and was significantly larger than the African savannah elephant of today, at about 9 tonnes.

*   The Romanian mammoth, the least understood of the mammoths. This was the first species to leave Africa - it’s thought that it originated there 3.5 million years ago but migrated to Europe via Syria. Its (very few) fossils have been found in Romania and the United Kingdom. It probably descended from the South African mammoth.

*   The African mammoth, which appeared a little later, around 3 million years ago - shortly before the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch, in which mammoths really flourished. Like its aforementioned relative, it lived on the African continent, North Africa to be specific.

*   The southern mammoth, which emerged in Europe and later spread to Central Asia - probably the first species to venture so far east. It weighed a gigantic 10 tonnes, making it one of the largest land mammals ever. It’s thought to either have evolved from the African or Romanian mammoth.

(They’re just in the background in the image above, but I never pass on an opportunity to showcase Mark Witton’s artwork.)

*   The steppe mammoth, which was the first mammoth to inhabit cold, northerly regions. Surprisingly, for most of their evolutionary history, mammoths lived in warmer climates and probably didn’t have much hair. The steppe mammoth broke the mould by colonizing Siberia and adapting to frigid conditions. Because of this, it was massive - upper estimates for this species go up to 14,300 kg!

*   The woolly mammoth, the one everyone knows, which is a direct descendant of the steppe mammoth. It was the last mammoth to go extinct, with the last surviving population dying out on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean, 4,000 years ago. That’s more than half a millennium younger than the Great Pyramid of Giza!

*   The Columbian mammoth, thought to be the result of steppe mammoths and woolly mammoths interbreeding. Unlike its ancestors, it preferred more temperate climes, and was found across much of the contiguous US and Mexico. Anything further north was woolly territory. It was also huge, rivaling the southern mammoth in size.

*   The pygmy mammoth, a species which resulted from Columbian mammoths ending up on California’s Channel Islands (which were then merged into a larger superisland, called Santa Rosae). Due to its small island habitat, it was drastically reduced in size, and stood only ~2 metres tall.

*   The Cretan dwarf mammoth, which, like the pygmy mammoth, underwent insular dwarfism. As its name suggests, it inhabited Crete, and it was the smallest of all mammoths - a metre tall and 310 kg in weight. It’s possible that Cretan dwarf mammoth skulls could have inspired the cyclopes of Ancient Greek folkore.

*   The Sardinian mammoth, another pintsize pachyderm from the Mediterranean. In terms of size, it was roughly midway between the Cretan and pygmy species, weighing a little over half a ton. Both the Cretan dwarf and Sardinian mammoth are considered descendants of the steppe mammoth.

So, that covers all the confirmed mammoth species. I should add, however, that there are also a bunch of possible-but-dubious species, supposed hybrids, and distinct mammoth subspecies known.

It’s also quite interesting that most people think of woolly tundra-dwellers when they hear “mammoth”, but in reality most mammoths lived in warmer regions, likely had minimal hair, and would have looked quite similar to modern Asian elephants.

Anyway, thanks for reading everybody, have a great day.
