## Does anyone really know what colours dinosaurs were? So often they are depicted as drab browns and greens, why is that?

We actually do, for a handful of them, and I’m not talking about living birds. So far, the extinct dinosaurs whose colouration we know are the following:

*   Sinosauropteryx, a small, dainty theropod from early Cretaceous China. It was reddish-brown and white with a banded pattern on its tail, not unlike that of a ring-tailed lemur.

*   Psittacosaurus, a relatively small and abundant ceratopsian from early Cretaceous Asia. Its underbelly would have been markedly paler than its back, and it had some kind of markings like spots or stripes.

*   Archaeopteryx, an early relative of birds from the end of the Jurassic period. It’s generally thought to have been mainly black, although one study suggested this might not be certain.

*   Anchiornis, another bird-like Jurassic dinosaur. This one was black, white and grey, with a crest of red feathers on its head. It was also the first extinct animal to have its colouration analyzed.

*   Microraptor, an enigmatic dinosaur which glided from tree to tree using four feathered wings, and actually coexisted with Sinosauropteryx. In life, it was black all over, and its feathers were iridiscent and glossy.

*   Borealopelta, an armoured ankylosaur from Cretaceous Canada. It was reddish brown, with a fairer hue on its underbelly. This is called countershading, a form of camouflage, which implies, rather eerily, that this fortified giant was threatened by predators.

*   Caihong, a fairly obscure bird-like dinosaur from the Late Jurassic in China. Analyses indicate that it was mainly black, but with more colourful iridescent feathering around the head and neck. Definitely one of the most interesting dinosaur colour schemes we’ve found.

*   Cruralispennia, an even more obscure dinosaur from the order Enantiornithes, which were like the passerines of the Mesozoic - small, common, diverse birds. We know that this one was quite dark in colour, and probably had some kind of glossiness, but that’s about it.

*   Inkayacu, which had perhaps my favourite colour scheme on this list. This was actually a penguin from the Eocene epoch, after the K-Pg mass extinction, but it’s a dinosaur regardless. Its feathers would have been grey and reddish-brown, in contrast to modern penguins’ black and white.

So, I’m sure many of you are asking the obvious question by now. How on Earth can we possibly know these things? Well, bones aren’t the only things which become fossilized when dinosaurs die.

Sometimes, dead dinosaurs are exceptionally well-preserved, and their feathers fossilize too. In extremely rare cases, we can even see the microscopic imprints left on these feathers by melanosomes. Melanosomes are organelles in the cells of animals which synthesize and store melanin - a common pigment.

By meticulously analyzing these imprints and comparing them to the melanosomes of modern animals (usually birds), paleontologists can discover what kind of colour they were responsible for creating, and thus, what colours the dinosaur would have been in life.

It’s an exciting science, and I can’t wait to see which prehistoric colour scheme is next to be unveiled.
