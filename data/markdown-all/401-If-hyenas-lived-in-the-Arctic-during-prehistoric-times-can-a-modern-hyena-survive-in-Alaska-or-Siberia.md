## If hyenas lived in the Arctic during prehistoric times, can a modern hyena survive in Alaska or Siberia?

I assume you’re referring to the recent discovery of Chasmaporthetes fossils in the Yukon; it should be said that these hyenas are quite different to most modern hyenas, coming from an extinct lineage of the family.

However, it is known that numerous subspecies of the extant spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta were found in very cold climates. The cave hyena, C. c. spelaea, ranged from Spain to Siberia, and C. c. ultima is known from Ice Age China. During glacial periods, these areas would be colder than they are today.

However, these were both distinct subspecies, and must have had some adaptations for the cold. Nevertheless, it seems that modern hyenas can be impressively tolerant of low temperatures, and get by just fine in the snowy winters living in zoos in Toronto, Estonia and Saxony.

In fact, it seems that under these conditions, spotted hyenas naturally develop a thick winter coat. Striped hyenas living in temperate latitudes even do this in the wild, and according to [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Mammals-World-Vol-Carnivores/dp/8496553493 "www.amazon.com") survive in places which sometimes drop to -20 degrees Celsius.

Given that parts of Alaska and Siberia aren’t actually that cold (Alaska’s city of Fairbanks occasionally reaches over 30 degrees C in summer, and some native Siberian peoples are even able to cultivate watermelons), I would say that yes, spotted or striped hyenas could potentially survive in those two locations.
