Hmm, let me think…

Well, there are about 1.2 million species of animal which have currently been identified by zoologists. Therefore, there are at least 1.2 million kinds of animal changing into another kind.

Evolution is a constant process. If you shortened the question to “If evolution is real can you give an example of one kind of animal?”, the same answer would be true.
