I always enjoy seeing the winners of the annual Wildlife Photographer of the Year Competition, which is held by London’s Natural History Museum. There are many categories, but the two big ones are the overall title and the Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year.

The top entries in the latter category are always incredibly impressive. Here are my favourite winning shots and highly commended submissions from previous years.

*   Lounging Leopard, Skye Meaker, 2018 (Leopard, Botswana)

There were so many other exceptional shots from young finalists in this competition, but I had to choose only the ones which really jumped out at me. It’s nice to know that these photographers are getting out and experiencing nature firsthand at such a young age, and they are clearly already very skilled.

Thank you for reading everybody, I hope you enjoyed seeing all these beautiful photographs. Have a great day!
