## Why is Australian wildlife so much more intense/dangerous than the rest of the world?

Is it really? Let’s take a look.

Around 12 of Australia’s 173 snake species are dangerous to humans, including tiger snakes, brown snakes and taipans.

Two crocodile species inhabit the country, the freshwater and the saltwater, but only the latter is a known man-eater. One or two people are killed by Australian crocodiles every year.

There are two spiders which have killed humans (although this hasn’t happened in more than 50 years), the redback spider and the Australian funnel-web spider. That being said, 40+ other Aussie spiders’ bites can cause unpleasant symptoms.

Some insects are also somewhat dangerous, although the most prolific killer of all is actually just the humble Western honey bee. Some people are severely allergic to their venom.

In the seas, there are three sharks which have been responsible for human death; the great white shark, the tiger shark and the bull shark.

In terms of other fish, there are a couple to be wary of; namely the reef stonefish, lionfish and smooth toadfish (a species of puffer).

The marine invertebrates have quite a few lethal species, comprising some molluscs; the blue-ringed octopus and several species of cone snail:

And of course the jellyfish; the common kingslayer, the Irukandji, the sea wasp (okay, technically it’s a cubozoan, not a jellyfish) and the Portuguese man o’ war (which, again, isn’t a jellyfish, but rather a colonial siphonophore).

So, there certainly are a good few dangerous animals in Australia. But is this actually unusual? The first thing to consider is latitude. The country straddles the Tropic of Capricorn, so it’s inevitably more biodiverse than most places closer to the poles.

Despite being effectively one-third desert, Australia is counted among the world’s most biodiverse nations. Because it has more species than, say, the USA, it follows that it should have more venomous or harmful species.

Other biodiverse countries, like India, Indonesia, Colombia, Brazil, and Mexico - i.e. those which are fairly large, reasonably close to the equator, and have a wide range of habitat types - show similar levels of venomous species to Australia.

In fact, if you look specifically at the number of dangerous snake species, Australia is surprisingly far down the list of countries. The United States, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Kenya, Tanzania, India and China all surpass it.

Actual bites from venomous snakes are uncommon in Australia, being over ten times more frequent in South and Southeast Asian countries.

Of the fatal crocodile attacks that occur in the world, the vast, vast majority are perpetrated by the Nile crocodile of Africa. Saltwater crocodiles make up a small portion of the killings, and even then most deaths occur in Asia or Melanesia, not Australia.

As for spiders, two fatal species is hardly statistically significant enough to compare Australia to the many countries which have one. I can, however, say that Brazil has more deadly spiders, at three species - the Brazilian wandering spider, the Chilean recluse and Sicarius ornatus.

In terms of insects, Australia definitely doesn’t stand out, as its most dangerous one, the honey bee, is found in literally every country. Now for the marine wildlife. Three man-eating sharks is nothing to write home about, I’m afraid.

The great white is found in the waters of all but 16 of the world’s 179 coastal countries:

And it overlaps with the bull shark and tiger shark on practically every tropical coastline. As for the other dangerous sea creatures, Australia does have quite a lot, thanks in large part to the Great Barrier Reef. However, the Malay Archipelago area (the Coral Triangle) likely has more marine diversity.

So, in summary, it is true that there are harmful species counted among Australia’s wildlife. However, this isn’t unusual for a tropical country. In places like Western Europe, the US, and Canada, Australia is the only country in the tropics which has a large impact on the public consciousness, because it is the most Westernized.

How many Australian actors, singers, stereotypes or cities can you name? Probably quite a few, especially if you live somewhere like the United States. Now try the same for Brazil, or Indonesia. It is for this reason that Australia seems to us to be uniquely exotic and dangerous.
