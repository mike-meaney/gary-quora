## What country has the most diversity in biomes? So biomes like tundra, desert, temperate forest, shrubland/woodland, grassland etc?

China would seem to be the holder of that title. This is a map of China’s climate zones:

According to Koppen’s system, it has an impressive 18 different biomes. On the eastern coast of the island of Hainan, there are tropical monsoon forests, created by the tropical heat and high rainfall brought by the warm Kuroshio current.

Most of Hainan, however, is less rainy, and experiences a tropical savannah climate.

Moving north, the southeastern quarter of mainland China is virtually covered by subtropical biomes. A la the Köppen system, there are four of these here. In the flat plain of the Yangtze basin, you have dry-winter and humid subtropical climates.

I should also add that there are “oceanic” areas in the higher parts of this plain, more similar to Western Europe in climate.

A bit to the west, in the Hengduan Mountains, you’ll find two types of highland subtropical climates.

There’s also a small basin in the Hengduan Mountains which is very dry, and is classified as hot steppe.

Moving westward, we arrive at the Himalayas proper. The soaring altitude here makes conditions extremely cold, and most of it is essentially tundra.

Some of the highest peaks are so cold that they are glaciated year round - ice caps, in other words.

As wind blows moisture from the south, it hits the Himalayas and is forced to rise, condensing into clouds as it cools. By the time these clouds have crossed the range, they’ve already dropped most of their water, creating an extremely arid region to the north - the Gobi desert.

Around the fringes of this desert, things get a little rainier, and you have cold, semi-arid steppes.

Before we move to the northeast of China, I should just mention that near its border with Kazakhstan, there are two biomes which are not found elsewhere in the country. One is the taiga, which looks something like this:

(The picture is from the Kazakh side of the border, but the landscape is similar nonetheless)

The second biome here is the warm-summer humid continental climate, which is also found in - among other places - New York, much of Eastern Europe, and Hokkaido. Again, the picture is from Kazakhstan, as I couldn’t find any for this tiny and sparsely populated portion of China.

For our last few biomes, we sweep across the Gobi and arrive at the northeastern wing of China - Inner Mongolia, Manchuria and the like. Here, we’ll find more highly seasonal, continental biomes, such as the widespread hot-summer continental:

The slightly cooler warm-summer continental:

And, in the far northern reaches of Heilongjiang, the chilly subarctic region:

All in all, I think that’s all eighteen biomes covered. As you can see, China is a country of extremely diverse landscapes, and its wildlife and culture is likewise varied. Unfortunately, it is also a nation which is putting serious stress on its environment, so hopefully its many wild places will be preserved before it’s too late.
