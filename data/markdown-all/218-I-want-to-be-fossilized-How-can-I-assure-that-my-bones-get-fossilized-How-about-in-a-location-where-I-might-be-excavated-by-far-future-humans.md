## I want to be fossilized. How can I assure that my bones get fossilized? How about in a location where I might be excavated by far-future humans?

Don’t want to wait tens of thousands of years for your remains to fossilize naturally? No matter, you can get it done in a day using the method Evan Saitta did in July 2018! Here’s a simple and easy recipe for [Easy-Bake Fossils](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-07/fm-ef072018.php "www.eurekalert.org").

Ingredients:

*   1 human corpse
*   1 clay tablet

Equipment:

*   Hydraulic press
*   Human-sized sealed metal container
*   Extra-large high-temperature industrial oven

Directions:

1.  Using the hydraulic press, compress the body into the clay tablet.
2.  Put the tablet into the container.
3.  Put the container into the oven and bake at 220 degrees Celsius for 24 hours.
4.  Chill before serving.

In all seriousness, artificial fossilization is a real thing. In 2018 the paleontologist Evan T. Saitta produced “fossils” of lizard hands (pictured), bird feathers and plants. They were incredibly similar to natural ones - the proteins and fatty acids had disappeared, and there were melanosomes exposed.

In theory, this could work on something as large as a full human cadaver, but needless to say you’d need to scale the equipment way up.
