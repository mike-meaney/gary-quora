## If biological evolution is true, why don't we see species at intermediary stages of development? Are there fishes with legs, that are about to walk on land, or tall monkeys that are losing hair?

The time is 10 million years hence. The dominant species on the Earth is a descendant of Homo sapiens, with an intellect far superior to its present-day relatives. Only a few decades ago, their paleontologists unearthed fossilized skeletons of H. sapiens, and do you know what they said?

They said “This is great! We’ve finally found an intermediary stage between apes and us!”

The point is that to know what transition is being undertaken, in any scenario, not just an evolutionary one, you must not only know the starting point, but the end result. Devonian fish did not look at Tiktaalik and say “Oh look, it’s an intermediary stage between fish and tetrapods.”, because there were no tetrapods at that time. Without knowing the species of the future, we cannot know who’s transitional to who.

The arboreal theropod, Yi Qi, had bat-like wings, and was capable of gliding and weak fluttering. You might think it was going to evolve into some kind of animal with powered flight, but it didn’t. It went extinct. It just goes to show; you can’t predict evolution.
