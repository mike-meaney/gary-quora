As far as I know, no. In fact, there is only one instance of pinnipeds using scent glands at all that I’m aware of.

During mating season, which is in spring by the way, ringed seal bulls are known for secreting a very intense scent using facial glands. In fact, the gland-containing tissue around their eyes swells so much during this season that it appears wet and creased.

I managed to track down a stock photo of this:

You see it? Anyway, this scent is used for marking the boundaries of territories and is so strong that people often report smelling it in empty snow dens when the ringed seal is absent.

The secretion is said to smell vaguely like “gasoline and musty socks”, and ringed seals are known to the local Inuits as tiggak, meaning stinkers. The scent is actually referred to by biologists as the “tiggak odour”.
