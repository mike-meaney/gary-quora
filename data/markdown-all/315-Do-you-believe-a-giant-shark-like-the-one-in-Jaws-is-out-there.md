## Do you believe a giant shark, like the one in Jaws, is out there?

Bruce, the robot shark used in the production of Jaws (also known as the great white turd to Steven Spielberg… it was a frustrating piece of equipment), was about 7.6 metres long.

There are 1870s reports from near Port Fairy, Australia, of a 10.9 metre great white shark, and 1930s ones from New Brunswick, Canada, of an 11.3 meter one. However, these claims have been debunked; the Australian shark was only about 5 metres in truth, and the Canadian one was a basking shark, not a great white.

Two great white sharks known as the KANGA (pictured above) and MALTA specimens respectively were originally estimated to be 6.9 and 7.13 metres long. A number of rebuttals of those estimates were made, but eventually it was confirmed that the original ones were correct.

The legendary shark known as the “Submarine” was said to be well over 7 metres long, and if that were correct, he would be a Bruce-sized great white. However, we simply don’t know how big it really was. Some say its size was exaggerated - others say it’s all a hoax.

However, there are reports of non-great whites growing to huge sizes. One tiger shark was apparently 7.4 metres long and over 3 tons in weight; however, this is unverified. The frightening Greenland shark (an Arctic species which can evidently snatch reindeer, moose and even polar bears from the ice) does grow to 7.4 metres, although it’s more slender than a great white.

Then there are of course the filter-feeding sharks which outsize both great whites and Bruce from Jaws. Basking sharks can be 8 metres long, and the immense whale shark - 14 ton giants - grows to 9.8.

Lastly, there are many extinct prehistoric sharks which were as big as or bigger than the one in Jaws. Among these are Carcharocles megalodon (max. 17.9m), C. chubutensis (12.2m), C. angustidens (9.3m), Cretoxyrhina (max. 8m), Otodus (9m) Ptychodus (10m), Cetorhinus (8m), Parotodus (9m), Leptostyrax (9.8m), Cardabiodon (max. 9m) and Cosmopolitodus hastalis (8m).
