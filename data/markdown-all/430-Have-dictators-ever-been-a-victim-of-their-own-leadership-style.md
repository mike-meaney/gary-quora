Certainly, and in many ways too. However, the most darkly ironic example might just be the death of Joseph Stalin.

The year was 1950, and it was beginning to look like the leader of the Soviet Union was in poor health. He spent close to half the year in his dacha (country house) in what’s now Georgia. The following year, he did the same.

So, in January of the year after that, Stalin’s private physician, Vladimir Vinogradov, understandably suggested that he should retire. When Lavrenti Beria (a notorious man in his own right and the director of the KGB) told Joseph Stalin this, the dictator allegedly “went into an indescribable rage” and shouted “Put him in chains! Put him in chains!”. These are quotes from an article which appeared in Moscow News at the time.

So Vinogradov was imprisoned and tortured by the KGB. He was but one of countless doctors to meet this cruel treatment in what came to be known as the “Doctor’s Plot”. The paranoid Stalin accused a slew of (mainly Jewish) doctors of conspiring to overthrow him and murder various politicians, and the secret police locked them up and tortured them until they confessed.

Fast-forward a little over a year to March 1953. Stalin was found semi-conscious in his dacha near Moscow, having suffered a brain hemorrhage. He remained in this stupor for several days before he finally died on the 5th. It’s possible that he was murdered, and if so Lavrenti Beria may even have something to do with it.

We may never know for sure, but one would wonder if the dictator would have died if hundreds of Soviet doctors- including his own personal physician - weren’t being tortured in prison at the time. It certainly wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest.
