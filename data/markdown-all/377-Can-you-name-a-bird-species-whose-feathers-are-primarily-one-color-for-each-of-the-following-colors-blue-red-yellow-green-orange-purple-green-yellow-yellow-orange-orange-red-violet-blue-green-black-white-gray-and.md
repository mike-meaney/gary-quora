Sure. These are my picks off the top of my head, with a fun fact on each to keep things interesting.

Blue \- Spix’s macaw. It is sadly extinct outside of captivity and famous due to the film Rio.

Red - northern cardinal. It gets its name from its red plumage’s resemblance to the vestments of cardinals in the Catholic Church.

Green \- Guinea turaco. Turacos are found only in Africa and are the only birds in the whole world which have true green pigment in their feathers.

Purple \- violet-backed starling. The females are a rather dull brown and the chicks reddish, but the adult males are this brilliant colour.

Green-yellow \- European greenfinch. Huge numbers of them have died off due to a highly infectious deadly disease which has spread among them.

Yellow-orange \- orange oriole. It’s a member of the New World orioles, native to the Americas, which - despite incredible similarities - are unrelated to actual orioles.

Orange-red \- scarlet tanager. Despite the name, it’s not actually a tanager, it’s in the cardinal family.

Violet \- purple honeycreeper. When it hears the call of a ferruginous pygmy owl, it comes out to find and harass the potential predator.

Black \- Vogelkop superb bird-of-paradise. This amazing bird is about as black an organism you could possibly hope to find, with its plumage absorbing an unprecedented 99.95% of the light that hits it.

Grey \- kagu. It's endemic to the island of New Caledonia and is unique among avians for having structures called nasal corns on its nostrils.
