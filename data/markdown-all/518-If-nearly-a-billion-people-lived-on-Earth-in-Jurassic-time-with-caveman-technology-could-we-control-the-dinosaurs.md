Yes.

And those are just (some of) the recent ones. The page doesn’t include the Pleistocene megafauna - Paleolithic man killed off mammoths, giant sloths with scythes for claws, 400-kilogram saber-toothed cats, marsupial lions, rhino-sized wallabies, lizards the size of great white sharks, giant fossas, the largest-ever bears, dire wolves, terror birds, bear-sized beavers, tyrant polar bears, lemurs as big as gorillas, tortoises with spiked tail clubs and flightless birds twice as tall as men.

I’m pretty sure our Stone Age humans would figure out that a large theropod was so top-heavy that a single fall would kill it. Entire herds of sauropods/ceratopsians/iguanodonts could be slaughtered with a [buffalo jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffalo_jump "en.wikipedia.org"), and smaller predators’ numbers would fall steeply after inevitable overhunting. In reality, no conventional tetrapod, real or hypothetical, can stand up to humans with a will to survive.
