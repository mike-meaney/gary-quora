## Is the southern elephant seal one of the largest land carnivores (it can live both on water and land so let's just say land" animal) ever on earth?"

It depends what you mean by “carnivore”. If you mean carnivoran, as in a member of the order Carnivora:

Then the answer is yes. It is the largest extant carnivore and no prehistoric ones which have been so far unearthed beat it in size. Some come close though, like the terrifying Pontolis magnus.

However, if you mean “carnivore” as in a meat-eating animal, then no. Currently, most sources cite Spinosaurus aegypticus (although T Rex could make a comeback) as the largest ever theropod and thus the largest ever land carnivore, at a maximum of 20.9 tonnes, blowing the seal’s 4 out of the water.

I know that you said “one of the largest”, but even still, no. Here are some other theropod estimated weights, keeping in mind that a bull southern elephant seal weighs a maximum of 4 tonnes.

*   T Rex - 18.5 tonnes
*   Carcharodontosaurus \- 15.1 tonnes
*   Giganotosaurus \- 13.8 tonnes
*   Acrocanthosaurus - 7.3 tonnes
*   Oxalaia - 7 tonnes
*   Tyrannotitan - 7 tonnes
*   Chilantaiasaurus - 6 tonnes
*   Suchomimus - 5 tonnes

Note: I gave the upper estimates in this list. Going with the lower estimates, all but the last two, Acro and Carcharodontosaurus are still safe.

Even after the passing of the dinosaurs, there were larger “land”\* carnivores than the southern elephant seal. This is Purussaurus, an 8.4-tonne caiman which lived 20-5 million years ago.

\*Technically, this isn’t considered a land predator since it’s semiaquatic, but it is a land animal by the definition you gave in your question.
