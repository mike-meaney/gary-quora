Flatulence is observed in the vast majority of mammals (whereas no birds fart). While it’s possible that bats don’t fart either because their digestion is so fast. the only confirmed exception to the rule I am aware of are sloths.

Which is strange, given that their metabolism is so slow. However, the endosymbiotic microbes in their digestive tract simply don’t produce enough methane for it to be necessary that it is passed out the back door.

Instead, the methane is absorbed by the bloodstream and exhaled. Yes, that’s correct, sloths breathe their own fart gas.
