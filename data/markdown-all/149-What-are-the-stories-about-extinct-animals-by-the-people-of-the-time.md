Up until around 11,000 years ago, the world was a very different place than what it is today. Countless varieties of giant animals, collectively known as the Pleistocene megafauna, roamed many corners of the globe. Sadly, virtually all of this megafauna is now extinct, with Africa really being the only continent which retained a semblance of its former richness.

Of course, there were humans around back then who witnessed these animals. Indeed, those people are likely the culprits behind their disappearance. However, it seems very possible that the memory of some of these beasts has been preserved, through long-running oral traditions. First of all, we’ll consider the giant snake Wonambi naracoortensis.

Wonambi was a constrictor snake which measured six metres in length, making it larger than any serpent alive today. It was a member of the very interesting family Madtsoiidae, an ancient group which pre-dated (and survived) the extinction that wiped out the non-bird dinosaurs. I describe the madtsoiids in more detail [here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-extinct-animals-that-would-be-a-major-problem-if-they-were-to-magically-exist-today/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com").

It has been proposed that Wonambi naracoortensis may have been the origin of the famous Rainbow Serpent of Aboriginal folklore. In the mythology of many Australian peoples, the Rainbow Serpent is seen as a creator god, a deity who brought life to the barren world, during its primeval, formative period (the Dreamtime).

In fact, Wonambi itself is one of the Rainbow Serpent’s many names. Another more common name is Yurlunggur, which also happens to be the name of a different Australian madtsoiid, from the Miocene epoch. It was even bigger, perhaps up to nine metres long!

Back then, there were no humans around to encounter it, however.

Anyway, time to move on to another legendary creature of Australia: the bunyip. It is said to lurk in swamps, rivers, marshes, creeks and the like, and feed on crayfish. Most supposed eyewitness accounts describe it as a dog- or seal-like creature with a shaggy coat of matted fur, a rounded head, and in some cases a long neck.

That being said, there are many other descriptions which have been used for the bunyip. Some say it is more reptilian, or even like a starfish, while the first ever written account says that it is bird-like and quite similar to a cassowary. It is also sometimes said to prey on women and children.

There have been a few animals which have been considered as possible sources of inspiration for the conventional, mammalian bunyip. First of all, leopard seals - occasionally, these (traditionally Antarctic) animals end up swimming up rivers in Australia.

There are also possible prehistoric origins. Early Aboriginals would have encountered a variety of different diprotodontids. These were essentially giant wombats, with the biggest species of all - Diprotodon optatum - being the largest marsupial ever to live. It’s estimated to have weighed nearly three tonnes!

An even more exotic possible explanation is the strange Palorchestes. Its name means “ancient dancer”, and it was truly a mishmash of a beast. It had the proboscis of a tapir, the prehensile tongue of a giraffe, the build of a bear, the pouch of a marsupial, and was the size of a horse. Ecologically, it probably had a similar lifestyle to giraffes and extinct ground sloths.

(I should add that some research has questioned whether Palorchestes really had a trunk. It may have had more of a wombat-like nose with prehensile lips)

The last animal of folklore I’m going to talk about hails from far away from Australia, over in Brazil. It’s called the mapinguari, which very roughly translates to “thing with a crooked foot”. This monster is said to be tall, hairy, vaguely humanoid, and one-eyed. Some accounts also refer to a mouth on the stomach.

Again, discussions have arisen as to whether this mythical creature could be a memory of a real, but extinct, one. In this case, the prime suspects are the giant ground sloths, such as Mylodon. There were quite a few species in Brazil, and they were all very hairy and semi-bipedal. It’s easy to imagine that stories of these sloths could eventually evolve into a legend of a shaggy humanoid beast.

So, I’m sure there are other examples, but those are the three that immediately sprung to mind for me. It’s nice to think that, though these amazing animals are now gone, there is a chance that they’ve been immortalized through the oral traditions of indigenous peoples.

Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed, have a great day.
