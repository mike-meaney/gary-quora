Definitely.

This is a Velociraptor compared to a human:

Velociraptors may have been nimble, but their light frame would snap like a matchstick between the jaws of a hyena.

Spotted hyenas have the most powerful bite force of any living land carnivore, and can chew through iron and steel. They have thick, long and extremely muscular necks, and are understood to be practically impervious to pain.

Velociraptors, for all their glorification, are only slightly faster than spotted hyenas, so Iâ€™m pretty sure this dinosaur is screwed unless he bolts.
