There aren't any photos of them, but they are thought to be real.

The ‘leoger’ is a reported Panthera hybrid, but sadly whenever one is born, it's dead. This is probably because of a genetic growth disorder that causes them to “overgrow” in the womb.

However, in local Indian folklore, there is a beast called the ‘dogla’, allegedly a tiger-leopard hybrid, but most scientists doubt this is genetically true.

Big cats are subject to a host of mutations in colour patterns, so it is easy to imagine that this is what a dogla really is. The same explanation can also be applied to reported “leoger skins” sold.
