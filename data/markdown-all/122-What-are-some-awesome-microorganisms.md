Ooh, now this is an interesting one. Not often that the microbial world gets attention in questions like these. Here goes, anyway.

*   Valonia ventricosa: This alga is one of the largest single-celled organisms in the world, as it can grow to be up to 5 centimeters in diameter. To adapt to this huge size, Valonia has many nuclei, not just one as most eukaryotes do. They can be bright green, teal, silver or even black, depending on how many chloroplasts they have.

*   Midichloria mitochondrii: The fact that this bacterium is named after the midichlorians of Star Wars is cool as it is, but that’s not the only interesting thing about it. M. mitochondrii is so named because it lives within the mitochondria of animals (ticks, specifically) - in fact it’s the only organism in the world which does this.

*   Sputnik virophage: Technically, this is a virus, so some wouldn’t consider it a microorganism, but I’ll put it here anyway. The Sputnik virophage is a parasite of other viruses - in this case, the giant virus Mamavirus. Mamavirus in turn parasitizes the protozoan Acanthamoeba, which itself is a parasite of an animal. This makes Sputnik a parasite of a parasite of a parasite.

*   Mixotricha paradoxa: This protozoan, which lives inside termites, isn’t just one organism - it’s five different ones. On the surface of its cell, countless symbiotic bacteria of three different species act as mini flagella, aiding locomotion. These give it a “furry” appearance. Meanwhile, a fourth species of bacterial symbiote lives inside the cell, helping digest the protist’s food.

*   Rubberneckia: This unnamed microbe, which also lives in termites, nicknamed “Rubberneckia”, has shattered the notion that full, 360 degree rotation of organs is impossible. This organism’s head is constantly rotating clockwise - but how does it not snap? It turns out that part of its cell membrane is actually fluid, not solid; incredible, right?

(I couldn’t find any pictures, a similar, related species is below)

*   Pandoravirus: Another virus, I know, but whatever. Pandoravirus is a true giant among viruses - at 1 micrometer in diameter, it’s ten to twenty times the size of your typical virus. It’s also the most complex, with 2.5 million base pairs in their genome (of DNA, not RNA). Most viruses have only a few thousand.

*   Desmidiales: Commonly known as simply desmids, the members of this family of algae are not only often beautiful, they’re quite unique, too. They usually have bilateral symmetry (like us), as their cells are divided into two identical segments. As far as I know, desmids are the only microbes which are bilateral, rather than radial or asymmetrical.

Well that was a change from the answers I usually give. It was interesting to research these different forms of single-celled organism; I hope you’ve found it interesting too.
