André Thevet was an explorer and geographer, born in 1516 in France. He travelled to various parts of the world, most notably Brazil, where he established a colony, but also Africa, the Middle East, Madagascar, the Canaries, Florida, Canada, and the Caribbean.

He wrote about the animals, plants and native peoples he encountered on his journeys, and is well known for his factual and informative style. Despite this, he described many creatures which seem, well… questionable.

An illustration of a sloth in Thevet’s book. Among the things he wrote about sloths is that they never eat.

One such creature was the Succarath of Patagonia. This beast is described as having the “face of a lion or even that of a man”, and using its very long hairy tail to “hide its pups that it places on its back.” Allegedly, it was hunted by the local Patagonians for its fur, which was used to make warm garments.

This is the Succarath, as illustrated in his book:

And there are many more strange animals which Thevet allegedly observed on his travels. There’s the Camphruch \- this was an amphibious unicorn which dwelt in Indonesia, and had the front half of a deer and the hind legs of a goose. Its horn, which was over a meter long, was used to catch fish.

André Thevet is especially well-known for the sea monsters which featured on some of the maps he drew. One such sea monster is the Aloés, a fish which “resembled a goose”, and was red and yellow in colour. Some cryptozoologists point out its resemblances to a plesiosaur, but IMO it could just as well be a whale or seal with a seabird on its back.

Here are some more bizarre sea monsters, which I can’t find much information on:

On the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, he described an especially large number of strange beasts. One of these was the Yuanat, which was described as a serpent with four feet like those of a bird, and the dorsal spine of a fish on its back. This is how it was illustrated in Thevet’s book:

While the drawing makes it look very alien altogether, the description is actually quite in keeping with that of an iguana, several species of which are found on Hispaniola. Several of the fantastical animals which he describes actually match up pretty well with existing species, but have illustrations which are far from the truth.

Indeed, it’s likely that all the above beasts were based on real animals, albeit through fleeting observations or oral descriptions. The Succarath, for example, may have come from a hazy account of an opossum or puma. That being said, I don’t know where the hell he came up with the Camphruch, the amphibious goose-unicorn.
