This is a very interesting question, and not one I can answer definitely.

If I was to make a guess, I would say it would be tarsiers.

Allow me to explain. So, tarsiers are the only “prosimians” which are Anthropoids, also known as simians, haplorhines, or simply dry-nosed primates. While the titular characteristic of dry-nosed primates is the absence of a wet, black rhinarium (like most mammals have), they are also characterized by greater intelligence and EQ.

Being visual (just look at their eyes), arboreal predators, hunting agile insect prey in a highly complex environment, tarsiers would need their intelligence as much as any strepsirrhine, but would likely have more of it due to its taxonomic placement.
