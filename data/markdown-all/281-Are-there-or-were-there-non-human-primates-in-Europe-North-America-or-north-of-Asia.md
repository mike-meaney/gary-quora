There are still non-human primates in Europe today, although not many of them. On the Rock of Gibraltar, there is a population (of mysterious origins) of Barbary macaques. There are currently around 230 macaques in Gibraltar, and their numbers are actually on the rise.

Barbary macaques are also known, misnomerically, as Barbary apes, as they’re tailless (unlike all other monkeys). As a random fun fact, the King of Greece was killed by a Barbary macaque in 1920. The monkey was a pet of one of the king’s staff.

However, Europe is generally too cold for primates. But millions of years ago, in the Miocene epoch, the continent was actually a hotspot of great ape species, as it had a subtropical climate. Among them were Griphopithecus, Kenyapithecus, Pierolapithecus, Anoiapithecus, Dryopithecus, Hispaniopithecus, and Rudapithecus.

About 9 million years ago, an event known as the Vallesian Crisis occurred, where many forests gave way to grasslands due to a drying climate. This caused most of the hominids to die out, although a few remained, like Oreopithecus, Graecopithecus and Ouranopithecus (pictured).

For unknown reasons, it’s been a lot longer since Northern America has had native primates, aside from us. I assume you were referring to that region, rather than the continent North America, which includes Mexico and Central America, thus having plenty of primates

The last Northern American primates we know of were around during the Eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago. Here, there were relatives of today’s tarsiers and members of a now-extinct primate group known as the omomyids (pictured). The Eocene was one of the hottest-ever periods in Earth’s history, so it’s no surprise that primates were around here.

As for Northern Asia, the answer is - disappointingly - no. The northernmost Asian primates are Japanese macaques, which you’ll find up to about 40 degrees north. Beyond that latitude, there aren’t even any primate fossils which have been found.

In any case, hopefully this answer has been of interest. Thanks for reading!
