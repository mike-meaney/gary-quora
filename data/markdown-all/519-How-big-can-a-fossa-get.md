In terms of length, adult males can reach a maximum of 1.5 metres, with the tail making up a little under half of that measurement. The heaviest scientifically verified fossas weigh 8.6 kilograms, however; there are some reports of 20 kilogram individuals.

There is a Pleistocene species of fossa, Cryptoproctra spelaea, also known as the giant fossa, which was significantly larger than any of the modern species. Estimates currently put it at 17â€“20 kg, and its large size was an adaptation for hunting giant lemurs like Paleopropithecus.

Edit: Turns out there is actually an unverified report of a modern fossa which was 30 kilograms in weight.
