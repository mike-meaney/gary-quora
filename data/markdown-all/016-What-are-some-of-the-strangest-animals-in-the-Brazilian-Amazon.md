The Amazon Rainforest is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth: as it’s home to millions of species, many of which we’ll probably never discover, I had a hard time deciding on the choicest specimens to discuss. However, I’m pretty happy with this selection below.

Here are my choices, at least some of which you hopefully haven’t heard of. Buckle up, and enjoy!

*   The kinkajou. This adorable critter is perhaps the most frugivorous mammal in the world; over 90% of its diet is fruit. It also loves flower nectar, and thus acts as an important pollinator! With a prehensile tail, it’s highly specialized for living in the trees - so much so that it was originally thought to be a primate. However, it’s a carnivoran, related to raccoons and the like.

*   The white bellbird, the loudest bird on the planet. In 2019, the male’s otherworldly mating call - which resembles an ear-splitting electronic beep - was measured at 125 decibels. That’s literally louder than a chainsaw, or a thunder clap. The male bird’s appearance is likewise bizarre; all white, except for a fleshy black wattle which dangles from his beak. The females are much less flashy, and olive-coloured.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cf96058247e23a112d1e6abbfa0ee21d-lq)

*   The Amazon milk frog. This is the only vertebrate in the world which has blue blood - the lining of the mouth is blue, and injured individuals bleed blue too. Juveniles also have a bluish tinge overall due to their skin being very thin. Arthropods also have blood of this colour, since theirs is filled with hemocyanin, not hemoglobin. However, I think it’s more likely that this frog just has blue pigment in its bloodstream.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d8a92a0d3eab36d62d4341ae75ebe0ed-lq)

*   The notorious candiru. This parasitic fish is often claimed to have the grisly habit of entering human urethras, even swimming up streams of urine to get there. However, the evidence for this is anecdotal at best, and it’s probably not true. However, what the candiru does do is suck the blood of larger fish by wedging itself in their gills and latching on. That horror alone justifies its inclusion.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b6efe20e5e769fbb390cbed4df2bfe1-lq)

*   Coral. In only 2016, scientists made the incredible discovery that there is a huge coral reef system in the mouth of the Amazon River. Spanning over 9,300 square kilometres, the Amazon Reef is a totally unique ecosystem - owing this to the fact that for parts of the year, it’s clouded in the mud spewed out by the river, which blocks out the sun. The water is also much less saline than that tolerated by any other corals.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5480bd6da2a9cca4739f1609c650334b-lq)

*   The diminutive bush dog, a lesser-known relative of the maned wolf. Ironically, it’s the anatomical opposite of its cousin - while the maned wolf is 90% legs, the bush dog is a stubby little pupper. They hunt in packs, and usually feed on giant rodents like capybaras and pacas. However, in numbers they can take even larger prey - one pack was seen hunting a quarter-ton tapir, fifty times the size of a bush dog!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ee99b0719db84e6e8815d3c74aef1047-lq)

*   The oilbird. This nocturnal feathered friend is so unique that it has a taxonomic family of its own. It’s almost like a bird trying to be a bat; it roosts in huge colonies in caves, and it’s one of the very few birds which can perform echolocation, by producing high-frequency clicks. Its night vision is much better, though - its eyes have an extremely high density of rod cells, a composition comparable to deep sea fish.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-72394f49e3772815430e9cf0078f2d4e-lq)

*   The aptly named paradoxical frog, which is perhaps the only animal that grows down instead of up. After their eggs hatch, the tadpoles become massive - at up to 27 cm long, they’re the longest tadpoles in the world. Eventually, they begin to metamorphose into a fully developed frog, but by the time the process is complete, they may be as little as a quarter of their original size.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3b5f5429655859805fbd1ecdfb64aced-lq)

*   The tamandua knifefish, a testament to just how murky and muddy Amazonian rivers can get. It dwells near the bed of deep streams, places choked with so much silt that the water is pitch black. Because of this, it’s completely blind, has no pigmentation, and navigates using electrical fields. It gets its name from its long snout, used for sucking up prey, which resembles that of an anteater (tamandua).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6b1d032a0e1eafbaeb002bf30f503b7a-lq)

*   Socratea exorrhiza - a plant, yes, but an interesting one - and one which was misunderstood. For unknown reasons, this palm tree has bizarre stilt roots. One scientist hypothesized that they could grow a new, upright trunk if the tree was knocked down; another that they allowed it to travel to better lighting conditions. These were later disproven, but the popular myth of the “walking tree” still persists.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7e84cf59b64ea9ba217bbdf8236a89bb-pjlq)

*   The very underrated short-eared dog, a reclusive and little-known canine. They’re very unique among the dog family, much more similar to cats in many ways - solitary, jungle-dwelling, and nocturnal. The males are significantly smaller than the females, again like many felines, and during the mating season they secrete musk from their tail glands, and produce noises which are reportedly similar to that of owls.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ec955f779193ea52f98d703d35ee7f6e-lq)

*   The incredible hoatzin. The chicks of this unspeakably unique bird have claws, used for climbing, on their wings - a vestige of their reptilian ancestry. It mainly eats leaves, unlike other birds, which ferment in its multi-chambered digestive system, similar to that of a cow. It’s often known as the stinkbird because of this fermentation process, and its esophagus is so large that it makes the bird a terrible flyer.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-65848b06cfe0612cde202ce1459b19af-lq)

*   The emerald tree boa. This species isn’t particularly obscure - I’m sure you’ve seen pictures of it before - but most people don’t know how unique it really is. Proportionally, this boa has the largest fangs of any non-venomous snake; they are terrifyingly overdeveloped. Because of the huge “canine” teeth, it has the scientific name Corallus caninus. Note also the special slots for them in the lower lip.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e5914c23e9958a6dcceca344d6551a06-pjlq)

*   The payara, another owner of frightening fangs. Sometimes referred to as the vampire fish, this predatory fish is found throughout the Amazon River. The teeth on its lower jaw are extremely enlarged, and there are reports of it reaching body lengths of over a metre! That might have been a misidentification of a closely related species, however. In any case, the fangs are used to spear passing smaller fish.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ec98d21aecd2caf0d85c5c6502c0f019-lq)

*   Riggia puyensis, a stomach-churning parasite straight out of Alien. It’s an isopod, related to woodlice, and after mating it finds an armoured catfish (which I’ll mention later) to burrow into. It’ll live out its life inside the fish’ chest cavity, and can be up to a fifth of the host’s size. It leaves a small incision in the skin, from which a stream of its eggs can flow out. A pretty brutal way to give your kids a good start in life.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7321c3cd44b9ddbb7aa35201628a46eb-pjlq)

*   The crab-eating raccoon, a close cousin of the better-known common raccoon. It always associates closely with water, because as its name suggests, it feeds on shellfish such as crabs, crayfish, and clams. That being said, it’s not a picky eater, and has an omnivorous diet. Its molar teeth and cheek muscles are more developed than the common raccoon’s, perfect for cracking open hard shells.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-83abf0ba9bc0ffd5993f6b1c2b940f42-lq)

*   The wood stork. The main reason I think this bird is really cool is because of its featherless head and neck. The bare skin contains a lot of the protein keratin, which gives it a tough, scaly appearance, almost like tree bark - hence the name. It builds huge nests in mangrove trees, by the water’s edge, and stands over a metre tall when fully grown. Like many storks, its food consists mainly of fish and crustaceans.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e22cd0137888cc098a282778a8b316c2-lq)

*   The Orinoco crocodile, which isn’t a resident of the Brazilian Amazon per se, but does inhabit the northern reaches of the Amazon Rainforest. It’s a wonder that it’s little-known, because it’s an absolute monster - the largest specimen known was nearly seven metres long and weighed 1,100 kg! This individual would have been the largest reptile on Earth before its death. It’s also a cannibal, sometimes feeding on other Orinoco crocodiles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-81826b61275e3b6984ab825fcc76c31f-lq)

*   The tambaqui - basically a piranha, but much bigger and… chubbier. Also known as the giant pacu, they can measure over a metre in length, and have substantial reserves of fat for storing nutrients. Unlike piranhas, they actually eat a lot of plant food, and as such have uncannily human-like squared-off teeth. Large specimens are more than a metre long and weigh up to 44 kilograms.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-20233b96b82b4cb3561f3e48627d6b82-lq)

*   The Amazon giant leech. To its credit, it’s exactly what it says on the tin - a disgustingly large bloodsucking worm from the Amazon jungle. Measuring up to 45 centimetres in length (and 10 in width), it’s one of the largest leeches in the world, and believe it or not is kept as a pet by some. When it latches onto its host - often a human - it secretes the unique compound hementin, an enzyme which prevents coagulation.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e8b6af168aed593563baea3495396721-pjlq)

*   Now, a wildcard - the Peruvian tiger, an animal which doesn’t actually exist, but was once thought to. In the Peruvian Amazon, locals had reported seeing a strange big cat, “el tigre”, allegedly reddish in colour, with white stripes. Then in 1996, a pair of unusual pantherine skulls were found - evidence of a new species? Further inspection, however, found they belonged to jaguars, perhaps with aberrant colouration in life.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4dd5e69760d73808646956bd35197555-pjlq)

*   The wonderful great potoo. This bird is one of those creatures that exists somewhere in the grey area between “adorable” and “terrifying”. It has huge eyes, the pupils of which can dilate to astonishing proportions, and its mouth is even more outsize. During the night, it camouflages itself perfectly as a branch on a tree trunk, a disguise with which it can snatch unsuspecting insects flying by.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3d83b3636173d29c50b7523af37a608a-lq)

*   The mata mata. This bizarre-looking freshwater turtle, like the potoo, imitates wood - in this case, it’s camouflaged as a piece of bark, with its head emulating a fallen leaf. When a potential victim swims by, they thrust out their huge necks, opening their mouths to create a negative-pressure vacuum in their throat. The helpless prey is sucked in and eaten - indeed, its name means “I kill” in a local tongue.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5158e2372301f6c23aae50c149ec1549-lq)

*   The discus ray, one of South America’s 30 or so species of river stingrays, or potamotrygonids. Unlike the vast majority of rays, most members of this family live exclusively in freshwater, and the discus ray is no exception. It’s one of the world’s largest freshwater stingrays, its perfectly circular body being up to 1.6 metres across. Even more impressively, large ones weigh more than 100 kg!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-04cdb22d27b20b0d209813675988a6e2-lq)

*   Turtle ants. Cephalotes is an ant genus distributed across the Neotropics, with many of its species found in the Amazon. They carve the tunnels of their nest into trees and branches, which have many openings. Incredibly, to guard these entrances, turtle ants have evolved a whole unique caste of soldiers which have broad, flattened heads - perfect for sealing the doorway. Also, they’re able to glide between trees.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-72f211fded478197a30945278aa64024-lq)

*   The silky anteater, which is by far the world's strangest species of anteater. It's much smaller than its relatives, and lives out its life in the trees - hence the huge, circular claws and prehensile tail. It comes out at night to forage for ants and wasps, hiding in silk cotton trees during the day. It's hypothesised that this is because it's camouflaged to look like the fluffy white seed pods of this tree!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eb4c159c6642a1fc432e219d9343a53d-lq)

*   The king vulture. Out of the Amazon's four vulture species, this one is the largest, comparable in size even to male harpy eagles, which it often overlaps with. Its most striking feature, however, is undoubtedly its colouration - its bald head has shades of red, orange, yellow, black, grey, blue and purple. The king vulture features abundantly in ancient Mayan scriptures too, perhaps being held sacred by that culture.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-27ec675324bb3a78fc8d51ac02713e40-lq)

*   Horned treefrogs, of which there are a handful of species. Like many frogs, they have an incredibly weird reproductive strategy. After mating, the male attaches the newly fertilized eggs onto the female. She has a sticky, gelatin-coated patch on her back, so the eggs adhere there. When they eventually hatch, the babies skip the tadpole phase entirely, emerging as froglets.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-40650b8fc4f9841d6dd188bea25d75cb-pjlq)

*   The piraíba, known scientifically as Brachyplatystoma filamentosum. That’s a mouthful. It’s one of the largest fish in the Amazon River, perhaps exceeded in size only by the arapaima, which I’ll discuss shortly. This catfish can approach three metres in length and weigh in excess of 150 kg. They also make massive annual migrations, travelling from the Amazon Estuary up to the base of the Andes.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d63094e2553996b446569faa71258362-lq)

*   Now, another insect - Onychocerus albitarsis. This beetle is poorly studied as of now, and doesn’t have a common name, but it’s the only animal in the world which delivers venom via its antennae. Yes, its two huge feelers are tipped with scorpion-like hooks which can sting a potential attacker - causing redness and itching for humans. This also means that they’re the only stinging beetles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0fab162e7ed6a414b32fb6736c2c45d4-lq)

*   The yapok. I’ve written about this cute little guy once or twice before. Also known as the water opossum, it’s really the only living semi-aquatic marsupial, swimming using its webbed back feet. Uniquely, both males and females have a pouch - it can seal shut to protect the reproductive organs underwater. Furthermore, it possesses opposable thumbs - which are sixth digits likely adapted from wrist bones!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-434e67b6c443bc3476c46ec61ec59c63-lq)

*   The sword-billed hummingbird, a native of the Andean cloud forests on the far fringes of the Amazon. Its most conspicuous feature is, of course, it’s upward-curving, tube-shaped bill, which is even longer than the body if you exclude the tail. This gives it an edge over competitors, as it can reach nectar which would otherwise be inaccessible. It’s also one of the world’s largest hummingbirds overall.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cb3b543d3ba70185a28e1edcbc457b39-lq)

*   The common Surinam toad. This bizarre, flat amphibian has a reproductive method similar to that of the aforementioned horned treefrog, but it takes it a step further. The female’s back is covered in holes, openings to hollow pockets below the skin. The male pushes the eggs in her, after which they develop and hatch. Then, the baby toads crawl out of all the holes - a trypophobe’s nightmare.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7f500f29764e790f185f5976a56bf9f7-lq)

*   Armoured suckermouth catfish \- told you I’d get to these eventually. This diverse family has a lot of unique quirks. First, there’s obviously their namesake bony armour plating. Then there’s their other namesake - a weird circular mouth on the ventral side, which they feed with using suction. Their “omega irises” are also really strange - when the pupils contract, they become crescent-shaped, like a ring open at one end.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6615d43df00055624c27582f5c1f2e14-lq)

*   The water hyacinth \- another plant, but definitely worthy of note. In the Amazon Basin itself, this aquatic plant has many natural predators. However, when it’s introduced elsewhere, it grows explosively - choking waterways with over 50 kg of matter per square metre. This blocks out the sun, which causes all the other water plants to die, and the bacteria which decompose all the dead plants cause an oxygen crisis in the water.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e0d06a92d6c5260fb769428542aff08d-lq)

*   The tayra, another one of those South American carnivorans that deserve much more attention. It’s a close relative of the northerly wolverine, but with a slimmer build, shorter fur and a longer tail. An adept treetop navigator, it can even sprint along branches, and can be easily identified by its yellow throat patch. Interestingly enough, some tayras have been observed storing inedible plantains in caches so they can ripen.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ff1cbbd258cd930a4395ff47655f9c34-lq)

*   The blue-backed manakin. At a glance, it doesn’t look particularly interesting, although its colours are quite nice. However, what sets it apart its behaviour. When a male tries to impress a female, he’ll perform a courtship dance - but not alone. Rather, males band together to form dance troupes and move in synchrony. Despite being direct competitors, the way they cooperate increases everyone’s chance of getting a date.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-63afc872937ea54bcd5c34913dbfc04b-lq)

*   The caecilian Atretochoana. It has a common name, but not one that’s very suitable for the children reading - and yes, I know what it looks like. Caecilians are limbless amphibians, and this species is incredibly unique because it has no lungs - instead, it breathes through its capillary-covered skin. It’s the only land animal anywhere near its size (it’s ~80 cm long) that can survive without lungs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5550b392c1b86e2feef503e1ee618fba-lq)

*   An Amazonian icon, the piracuru. This is actually the fifth fish on this list that’s been caught by Jeremy Wade, which honestly doesn’t surprise me at all. It’s the largest species of arapaima, and the largest freshwater fish on Earth - some specimens measuring over 4 metres in length and 200 kg in weight. Though it has functioning gills, it also requires air to survive, and frequently surfaces to breathe.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-33f53470f90ce6ee6b37443f75ea1278-lq)

*   The peanut bug, one of the wackiest-looking insects there is. It’s a member of the planthoppers, a group renowned for their fancy headgear, but this one is in a league of its own. It has a huge, hollow structure on its head that extends far past its eyes, and resembles a peanut in shape. This is used to knock against trees, producing sound to attract mates, although it might have the secondary purpose of mimicking a snake’s head.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a9282af780c203823f63d25d5acec000-lq)

*   The jaguarundi, the last of the many carnivoran mammals in this piece. It’s the closest relative of the better-known puma, but it’s much smaller, weighing up to 9 kilograms. Unlike most cats, it’s mainly active during daytime, and its build recalls that of a weasel or otter - short legs, high hips, small head and long body. Indeed, it’s often called the “otter cat”. Jaguarundis can be reddish, grey, or occasionally black.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bc83798e0648c109dff815ba8e613c53-lq)

*   The Amazonian umbrellabird. This all-black bird is the largest passerine bird in South America, measuring up to 55 cm in length. What really makes it (and all umbrellabirds) interesting, though, are the males’ display features. They have a thick crest on top of the head and a long, feathery wattle dangling from the neck, which can be inflated with air. In [some species](https://ebird.org/species/lowumb1 "ebird.org") found outside the Amazon, the wattle is even more pronounced.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eba28000c785a925d1ecf2bd369e5135-lq)

*   The Amazon climbing salamander. Everyone knows that chameleons can shoot out their tongues to catch insects, but few know that climbing salamanders are even better at it. In fact, for their size, the tongue of these amphibians is the fastest and most powerful muscle in the animal kingdom, producing 18,000 watts of power per kilogram. They can retract their extended tongues in a positively ridiculous 3 milliseconds.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f739c84ea246ee53dd3dab2baab6409d)

(A closely related species is pictured above, as it’s the only good photo that illustrates a climbing salamander’s tongue I could find)

*   The glasswing butterfly, an insect which also ranges up towards Mexico. While most butterflies and moths use environmental colouration or mimicry to camouflage, the glasswing is simply transparent. The structure of its wings is insanely intricate; formed of complex microscopic “nanopillars”. These are perfectly shaped to ensure that no light reflects off the transparent wing, no matter what angle a predator is looking from.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f30bd6554e930ffd11a7dd1a4c705e9a-lq)

*   The Amazonian manatee, one of the world’s three species of manatee. It’s much smaller than its West Indian and African counterparts, usually averaging around “only” 200 kilograms in the wild, and it’s the only manatee that lives exclusively in freshwater. During the flood season, they build up fat grazing in the submerged forests, before retreating to deep lakes and rivers and eating next to nothing for months.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-df1b359121cf6a83c6596423131fcb99-lq)

*   The jabiru stork. It’s among the world’s tallest flying birds, and among the largest storks in the world too. The largest jabirus can be roughly three metres from wingtip to wingtip, and stand five feet tall. Their nests are similarly huge, measuring a metre across but - curiously - being almost twice as deep. The name jabiru means “swollen neck” in the language of a local Amazonian ethnic group, which is apt.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7ac2798bfd9769f01b18c387948053ec-lq)

*   The insanely cool-looking sabertooth longhorn beetle. It’s got a wicked pattern on its carapace, and a pair of huge serrated mandibles which give it its name. If you include these frightening jaws, it’s the world’s longest beetle, and it’s nearly as large in mass as the titan beetle, which is also found in the Amazon. It lives over 95% of its life (around a decade) as a larva, spending only a few months in its photogenic adult phase.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a61a067a2fdbb5c21e6784c0c4d9e5e7-lq)

*   The proboscis bat, our last mammal. As its name suggests, it has a little trunk, a pointed fleshy snout which recalls that of a tapir. Its other distinguishing feature is the pair of white stripes which run down its back, likely for camouflage. However, what I find coolest about the proboscis bat is the way it roosts; they sleep in single-file lines along the underside of tree branches.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a90285e21932bd3542044feefac5e808-pjlq)

*   The jabuticaba, our third and final plant. This tree is well-known for its odd fruits, which pepper it all over. They resemble dark, spherical grapes, and grow directly on the trunk in clusters. Beneath the purple skin is sweet, jelly-like flesh, which can be made into a variety of drinks and preserves. The jabuticaba has been farmed by South Americans since before the arrival of Europeans.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1decf7acef683e885a4f429d8a4e64ad-lq)

*   I’ll finish with an outlandish feathered friend - the bearded bellbird. While the females of this species are a dull green-brown, the males are… eye-catching, to the say the least. From the underside of their beak hangs their “beard” - a cluster of thin, fleshy wattles. They remind me of dreadlocks. Like the aforementioned white bellbird, it’s very loud, and has a metallic hammering call which gives it the alternate name anvil-bird.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5d562198fef6b58d4f54e2cabd9a12d2-lq)

If you’ve made it this far, I applaud your attention span - and appetite for juicy, succulent animal knowledge. Those were my top fifty (yes, fifty…) picks for the most bizarre, most interesting and most underrated species found in the vast and diverse Amazon Rainforest.

I had fun writing this answer, so I hope you had some fun reading it! Thank you very much for getting through the whole thing, and have a great day.
