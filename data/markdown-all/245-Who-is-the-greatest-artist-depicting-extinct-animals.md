When I think about the best paleoartists, or at least my personal favourite paleoartists, there are three names that immediately spring to mind.

These guys have incredible talent; not only do they reconstruct animals with painstaking accuracy based on only skeletal remains, but they have creative ideas about the ancient world, and the artwork they produce is breathtaking. Their paintings are like time machines to the prehistoric past.

First, Mauricio Antón. He lives in Spain, and has the distinction of knowing more about sabertooth cats than perhaps anyone else in human history - I have several of his books on this topic alone. His reconstructions are often based partially on firsthand close observations of wildlife in Africa.

His art has a timeless feel to me, and the lifelike detail with which he depicts the animals - especially sabertooths - is amazing.

Secondly, Mark Witton. He’s one of the most well-known modern paleontologists, being especially famous for his research on pterosaurs. He also published The Paleoartist’s Handbook in 2018, which might well be the most comprehensive book on accurately reconstructing prehistoric life.

All his paintings have an unmistakable atmosphere - gritty, but somehow surreal. You’d know they were his from a mile away, with that unique art style. His more speculative depictions are really interesting, too.

Last but not least, Peter Schouten. I became familiar with his work after buying a book on the end-Pleistocene extinction, which he illustrated. He is Australian, and in addition to painting a lot of living wildlife, he has a lot of artwork depicting the fauna of the Pleistocene epoch.

His works are very realistic and bursting with life, and I love the way he creates the texture of animal fur. It’s a shame a lot of the pictures of his art online don’t have great resolution, because it looks incredible in person.

So, I’m by no means saying that these are the three greatest paleoartists of all time, but they’re the ones that are most appealing to me. Artwork from all them has been featured in my answers many times. I recommend you look them up if you enjoyed this, there’s a lot of great art I didn’t feature!

Thanks for reading, have a great day!
