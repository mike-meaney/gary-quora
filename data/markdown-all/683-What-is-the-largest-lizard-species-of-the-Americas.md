If I recall correctly, the largest non-varanid lizard in the world is the giant tegu, also known as the black and white tegu, an inhabitant of Argentina.

My quick search couldn’t find me their largest size in terms of mass, but the maximum length is about 4.5 feet. Furthermore, females can apparently weigh up to 7 kg, and males are said to be “much larger”.

In any case, given that Varanidae is exclusively an Old World group, this tegu should be the largest lizard in the Americas.
