First of all, we need to look into what makes the African savannah the African savannah we know today.

East Africa, which is home to the richest savannahs, is located quite near - as well as in - the Great Rift Valley, a highly volcanically active region where Africa is splitting into two separate continents. All this volcanism spews ash into the sky, and it then settles over the surrounding desert.

Volcanic ash is highly fertile, and - combined with the carbon dioxide produced by volcanic eruptions - fuels rampant plant growth. Elsewhere, this would result in forest, but there isn’t enough rainfall in East Africa for trees to grow in great density. Grass, however, thrives in drier climates.

So, there is loads of plant matter, and it is nutrient-rich due to the fertile soil. Those two things attract lots of herbivores, in particular, an:

Abundance of mega-herbivores

This is the first reason. Where there is lots of plants and open space, large herbivores almost always evolve. We see this in Africa’s buffalo, America’s bison, South America’s Toxodon, Australia’s Diprotodon, and so on and so forth. Generally, large size means a large mouth to maximize intake of food per mouthful, and a large gut to process the cellulose, as well as the fact that abundant food gives the herbivores more energy to put into giant size, as an anti-predator adaptation too.

The presence of really large grazers provides a potential food source for carnivores. However, carnivores cannot - most of the time - get as much energy as herbivores, since the latter just chomp the ground, while they have to hunt for their own dinners. As a result, carnivores are almost always significantly smaller than local herbivores.

This presents a challenge to any solitary hunter which would hypothetically move into the niche as a predator of local mega-herbivores. Since they cannot evolve a roughly equal size to their prey, it helps to have multiple predators of equal weight.

Presence of other predators

This is another reason for predatory sociality, one that’s thought to be the main cause of pride living in lions. Where there is lots of plants - like the savannah - there will be lots of herbivores, and thus lots of carnivores to feed on them.

In recent prehistory, the African savannah was home to lions, leopards, cheetahs, wild dogs, spotted hyenas, striped hyenas, giant hyenas (Pachycrocuta), saber-toothed cats of various genera, a few species of Xenocyon, and of course various hominids. That’s a lot of predators, and few carnivores would turn down the chance to scavenge another hunter’s kill.

Various African solitary hunters (Mainly cats) have learnt to deal with this in different ways. Leopards started dragging their prey up trees, cheetahs kind of just let themselves get bullied, and lions - we think - evolved sociality. Lions, with their relatively large size, are in fact morphologically adapted primarily for solitary life (With the exception of a few small modifications such as dark ears for communication), and in their solo days they wouldn’t have hesitated to take down relatively large prey.

The larger the prey, the larger the carcass, and therefore the more scavengers that get wind of the free meal. To better defend their large kills, it’s thought that lions became social animals, as cooperation works best for the defense of a single object, especially when attackers could come from any direction.

Respective niches

In large, mammalian carnivores, or at least, terrestrial ones, there seems to be two main “flavours” (Cheetahs are an exception) of hunting style. One, which I will call “cat style”, involves solitary life and ambush predator tactics.

Most big cats are, unsurpisingly, adapted to a “cat style” way of life, and their anatomy reflects this. They have short, truncated snouts to deliver a quick, killing bite, elastic wrists and retractable claws to slash prey, and long hind legs to pounce on victims. Overall, “cat style” is about getting close to the prey and not being seen, and then dispatching it before it can run.

The other set of predation tactics is one I will call “dog style”. This has been adopted by wolves, wild dogs and hyenas, and a less refined version is seen in lions. Typically, species who prefer “dog style” have slightly longer forelegs for running long distances, long snouts for sniffing out prey, powerful but non-lethal bites, and blunt, non-retractile claws for traction on a chase.

The cooperative hunters you have named all use “dog style” in some form or other, though the latter two are more adapted to it. Dog style predators are typically more intelligent than cat style ones, as greater intelligence helps to negotiate social life.

Open space

Like I said earlier, “dog style” predators are typically adapted for running and chasing, rather than ambushing. The African savannah, like all grasslands, is very open, so it’s hard to ambush your prey (You can hide in long grass if you’re the right size, but big predators can’t do that).

If you look at any grassland animal, they usually have adaptations for running. For example, ostriches are great runners. It’s not just by fluke that they evolved their speed and endurance - if you look at other grasslands, you see the emu in Australia and the rhea in South America, which all evolved the same flightless, running body plan independently.

Wildebeest, gazelles, cheetahs, pronghorns and giraffes are also examples of grassland-living runners. The only other successful tactic for grassland herbivores is to get really big, live in organized, discrete herds and fight back (E.g. buffalo, bison, musk ox), which bovines are quite good at.

Usually, cursorial (running) prey triggers the evolution of cursorial predators, which is part of what “dog style” hunters are.

The open space also means that prey will be found in lower density than in a forest, so predators may need to become better at travelling long distances.

So those are all the things about a fertile, plant-filled grassland that make cooperative predators a likely thing to evolve there. Keep in mind that there is one East African pack-hunting predator you didn’t mention in your answer - the genus Homo. We don’t know exactly which ones, but a few of these reasons may be why we are social - and indeed, intelligent - animals today.

Thank you for reading, and I hope I answered the question to your satisfaction.
