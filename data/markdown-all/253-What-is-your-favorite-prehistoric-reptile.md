When I say “giant prehistoric crocodile”, what do you think of? Many would probably say Sarcosuchus. Sarcosuchus imperator was a species of pholidosaur (not quite a crocodilian) which lived in Africa and South America in the Early Cretaceous. It was giant, alright, an estimated 8,000 kilograms and 11–12 metres in length.

Or perhaps Deinosuchus would come to mind. Perhaps up to 5 tonnes in weight and 8–10 metres long, this huge pseudo-alligator lived in river estuaries in what is now the United States, 83–72 million years ago. Contrary to popular belief, it did not co-exist with T. rex, pre-dating Tyrannosaurus by 4 million years.

But I’m not here to talk about them. The stars of this answer will be the super-crocs that too often go unnoticed; believe me, giant crocodilians are a lot more common than you would think.

Lurking on the edge of obscurity, kind of well-known, is Purussaurus. Recent estimates put this giant caiman at 10.9 metres and 5.6 tonnes. It lived during the Miocene in South America, specifically in a huge inland sea - Lake Pebas - brimming with freshwater monsters. Jeremy Wade would have a field day in Pebas.

The true crocodiles have their extinct giants, too. One such species was Crocodylus bugtiensis, an 11 meter beast from the Baluchistan province of Pakistan, in the Oligocene. The largest true crocodile known, it’s quite possible that it fed on Paraceratherium, one of the largest land mammals ever.

Another super-Crocodylus was C. thorbjarnarsoni. A much more recent reptile, it inhabited Kenya in the Plio-Pleistocene and probably hunted our hominin forerunners. It’s not quite as big as some of the others, but at 8 meters it was still gigantic by modern standards.

At over 6 meters, Deltasuchus is probably the smallest on the list, but nevertheless significantly bigger than a typical saltwater crocodile today. Besides, it was probably a dinosaur killer (as it lived 95 million years ago in Texas), which gives it extra points automatically.

There have also been quite a lot of huge gharials and false gharials in prehistory. The largest was definitely Rhamphosuchus, which - being estimated at a maximum of 18 metres - was possibly the largest crocodilian of all time. It lived in India during the Miocene epoch.

Also in the Miocene, but in the aforementioned Lake Pebas, was Gryposuchus, a member of the extinct gryposuchine subfamily of gharials. The largest species, G. croizati, has been estimated at 10 meters in length. It lasted for quite some time in South America, only dying out in the Late Pleistocene.

Fun fact: some gryposuchines survived all the way up to the Late Holocene, such as Ikanogavalias papuensis which finally died out on the Solomon Islands and was the most recent fully marine crocodilian known.

Now, we come to a false gharial, or tomistomine - this one named Toyotamaphimeia (“The best-built crocodilian in the world”). At up to 8 meters long, it lived on the islands of Japan during the Pleistocene. Toyota’s name is derived from the family name Toyoda, so I’m not sure if the two share an etymology.

The last super-gharial I want to talk about is Gavialis pachyrhynchus, which is in the modern gharial genus. According to one 1973 book on herpetology, it likely rivalled the aforementioned Rhamphosuchus in size, which means it could be massive. It lived in India during the Miocene.

In the Jurassic and Cretaceous, there was a suborder of neosuchians known as the thalattosuchians, which were fully marine and had flippers. The largest of them was Machimosaurus, measuring over 7 metres in length. It lived in the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous in Europe.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cf5a35cf1d39e6f1431be72f6b6f3d4b-lq)

Another huge thalattosuchian was Plesiosuchus, just under 7 metres long. While Machimosaurus was in the Teleosauridae family, Plesiosuchus belonged to a better-known one, Metriorhynchidae. Its fossils have been found in Late Jurassic rocks from England and Spain, so it probably co-existed with Machimosaurus.

Jumping forward in time to Lake Pebas again, there’s perhaps history’s weirdest caiman - Mourasuchus. Evidently, it lived a filter-feeding lifestyle like a baleen whale, sifting through the lake’s plankton rather than hunting actively. It was one of the largest-ever crocodilians, too, as it was a whopping 12 metres long.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d4bd392c9873ffed50480713ae101840-lq)

Mourasuchus wasn’t the only filter-feeding crocodile, though. In the Late Cretaceous, there was a family of such creatures known as the stomatosuchids, or pancake crocs. The largest of them was the Egyptian Stomatosuchus, which lived alongside Spinosaurus. It was an estimated 10 meters long.

However, I’d say my favourite prehistoric reptile of all is Barinasuchus. It was a sebecid (an extinct family of South American terrestrial crocs), which lived during the Miocene. It was 6 meters long and weighed a ton, making it - a reptile - the largest-ever land predator in the Cenozoic - the so-called Age of Mammals. Ironic.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f78396d1760d6cd85280ab0aab004eda-lq)

I should also mention its relative, Razanandrongobe. At 7 meters long, it was longer but lighter than Barinasuchus, and lived on Madagascar in the Jurassic. It seems that it was the apex predator of the island (despite living in the prime of the age of dinosaurs), and it had larger teeth than even Tyrannosaurus rex.

So, in short, some of my favourite prehistoric reptiles are the giant crocodiles (and crocodile relatives) which are often neglected in popular culture, with Barinasuchus arveloi being my first choice. Thanks for the A2A!
