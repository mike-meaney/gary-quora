Damn, that’s going to be hard to choose. Among the extinct, non-avian dinosaurs, I’d say it’s between the following three taxa. One, the alvarezsaurids. These were small theropods which evolved 86 million years ago and died out at the end of the Cretaceous.

They are bizarre mainly because of their hands - on each, they had a single “finger” with an enlarged claw. Despite being short, their arms were evidently highly muscular, as was their chest. They had tube-shaped snouts full of needle-like teeth. Alvarezsaurids were possibly myrmecophagous (like anteaters), or perhaps specialized nest-raiders.

Another possible candidate are the scansoriopterygids. These guys inhabited the humid, subtropical forests of China in the second half of the Jurassic Period, sticking around for about 9 million years, as far as we know. There are four known species, the largest of which - Yi qi, meaning “climbing dragon” \- was two feet long.

The scansoriopterygids are famous for the membranes, or patagia, of skin stretched between their fingers. This formed a pair of bat-like wings which allowed the dinosaurs to glide through the forest. They’re probably the closest thing to dragons which the Earth has seen thus far.

Then, of course, we have the iconically weird Deinocheirus, which lived at the very end of the Mesozoic in the Gobi Desert. It was evidently a wading animal which fed on aquatic vegetation, and it was enormous - 12 metres long, and weighing around 7 tonnes.

Its head was long and flattened, like that of a spoonbill, its arms were longer than a man is tall and tipped by massive claws, and on its back it had a huge hump. While it looks like something out of a Dr Seuss book, it was actually in the ornithomimosaur family - related to graceful, ostrich-like animals. You’d never guess.

However, we’ve of course ignored the hugely diverse grouping of dinosaurs which still survives to this day. There are about 10,000 extant species of birds and doubtless hundreds of thousands more which have since gone extinct, so they’d be a good place to look for outliers.

In my opinion, it is in fact hummingbirds which are the weirdest dinosaurs of all. While many of us are used to them and take them for granted, hummingbirds are incredibly bizarre - both on the surface and under it.

Consider the following:

*   They are the smallest of all the dinosaurs. The bee hummingbird of Cuba, for example, can weigh as little as 1.6 grams. That’s ten times smaller than the smallest known non-avian dinosaur!
*   They have the fastest metabolisms of any animal, period. In a single day, a hummingbird may consume up to 3 times its body weight in food, feeding every 10–15 minutes and visiting some 2,000 flowers.
*   Unlike any other vertebrate, their amazing metabolisms can use fructose as well as glucose for fuel, and converts sugar directly into energy instead of breaking it down.
*   They have the highest brain-to-body weight ratio of any dinosaur. A hummingbird’s brain constitutes about 4.5% of its total body mass, compared to only 2% for Homo sapiens.
*   Their skills in aviation are unparalleled, at least among vertebrates. They can hover, fly backwards, and to the side, beating their wings a staggering 80 times per second in the process. Their heart rate can reach up to 1,260 BPM.

And then you have the hummingbird species which are weird even for hummingbirds…

I don’t know about you, but to me these birds are a clear winner.
