It's not exactly a predator-prey relationship both ways, but the relationship between lions and Cape buffaloes is quite similar to what you're asking about.

As you may well know, lion prides prey on Cape buffaloes, and they even form a large part of the diet in some regions, particularly in dry or brutal environments.

It's not hard to believe that one of the primary causes of death for lions (aside from humans) is injuries inflicted on them by Cape buffaloes - what with their massive size and sharp horns.

However, what most people don't know is that Cape buffaloes actually search out lions, both cubs and adults, and take them on, with the express purpose of killing them unprovoked.

(I can't guarantee that this photo is an example of this behavior and not just a buffalo defending itself)

Obviously, the buffaloes don't prey on lions per se, but it at least is an instance where both species actively hunt down and attack each other. Cape buffaloes have, chillingly, also stalked injured humans in the wild.
