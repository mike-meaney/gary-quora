## Would a living Hesperocyonid be recognisable at first glance as a canid?

If I was a zoologist (Which I am) and I saw this guy running around, I’d probably place it either in the family Eupleridae, or in a sister clade to that group.

The Euplerids are a clade of Feliformian carnivorans endemic to the island of Madagascar, currently comprising of seven genera and ten species. The most well-known member of the family is the fossa, Cryptoprocta ferox:

The superficial similarity is striking, actually, with the extant species looking every bit the bulky Hesperocyon.

A quick search hasn’t yielded any images of a Euplerid skeleton, so here’s one of a Herpestid, their closest relative, compared to a Hesperocyonid skeleton:

To the simpleton, most carnivore skeletons look very similar, but there are notable differences. The reconstruction above is much more canid-like, but still quite strange-looking.

In short; assuming a fleeting sighting of a living animal, I would say it looks quite like a Euplerid.
