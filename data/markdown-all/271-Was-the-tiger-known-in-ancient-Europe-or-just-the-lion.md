In ancient times, there were definitely Europeans which knew about tigers. First of all, there was the Caspian tiger, a now-extinct tiger population. Up until 1922, there were Caspian tigers in the Asian part of Georgia, mere kilometres away from what’s typically considered as being part of Europe.

Additionally, Europeans have been trading with Asian regions such as India for thousands of years. The Romans, for example, frequently sailed to India via the Red Sea, and actually brought tigers back to the Empire for use in gladiator fights.

In Villa Romana de Casale - an ancient Roman villa in Sicily - there are countless mosaics depicting exotic animals from Africa and Asia, tigers among them. Here’s a captive tigress in its most famous mosaic, nicknamed “The Great Hunt”.

So, to answer your question, people in ancient Europe certainly knew what tigers were, and many of them would have seen them in the flesh.
