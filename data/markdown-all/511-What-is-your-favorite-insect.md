There are many great candidates, but rove beetles would definitely be up there at the moment. Let’s take a look at how badass these things are.

First of all, they have the ability to shoot their proboscises out to distances of up to half their body length, just like a chameleon would with its tongue. I can’t find any online source detailing the mechanism of this, but I recall reading that they inflate the proboscis with air to push it out at high speed.

The incredible tongue-like organs have adhesive secretions on the end, which grab the rove beetles’ favourite prey - springtails, six-legged close relatives of insects.

Secondly, they just look really cool when they take off. If you look closely at a rove beetle walking, you’ll notice that its elytra (wing covers) are very small. Yet, when in flight, its wings appear normally sized - so how do they fit under the elytra.

The answer is that they’re folded up when not in use, like origami. As the beetle takes off, they unfurl, and it looks pretty amazing. Here’s a video which shows you how it works: [Take off and wing folding motion in a rove beetle](http://youtube.com/watch/v=HhU9NhHIYQc "youtube.com").

Lastly, rove beetles of the genus Stenus are able to synthesize a compound called stenusin, which is highly hydrophobic. While they’re on the surface of water, they can squirt the stenusin out of their abdomens, propelling them away at high speed.

The boost increases their speed on the water from 3–5 centimetres per second to 45–70. This method of locomotion is called Marangoni propulsion, and you can demonstrate it in your kitchen sink with a toothpick and some washing-up liquid.

So, there’s an animal with a chameleon tongue, origami wings and a jet-propelled anus. I think we can all agree that rove beetles are pretty damn amazing critters.
