Pneumodesmus newmani

This prehistoric millipede is the earliest known animal to live on land. It was once thought to have lived in the Silurian period, about 428 million years ago, while all other life was living in the sea.

Last year, a study by Stephanie Suarez showed that the original dating was wrong, and she found it to live in the Early Devonian, but its exact age remains a mystery.

However, no air-breathing land animals have been discovered from that time, so it is still the earliest known terrestrial animal.

This is a Pneumodesmus fossil:

The animal is tiny, only about 1 centimetre long. Its exterior was found to contain organs resembling spiracles (Holes that lead to a respiratory system), which is how paleontologists found out that it breathed air.

Interestingly, its fossil was found by Mike Newman… a bus driver.

Well, that’s all I know about the first terrestrial animal. The first land vertebrates didn’t appear for about 50 million years after Pneumodesmus, in the form of animals like Icthyostega.
