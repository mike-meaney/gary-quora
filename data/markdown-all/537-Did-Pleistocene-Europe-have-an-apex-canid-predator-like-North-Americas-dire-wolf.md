You’re looking for the megafaunal wolf, an ecomorph of the gray wolf which was adapted to hunt and scavenge the Pleistocene megafauna.

> We know also that there were distinct wolf populations existing ten of thousands of years ago. One such wolf, which we call the megafaunal wolf, preyed on large game such as horses, bison and perhaps very young mammoths.

I can’t find any reconstructions, probably because it’s basically just a normal wolf superficially, so here’s a megafaunal wolf skull. The palate is broad and short and the carnassials large, perfect for delivering heightened bite force. Just like the dire wolf, it was apparently specialized for killing very large prey.

Isotopic analysis of megafaunal wolves’ bone collagen suggests that they ate horses, bison, muskox and even mammoth. Compared with modern gray wolves, this species was a hypercarnivore. Its extinction was almost certainly caused by the disappearance of the Pleistocene megafauna in Europe.
