Technically, yes.

There have been humans in Australia for at least 49,000 years. On the mainland, you have the Aboriginal Australians, and also the distinct Torres Strait Islanders on the Torres Strait Islands.

These indigenous people have been here long enough to deserve the right to be called a native population, in both the anthropological and biogeographical sense. They - before European contact - hunted and foraged in the wild and formed part of the ecosystem.

Sure, they may have wiped out a lot of megafauna, but that is still a natural phenomenon. Species outcompete other species, and prey organisms sometimes face predation pressure which they cannot withstand.
