## Why did some animals like sharks, crocodiles, dragonflies, spiders, jellyfish, and cockroaches still look the same for millions of years, but not mammals?

You sure about that? This is Juramaia sinensis, which lived 160 million years ago:

And this is a modern tree shrew:

While some mammal lineages have indeed changed a lot since those Jurassic days, others have stayed much the same. That, too, is true for a lot of the “living fossil” groups you cited in your question.

Compare the 360 million year-old shark Cladoselache:

To, say, a basking shark:

Or early Triassic relatives of crocodiles, such as this aetosaur:

To any crocodilian from modern times:

While there are plenty of animals which do look remarkably similar to their ancient counterparts, there are virtually always related animals - descending from the same ancestors - which look very different. While some groups diversify and adapt to new niches, others find themselves in an ecologically stable position and needn’t change much over the eons.
