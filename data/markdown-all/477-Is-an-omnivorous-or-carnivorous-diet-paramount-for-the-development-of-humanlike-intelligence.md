## Is an omnivorous or carnivorous diet paramount for the development of humanlike intelligence?

Helpful yes, but paramount, I doubt. Just look at elephants, who are obligate herbivores. Their intelligence is well-documented, and I'd even go so far as to say that the main difference between them and us is our capacity for language.

Consider the following facts:

*   Their brains, which are five kilograms in weight, have more cortical gyres than any primate or cetacean. Their brain-to-body mass ratio is up there with great apes and dolphins.
*   They have highly complex social systems based around the knowledge and experience of a single leader, the matriarch.
*   They are more than capable of differentiating between herds - in fact, a matriarch will instantly recognize a rival from another herd and react accordingly. They can even differentiate between different human cultures.
*   They are one of the only animals which have funeral rites. They bury their dead and the dead of other animals with fruit, flowers and leaves (grave goods?)
*   They even display some parallels with human religion, ritualistically waving branches at the waxing moon and bathing when it's full.
*   They use tools all the time, making fly swatters out of sticks, covering over pools of water to prevent evaporation, and dropping logs on electric fences to disable them.
*   Pregnant elephants have been seen chewing special leaves which local humans use to induce labor and miscarriage.
*   They can recognize themselves in the mirror - I get that this is an imperfect test for consciousness, but it is at least an indicator of high intelligence.
*   They seem to have artistic inclinations, as many zoo elephants paint actual pictures and images.

And all this without a shred of meat, or even decently nutritious plants for that matter. I'm not suggesting that elephants are as intelligent as humans, but they're - in the grand scheme of things - pretty bloody close. I can foresee no barrier between their intelligence and ours which herbivores could not cross.
