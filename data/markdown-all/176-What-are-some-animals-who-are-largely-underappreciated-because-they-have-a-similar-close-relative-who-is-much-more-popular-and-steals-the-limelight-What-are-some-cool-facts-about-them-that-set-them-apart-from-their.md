## What are some animals who are largely underappreciated because they have a similar close relative who is much more popular, and steals the limelight? What are some cool facts about them that set them apart from their more famous relative?

I love this question, so thanks for asking it! Here are my top picks.

*   Everyone knows the puma, but its closest relative is much less talked about. The jaguarundi is a reclusive cat found from Arizona to Argentina. Unusually for a feline, it is mainly active during the day, and has a uniform colouration instead of markings. Its build is actually quite similar to that of a mustelid, hence the nickname “otter-cat”.

*   Monitor lizards are popular, and for good reason, they’re fascinating. But have you heard of the earless monitor lizard? A cousin to the varanids, it has its own taxonomic family, and inhabits Southeast Asia. It’s semiaquatic, but can climb trees with its prehensile tail. It’s also the only lizard to shed its skin in one piece, rather than it flaking off gradually, and it’s venomous.

*   Of the various crocodile species, the Cuban crocodile is probably the most unique, but one of the least-known. Endemic to Cuba, it evolved not as an aquatic fish-eater but as a predator of Pleistocene megafauna like ground sloths. It has long legs built for running, sometimes hunts in packs, and is much more aggressive than other crocodilians.

*   I’m sure many have heard of the American harpy eagle, arguably the world’s largest eagle. However, you probably don’t know the Papuan harpy eagle, its close cousin in New Guinea of all places. It’s the apex predator on the island, preying on animals as large as tree kangaroos and cassowaries. If that wasn’t cool enough, it can reach high running speeds on the ground, which is quite unique for an eagle.

*   On the topic of New Guinean wildlife, I must mention the New Guinea singing dog, the forgotten relative of the dingo. A wild population descended from feral dogs, this mysterious canine gets its name from its vocalizations. They howl together, using a very unique, pulsing trill, almost like the vibrato effect in music. They often compete with the eagles over kills.

*   Another underappreciated dog is the bush dog. The closest living relative of the well-known maned wolf, it’s almost like the inverse of its cousin. Whereas the maned wolf is absurdly lanky, the bush dog is comically stubby. Found in the Amazon, it’s a specialist rodent-hunter, working in packs, and it has webbed feet for swimming.

*   Speaking of creatures from the Amazon (I am nailing these transitions), let’s talk about the tamandua knifefish. The electric eel is the most famous knifefish - yup, it’s not an eel. Tamandua knifefish dwell only in deep rivers so murky that they are practically pitch black. Due to this, they have no skin pigment or vision, using electromagnetic fields to navigate. They suck up invertebrates with their anteater-like snout.

*   Another taxon which definitely deserves a mention is the pygmy sperm whale. Together with the similar dwarf sperm whale, it forms the family Kogiidae, closely related to true sperm whales. They’ve got the blocky head of a sperm whale, but are only a few metres long at most. Little is known about them, as they’re almost never seen alive.

*   You might know of antlions; their carnivorous larvae bury themselves in the sand and lie in wait, Sarlacc-style. Their closest relatives, owlflies, are just as cool. Their larvae are also ambush predators, but incorporate sand and debris into their exoskeleton to blend in with their environment. Their jaws are huge, even wider than the body itself.

*   Now, another mammalian carnivore. The tayra is the lesser-known, slimmer cousin of the notorious wolverine of the Holarctic. Found across much of South-Central America, they’re very agile, being capable of leaping between trees and “galloping” along branches at high speed. Uniquely, they store plantains in caches to allow them to ripen for later.

*   This last one is probably the least obscure on the list, but it still deserves more recognition. The takin is the closest living relative of the Arctic muskox, found mainly in the Eastern Himalayas and Sichuan, China. Its stunning coat may have inspired the Golden Fleece of Greek mythology, and is coated head-to-toe in an oily secretion used for scent-marking.

So, those are the best examples I can think of. For the most part, the main reason these animals are so little-known is because they’re much more rare than their relatives. Many of them are endangered; the Cuban crocodile in particular is on the brink of extinction.

Thanks everyone for reading, I hope you learned some new things about these wonderful animals.

Edit: The picture for the pygmy sperm whale actually shows a baby pygmy sperm whale. The adults are about 3 metres long. Thanks [Victor Grubsky](https://www.quora.com/profile/Victor-Grubsky "www.quora.com") for pointing out the momma whale in the foreground.
