## Why do so many mammals have a different texture of skin on their noses, but not humans?

So, you’re referring to a structure called the rhinarium, which most mammals have. This furless patch of skin which surrounds the nostrils is usually covered in crenellations, or wrinkles, which probably serve to increase the surface area of the rhinarium’s olfactory equipment.

Humans, of course, don’t have a rhinarium.

Nor do other apes,

Monkeys,

Or tarsiers.

Our closest relatives which do have rhinaria are the strepsirrhine primates - lemurs, bushbabies and the like. For this reason, they are often known as “wet-nosed primates”. The above animals, including humans, are all dry-nosed primates, or haplorhines.

So, something clearly happened to the primate nose when the order split into two groups, with one retaining the rhinarium, the other losing it. It seems that us dry-nosed primates gradually became more dependent on vision, over millions of years.

As sight became a more important sense, there was no longer a need for such a sophisticated nose. While the human sense of smell isn’t as inferior as we once thought, there’s no doubt that - in general - our olfactory abilities are significantly less acute than most animals with rhinaria.
