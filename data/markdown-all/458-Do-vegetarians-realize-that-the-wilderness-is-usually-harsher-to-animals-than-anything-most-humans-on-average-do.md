## Do vegetarians realize that the wilderness is usually harsher to animals than anything most humans on average do?

Nature is absolutely, irrefutably harsher than what “most humans on average do”. However, something tells me that it’s not what most average Joes do to animals that makes ethical vegetarians go off meat.

This is where things get complicated. The more extreme or complex things are, the harder they are to compare. And it so happens that both wild nature and the nastier commercial farms are both extremely brutal. This is nature:

I would strongly disagree with anyone who says that nature is humane. The kills you see in virtually any documentary are heavily censored; real prey deaths are often infinitely painful. If nature is humane, then shooting animals is utterly saintly.

However, I do agree that - at least from what I’ve seen - commercial farming can be extremely brutal too. That said, I’m skeptical that this is the norm, having heard several people with experience in slaughterhouses who say otherwise.
