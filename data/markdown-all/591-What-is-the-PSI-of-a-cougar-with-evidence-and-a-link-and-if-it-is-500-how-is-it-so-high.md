## What is the PSI of a cougar (with evidence and a link) and if it is 500+, how is it so high?

This article - [The strongest bites in the animal kingdom (20 Photos)](https://thechive.com/2016/06/16/the-strongest-bites-in-the-animal-kingdom-20-photos/ "thechive.com") - says 350 PSI, but cites no sources and appears to be written by a layperson. I found this book - [Snow Leopards](https://books.google.no/books?id=nAvSBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=bite%20force%20%22puma%22&source=bl&ots=uAQyTWRQjG&sig=ACfU3U0E0ZUTgyofsfVdRNNWJGA-KDgplA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi4tdnN38_iAhUPSxUIHelfCJ4Q6AEwFXoECF4QAQ#v%3Donepage%26q%3Dbite%20force%20%22puma%22%26f%3Dfalse "books.google.no") - and it has a table with bite force estimations for various felids.

The table gives 499.6 newtons for the puma. However, you asked for pounds per square inch, not newtons. 499.6 newtons is 112.31455 pounds, but it would be very difficult for me to convert that to PSI without dissecting a puma’s head. As it happens, I currently lack puma heads.

To make matters more complicated, I found this other assessment - [https://www.unbc.ca/sites/default/files/events/11604/unbcs-1st-physi-o-lymics-2014/6renatagebertbiteforceposter.pdf](https://www.unbc.ca/sites/default/files/events/11604/unbcs-1st-physi-o-lymics-2014/6renatagebertbiteforceposter.pdf "www.unbc.ca") - which gives a completely different bite force estimate for the puma, 1270 newtons. What’s more… it cites the same source as the Snow Leopards book.

I checked that source - [BITE FORCES AND EVOLUTIONARY ADAPTATIONS TO FEEDING ECOLOGY IN CARNIVORES](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[347:BFAEAT]2.0.CO;2 "esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com") - and it actually said that the bite force (at the canine tip) was 971 newtons, which is close enough to the first one, but still different to both “citations”. Weird.

Alas, still no PSI. I found one more source - [(PDF) Bite club: Comparative bite force in big biting mammals and the prediction of predatory behaviour in fossil taxa](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7920119_Bite_club_Comparative_bite_force_in_big_biting_mammals_and_the_prediction_of_predatory_behaviour_in_fossil_taxa "www.researchgate.net") - but it measures bite force in Bite Force Quotient (BFQ), which cannot be converted to pounds per square inch.

In short, the best answer I can give you is 971 newtons, with a Bite Force Quotient of 108\. Sorry to disappoint, but it seems no such research yet exists.
