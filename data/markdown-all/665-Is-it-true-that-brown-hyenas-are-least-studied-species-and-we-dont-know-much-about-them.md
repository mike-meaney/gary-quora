## Is it true that brown hyenas are least studied species and we don't know much about them?

Brown hyenas have certainly been studied more than, say, various species of anaerobic Loriciferan, so they’re not technically the “least studied species”.

However, what they are, and what I suspect you are asking about, is the least studied species of Hyaenid. There are only a handful of papers solely about brown hyenas, and only one organization is dedicated to studying them ([The Brown Hyena Research Project](http://www.strandwolf.org/index.php/home.html "www.strandwolf.org"))
