Unfortunately, some safari guides do little to avoid disturbing the wildlife. This is a cheetah I photographed on my last safari:

Over 50 safari vehicles were wheeling around it, sometimes at a distance of less than a foot, and it was visibly confused and afraid. It picked up pace and retreated to a bushy hill, which was subsequently ringed by the dozens of jeeps, effectively trapping the animal.

One the other hand, this is somewhat understandable from the guides’ point of view. They are, to a certain degree, subservient to their customers and must strive to give them the best experience possible. Guiding doesn’t pay very well, after all.

So, it’s more down to you respecting the animals, not the guides. In this instance, I took a few pictures and asked to move on, to give the cheetah one less vehicle to worry about.
