Currently, there are sixteen species of crocodile on the planet, on four different continents and falling into some three taxonomic genera. More than half of the world’s living crocodylians are crocodiles, with the rest being alligators, caimans, gharials and tomistomas.

The largest and most wide-ranging genus of crocodiles is Crocodylus, which contains as follows:

*   The Nile crocodile, C. niloticus. The second-largest croc on average, it’s found over much of Africa, including Madagascar. While, on average, not as big as the saltwater species, they do hunt much larger prey than any other reptile, having been observed killing fully grown buffaloes, giraffes and manatees, all of which weigh hundreds of kilograms.

*   The saltwater crocodile, C. porosus, which you’ll find in Southeast Asia, the northern reaches of Australia, the eastern coast of India, and the sea in between. It can venture for hundreds of kilometres through the ocean by “surfing” currents, and - on average - is the largest reptile, reaching up to 1,075 kg in some cases.

*   The Orinoco crocodile, C. intermedius, which inhabits the Orinoco Basin of northern South America. It could be considered the world’s largest reptile, going by maximum size - the largest individual recorded weighed about 1.1 tonnes and measured nearly 6.8 metres in length. They mainly eat large fish, but will sometimes feed on caimans or even other Orinoco crocodiles.

*   The freshwater crocodile, C. johnstoni. Endemic to northern Australia, it’s the much smaller cousin of the saltie, measuring 2–4 metres in length. Humorously, it was meant to be named after a naturalist called Arthur Jonstone, but due to a spelling error it was referred to as C. johnsoni for decades. Most of the literature has since been updated, thankfully.

*   The mugger crocodile, C. palustris, of the Indian subcontinent. Usually measuring between 2 and 3.5 metres, the largest may attain 5.6 metre lengths. They have the broadest, most robust snout of the crocodiles. Additionally, they were once the highest-living crocodilians, previously being found in the Bhutanese Himalayas.

*   The American crocodile, C. acutus. It lives in northwestern South America, all of Central America, western Mexico, the Caribbean and the southern tip of Florida, where it coexists with the American alligator. They thrive in salty waters like C. porosus, including hypersaline lakes. The only crocodiles in the US, they measure up to 5 metres in length.

*   The Philippine crocodile, C. mindorensis. As its name suggests, it’s only found in the Philippines, and is sadly critically endangered. It eats fish, and the embryos in its eggs are sometimes eaten by fire ants. The ancient Tagalog people believed that it ferries the dead to their equivalent of Heaven and Hell, and that killing one is punishable by death.

*   The Cuban crocodile, C. rhombifer, which is found in a single swamp on an island off Cuba. It’s fairly small (~2 metres), but extremely aggressive, and sometimes hunts in packs. This, in addition to its highly terrestrial habits, indicate that it is adapted to hunting now-extinct Cuban ground sloths. Cuban crocs are easily recognized, due to their scales’ spotty pattern.

*   The West African crocodile, C. suchus. It was long considered a subspecies of Nile crocodile, until it was proven to be distinct in 2003. It is smaller and much less aggressive than C. niloticus, and lives in West/Central Africa. Some even live in Saharan oases, and this was actually the species which the Ancient Egyptians knew and worshipped.

*   Southeast Asia’s Siamese crocodile, C. siamensis. In the wild, it’s easily one of the most endangered crocodylians in the world, having disappeared from 99% of its range. However, curiously, there are a staggering 700,000 in crocodile farms throughout the region, so - if it does go extinct in the wild - there are plenty we could use to revive the species.

*   The New Guinea crocodile, C. novaeguineae, which lives only in the interior of northern New Guinea. As crocodiles go, it’s very aquatic, rarely coming out of the water, and measures up to 3.5 metres in length. In 2018, there was a heartbreaking incident where West Papuan locals slaughtered nearly 300 of these crocodiles, as revenge for a previous attack which killed one man.

*   Hall’s New Guinea crocodile, C. halli, which was discovered as a distinct species in September of 2019 - both a few months ago and last decade. It’s very similar to the New Guinea crocodile, but differs slightly in certain skeletal features, and lives in the southern part of the island. The two species likely split due to the uplift of the New Guinea Highlands.

*   Morelet’s crocodile, C. moreletii. Like the American and Cuban crocodiles, it’s found in the New World - specifically, in the eastern regions of Mexico, Belize and Guatemala. It’s not very big, averaging 2.1 metres in length, and has a rather broad snout. It’s recently been introduced to the Rio Grande in Mexico, which means it could possibly migrate up to the USA in time.

All in all, there are thirteen species in the genus Crocodylus, ranging from as far west as the Pacific coast of Mexico to as far as east as Micronesia. There are two further genera in the crocodile subfamily, one is Ostaeolaemus, which contains one species - O. tetraspis, the dwarf crocodile.

Dwarf crocodiles are the smallest crocodiles, and - going by minimum size - the smallest crocodylians overall. On average they’re about 1.5 metres long, and are heavily armoured even for crocodiles. One of two subspecies, O. t. tetraspis, lives in West Africa, while the other one \- O. t. osborni \- is found in the Congo Basin and is smaller.

There is also a third genetically distinct population, in Gabon, which is the most fascinating of all. These crocodiles live only in caves, where they feed on insects like crickets and bat guano. They are larger than their surface-dwelling cousins, and - due to the alkaline guano eroding their scales - appear orange in colour.

Lastly, the third genus of crocodiles is known as Mecistops, which means “longest face” in Greek. It contains two species - the West African slender-snouted crocodile and Central African slender-snouted crocodile, which are separated by a chain of volcanoes in Cameroon.

The slender-snouted crocodiles were long considered to be part of the Crocodylus genus, but genetic studies have confirmed they are equally closely related to Crocodylus and Ostaeolaemus \- thus, they form a genus in itself.

Where they’re found is pretty self-explanatory, and they are 2–4 metres long. Their namesake characteristic is an elongated, gharial-like snout.

So, that’s most of what you need to know about all sixteen species of crocodile. Happy New Year’s Day, everyone, and welcome to the 2020’s.
