Quite a few, actually! In various regions of Australia, seven new beautiful species of peacock spider, in the genus Maratus, have been discovered.

As well as a new species of parasitic fungus which was actually “discovered” on Twitter. Someone tweeted a picture of a millipede and a biologist noticed some strange dots on its exoskeleton, which turned out to be a new type of fungus.

Just today, it was announced that five new species of frog in the genus Leptobrachella have been discovered in China’s Yunnan Province.

Also, in the forests of Sri Lanka, a new type of orchid has been found. It seems as though it’s in critical danger of extinction.

Other discoveries in early May include several types of freshwater fish, known as filament barbs, in the Western Ghats.

And a species of the parasite worm Trichinella, a genus responsible for the disease trichinosis, which lives in wolverines. Due to the boreal nature of its hosts’ habitat, this species is highly tolerant of cold temperatures, and therefore freezing it won’t kill it, as is usually used on other Trichinella species.

Further back, in late April, genetic analyses revealed that the Mata mata turtle of South America was in fact two, species, not one.

In the Alps, several new species of moths were discovered, all of them being named after famous mountain climbers.

A new blenny was discovered in the Pacific, found in the coastal waters off a handful of archipelagos such as the Pitcairn Islands, and the Line Islands of Kiribati.

And in India, a new species of pit viper has been fittingly titled Triremurus salazar, after a certain Salazar Slytherin.

On the same day as that snake, four species of leaf-nosed bat were discovered in Africa. Leaf-nosed bats are actually fairly closely related to horseshoe bats, likely the origin of a kind of virus known as COVID-19. You may have heard of it.

And those are just the extant species. On the 29th of April, a Late Cretaceous lizard was found in South America, called Neokotus. It’s the oldest squamate known from the Southern Hemisphere by 20 million years.

Also on the 29th, a new genus of gondwanathere (a group of Mesozoic mammals) was discovered from Late Cretaceous Madagascar, which is probably the best preserved mammal fossil from the whole Mesozoic era. It was also one of the largest.

Really, it’s amazing that species are being discovered at such a rate, especially in a time when you think field activities might ground to a standstill in many places.
