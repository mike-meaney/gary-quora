First of all, “pterodactyl” is an incorrect term. What does it refer to? Pterodactylus? Pterodactylidae? Pterydactyloidea? Pterosaurs? Beats me. I assume you mean pterosaurs, though, as that’s how it’s usually used.

Secondly, pterosaurs aren’t dinosaurs. Dinosaurs and pterosaurs are related, to a degree - they’re both in the clade Ornithodira. However, they’re each on a different branch of that clade and about as closely related as humans and dogs.

To answer your question, there were absolutely flying dinosaurs - the birds, of which there were perhaps a million species over the course of their evolutionary history.

There also some non-bird\* dinosaurs which may have flew, although this is often controversial. They are:

*   Microraptor, a four-winged creature thought by some to be a glider. Recent studies have suggested it was capable of powered flight.

*   Rahonavis, maintained by Luis Chiappe to have been able to fly. It might have been a glider or just completely grounded.

There’s also a hypothesis that various dinosaurs which were definitely flightless; oviraptorosaurs and Zhenyuanlong hui, for example, had flighted ancestors due to evidence from feathers used in flying. Some even go so far as to say that dromaeosaurs, therizinosaurs, alvarezsaurs and even ornithomimosaurs were all once flyers.

\*I use bird here to refer to the clade Avialae, not just Aves.
