Surprisingly, there is, or rather was, such thing as a giant heron. The Bennu heron, Ardea bennuides, was a spectacular bird over two metres tall. It lived in the Arabian Peninsula until as recently as 2,000 BC, and is thought to have inspired the phoenix-like Bennu of Egyptian mythology.

It’s true that modern herons can be formidable fighters, and this giant heron would have likely been even more of one. Their harpoon-like bills and sinuous necks - the same adaptations which make them so good at catching fish - are effective weapons, and can be used to successfully ward off kleptoparasites as big as African fish eagles.

Nevertheless, while these features allow herons to defend themselves against the likes of other birds, they would be no match for a machairodont cat. “Giant” as the Bennu heron was, birds are naturally lightweight creatures, and the largest sabertooths could potentially outweigh it by fifty times.

The main advantage a giant heron would have against a saber-toothed cat would be flight. However, if it was actually going to fight, it’d have to stay low, at which point a single swipe of the paw from the cat could fatally injure it.

Thus, it seems like in most scenarios, the saber-toothed cat would have a meal of poultry. This is probably true even for the smaller species of machairodont, because even the smallest genus - Adelphailurus - weighed in at 50 kg, likely making it at least 5 times the size of the Bennu heron.
