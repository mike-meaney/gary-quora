## Do scientists â€” more specifically, biologists â€” claim with absolute certainty that biological evolution is true?

It depends.

That DNA mutates and the frequency of alleles can change in a population has been directly observed, and is thus true.

Natural selection is a product of logic and is therefore true.

That new species can arise has been observed, and again, is true.

The age of fossils can be proven by looking at the radioactive decay of uranium, and has in that way seen to be true.

If new species can arise, and the earliest microfossils are as old as they are, then life must have been evolving all that time.

That all life descends from a common ancestor is not “proven” per se, put there is an enormous amount of evidence for it.

Whether or not life can be “breathed into”, as Darwin put it, non-living matter is not the domain of evolution, though we do have a rough idea of what might have happened.
