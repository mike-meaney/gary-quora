Assuming you count vultures as birds of “prey”, it’s the cinereous vulture, Aegypius monachus. The largest member of the order Accipitriformes, this gigantic bird weighs about 14 kilograms and has a 3.1 meter wingspan, meaning it’s about twice the size of a large golden eagle. It’s found in southern Europe and much of Asia.

In second place we have the Eurasian griffon, Gyps fulvus. Weighing from 6.5 to 11 kilograms, they still easily outsize any wild eagles. This one has a patchy distribution across much of the Old World, including Southern Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and South and Central Asia.

After the griffon, it’s my favourite species of vulture, the bearded vulture, also known as the bone vulture or lammergeier. They’re so interesting that they probably merit an answer to themselves, so I won’t go into details here. They weigh up to 7.8 kilograms and are found in Southern Europe, East Africa, and regions of Asia.

Finally we come to our first non-vulture, the white-tailed sea eagle. This is the largest raptor in Europe, with females weighing in at 4–6.9 kilograms, and the fourth-largest raptor in the world (after Philippine, Steller’s sea and harpy eagles). It mainly eats fish and birds, occasionally hunting mammals.

In fifth place, we have the incredibly powerful golden eagle. At a maximum of 6.7 kilograms, they’re barely smaller than a white-tailed sea eagle, but definitely more badass. Golden eagles have been recorded to kill 50 kg reindeer, 70 kg sika deer, and even a 114 kg domestic calf.

I’ll mention the sixth, too, as it is the first non-accipitrid to appear on the list. This is the Eurasian eagle owl, which - being up to 4 kilograms in weight - is the largest owl in the world. It might seem unimpressive compared to the eagles and vultures, but 4 kilos is still no joke for a flying bird.

There a few more eagle species which are close behind (~3.5 kgs), but this seems like a good place to conclude. It’s worth noting that in the Pleistocene, all these birds would be outsized by the Spanish vulture Aegypius prepyraenicus. Its exact size isn’t known, but it was definitely bigger than the cinereous vulture.
