Lambay Island is a small, roughly 2.5 square kilometre island off the east coast of Ireland, and in 1904, it was purchased by a man called Cecil Baring. Baring was fascinated by natural history and ecology, and attempted to seed the island with all kinds of creatures.

Among the species he introduced were peacocks, mouflon sheep (a species ancestral to the domestic sheep), kinkajous (primate-like relatives of raccoons) and even rheas (pictured), which are huge South American ratites.

Unfortunately, none fared so well in the long term, as the animals weren’t cut out for life in a temperate maritime climate, especially on such a small island. Eventually, Cecil Baring died, and ownership of the island was passed onto his son, Rupert Baring.

Rupert tried to introduce a different species to Lambay Island, one which would prove to thrive there. In the 1950s, he brought over several red-necked wallabies. Why marsupials native to dry Australian scrublands did better in Ireland than wild sheep, I don’t know, but they definitely did.

Over the following decades, the joeys grew up, reproduced, and the population increased. These first wallabies were not let roam free, however, and were cared for in captive conditions. That all changed in the 1980s.

At this time, Dublin Zoo was coincidentally struggling with a population boom of red-necked wallabies. Fota Wildlife Park, in the southwest of the country, took some in, but ultimately the zoo sent seven of the marsupials to Baring and his island.

Rupert couldn’t maintain so many animals himself, and the island was isolated from the rest of Ireland’s ecology should a population explosion occur, so it was decided to let the newcomers breed with the resident wallabies and set them all free.

They proliferated, and what was once a handful has become a thriving population of over 100 individuals. Rupert has of course since passed away (though his granddaughter Millie Baring is alive), and tourists can visit the island on tours.

Allegedly, the wallabies are a common sight for visitors, as you’d expect with so many in so small a location. While they are technically classed as an invasive species, their impact on the local ecosystem seems to be negligible, and their population is under control.
