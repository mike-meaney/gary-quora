## Are there any extant flightless warblers or other species of small songbirds unable to fly?

So, the biggest, most diverse group of birds is the perching birds, or passerines. In fact, nearly two thirds of all birds are passerines - they include wrens, robins, sparrows, finches… most of the feathered friends we see from day to day.

The perching birds can be divided into two subgroups - the songbirds and the suboscines. Today, there are sadly no flightless songbirds. However, there are “functionally flightless” species among their close relatives the suboscines. I’m talking about tapaculos.

Specifically, tapaculos in the genus Scytalopus. They are found in basically the entirety of South and Central America, except for the Amazon region, but despite their wide range of habitats, they are notoriously difficult to tell apart from one another.

Almost all Scytalopus tapaculos are chubby, rotund birds with uniform greyish-black plumage and a short, perky tail. Even for ornithologists, they’re largely impossible to identify without hearing their song. Because these birds are so indistinguishable, new species are discovered all the time - three were found in Peru last year:

Anyway, tapaculos in this genus spend virtually all their time on the forest floor, very occasionally making short bursts of flight. Because of this, they are considered “functionally flightless” - while they are technically capable of some semblance of powered flying, they don’t engage in it in the wild.

It’s no wonder why they struggle to take to the air. Their bodies are heavy and plump, their wings disproportionately short, their breastbone is severely atrophied, and they don’t even have fused collarbones. This is pretty significant, as fusion of the clavicles is one of birds’ fundamental traits.

So, I think Scytalopus are the closest living birds to what you’re looking for, as they are the only near-flightless passerines. It’s not a mystery why not many people know about tapaculos - they are frustratingly cryptic and reclusive in the wild - but still, it’s a shame that these tubby little birds don’t get more love.

I should definitely add that there have been flightless songbirds in the recent past, but they are extinct now. New Zealand had four species of large, flightless wrens, the last of which disappeared in 1985. The Canaries never had a flightless canary, but they did have the flightless long-legged bunting.

Also, I couldn’t make myself publish this answer without giving a shoutout to the adorable Inaccessible Island rail.

It is found only on the barren and aptly named Inaccessible Island, a remote volcanic rock in the South Atlantic’s Tristan de Cunha, the world’s most isolated inhabited group of islands. Being slightly larger than the aforementioned tapaculos, it is the smallest fully flightless bird on Earth.

Inaccessible Island rails weigh as little as 13 grams fully grown, and have a placid manner due to their very slow metabolism. You’d think they would have long since gone extinct, being tiny, flightless and sluggish, but there is a near absence of natural predators on their island, so they survive.

In this aspect they remind me of the bird equivalent of sloths, or perhaps miniature dodos of the Atlantic. Because they fall prey to other animals so rarely, the rails are absolutely ubiquitous on Inaccessible Island. I thought it’d be appropriate to mention them here, since they are so teeny weeny.

In any case, that’s my summary of some featherweight flightless fellows you might find interesting. Hope you all enjoyed, thanks for reading, have a great day.
