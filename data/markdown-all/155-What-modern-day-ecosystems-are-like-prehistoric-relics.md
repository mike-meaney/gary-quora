There are some places in this world where, through geographical isolation or exceptionally stable climate conditions, flora and fauna largely extinct elsewhere have persisted for thousands, or often millions, of years. That's not to say these organisms haven't evolved at all, but rather that the lineages they belong to have avoided extinction, unlike in the rest of the world. These are my best examples.

*   The Gondwana rainforests of Australia. These forests, scattered across Queensland and New South Wales, are a refuge for a range of primitive organisms. The dominant tree species is the Antarctic beech, the closest relatives of which are found in Patagonia. This shows that they date back to the supercontinent Gondwana. Many of the local birds, such as bowerbirds and lyrebirds, are from a primitive Cretaceous lineage.

*   The Ukok Plateau of Siberia. During the last ice age, a grassland biome called the mammoth steppe spanned the length of northern Eurasia. It was home to huge megafauna. As the global climate became wetter, almost all of it disappeared, but due to Ukok's position in the rainshadow of the Altai Mountains, it retained its grassy steppe.

*   The Białowieża Forest, split between Poland and Belarus. It's the largest surviving remnant of Europe's primeval old-growth forests, the vast majority of which have been destroyed. Białowieża is a critical sanctuary for wildlife like bears, wolves, lynx, elk, wild horses, and even European bison - the largest land animal on the continent.

*   Mount Lico, a tabletop mountain in Mozambique. What were once the dense jungles of this country have largely been replaced by agricultural lands. However, Lico's rainforest is untouched, surrounded by sheer cliff faces. In fact, it was only formally explored in 2018, and a wealth of endemic species have been discovered there since.

*   Socotra, a remote island located between the Horn of Africa and Arabia. It's famous for its alien array of endemic wildlife and iconic dragon's blood trees. What's much lesser known is that these trees and many other weird Socotran plants are relics from the so-called Tethyan flora, vegetation which flourished in the Northern Hemisphere during dinosaur times.

*   Snowdonia, a mountainous region of northern Wales. It is the only place in Great Britain where you can find the Snowdon lily, a flower which was once found throughout the island. As the last Ice Age came to a close and the climate warmed, it mostly went extinct, but thanks to the high altitude and tundra-like climate, the lily persists in Snowdonia.

*   Vallée de Mai, a secluded jungle in Seychelles. This forest ecosystem is perhaps the only one dominated by palm trees, which have been superceded by newer, more advanced flora everywhere else in the world. The most iconic of these palms is the gigantic coco-de-mer, which has both the largest fruit and the largest seeds of any plant.

*   Lake Saimaa, the largest lake in Finland. During the Pleistocene, for a time, part of the Baltic Sea was ice-free, but still cut off from the Atlantic due to low sea levels. It became a freshwater lake, and animals adapted to that environment. Now that it's connected to the ocean, their descendants cling on in lakes like Saimaa - relict crustaceans, salmon and even freshwater ringed seals.

*   New Caledonia, the greatest stronghold for a group of conifers known as the araucarians. These trees once dominated the world - in fact, their towering height likely caused the sauropod dinosaurs to evolve their iconic long necks. Today, however, araucarians are few and far between - save for in New Caledonia, which has an amazing 20 species.

Those, to me, are the most outstanding examples of places in this world where geological time seems to have come to a standstill. Apologies for my lack of answers of late, I'm currently away from my computer, and writing on a phone can be quite fiddly and drawn-out.

Nevertheless, I won't stop! Thanks very much for reading everybody, have a great day.
