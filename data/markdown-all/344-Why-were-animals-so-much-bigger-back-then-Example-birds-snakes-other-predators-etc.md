At least in the recent past, humans are, as you might expect, to blame. For one thing, almost all of the Pleistocene megafauna has been wiped out due to human overhunting and competition. Palaeoloxodon namadicus, the largest land mammal ever to live, was likely driven extinct by humans.

Even in extant species, average size is in decline - again, we are at fault. Bergmann’s Rule states that in general, in warm-blooded species, populations further from the poles will be smaller. This is all to do with climate and temperature.

The larger you are, the more cells you have, and the more cells you have, the more heat you produce during respiration. In a hotter clime, you’ll have more trouble getting rid of that excess heat, so - due to global warming - smaller individuals are often more likely to survive and pass on their genes.

Fossil evidence shows this has happened in past periods of warming - one study found that after the PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum) 56 million years ago, insects apparently decreased in size by 50–75 percent.

There are other anthropogenic reasons for this dwarfing too. Above are some specimens of sea snails; the one on the right was from acidic water. Humans are currently acidifying the oceans, and the acid is eating away at the calcium carbonate shells of many mollusks. It also stunts the growth of phytoplankton.

And it’s not just animals - despite all the carbon dioxide we’re pumping into the atmosphere, plants too are shrinking due to unpredictable climate patterns and shorter winters.
