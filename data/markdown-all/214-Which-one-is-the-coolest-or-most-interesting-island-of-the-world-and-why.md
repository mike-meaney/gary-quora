I think it’d have to be Madagascar. There are definitely other contenders - namely Australia and New Zealand - but considering that the former is generally considered more of a continent than an island, and the latter is not one island but multiple, I’ll exclude them.

With an area of over 587,000 square kilometres, Madagascar is the fourth-largest island in the world, after Greenland, New Guinea and Borneo. For me, what is most interesting about it is its incredibly unique wildlife. Due to its isolation, around 90% of its species are endemic, found nowhere else on Earth.

The endemics it’s most famous for are its mammals, such as:

*   Lemurs, of course. The most well-known is the ring-tailed lemur, but the group is very diverse, containing five extant families and three extinct ones. Among the surviving species, the largest is the indri, the smallest is the mouse lemur, and the weirdest is definitely the aye-aye. All three are pictured.

*   The euplerids, the only carnivoran family found in only one country. These predators include the fossa (the largest of the group), as well as nine much lesser-known species, such as the falanoucs, vontsiras, and erroneously named Malagasy civets and Malagasy mongooses. The fossa is the apex predator of the island.

*   Tenrecs, a diverse family related to golden moles and sengis. The majority of species resemble shrews, but some are spiny like hedgehogs, while others burrow like moles. There’s even a muskrat-like aquatic species. Surprisingly, tenrecs are more closely related to manatees than they are to any of these animals - a great example of convergent evolution.

*   The bizarre sucker-footed bats, which form the family Myzopodidae. On their wrists and ankles, they have sticky pads from which they secrete adhesive fluid. This allows them to expertly climb the extra-smooth leaves of the traveller’s tree, which most potential parasites cannot scale. They’re also the only bats which don’t roost upside down.

*   A variety of interesting rodents. Unusually, all the rodents on Madagascar belong to a single African family - the nesomyids. The most well-known would be the Malagasy giant rat, pictured, which has the size and appearance of a rabbit, and can jump a metre into the air. Another interesting one is the beautifully named bastard big-footed mouse.

But it’s more than just the mammals that are fascinating on Madagascar. There are around 287 species of birds which live on the island. As birds can fly, they tend to disperse more easily, so less than half of these species - about 105, specifically - are only found there.

Among its bird-life are many beautiful feathered friends, such as the Madagascar blue pigeon,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-be1b22676d970cad2ae33571df7b737b-lq)

The Madagascar crested ibis,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-202b95972b9078ec24128eaa9a4d188b-lq)

Verreaux’s eagle-owl, the largest owl in Africa,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b097eb913eb9683dc126e2d941cfd506-lq)

And the Madagascan fish-eagle, possibly the rarest species of raptor in the world. There are only 40 breeding pairs left.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dfc871449f19fb4ddd61f772b2fb7cff-lq)

All those species are found only on Madagascar. However, they’re just isolated species - there are, in fact, several whole families of birds which are endemic to the island, or at least near-endemic (some are found on neighbouring small isles). They include:

*   Vangas, a group of birds which are typically black and white, resembling shrikes. However, there are several interesting variations and outliers - namely, the helmet vanga, which has a thick, bright blue bill, the sickle-billed vanga, which uses its thin, curved beak to probe soil, and the brilliantly coloured blue vanga.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-412c0baa6dfd175d6b3c1bade346cd77-lq)

*   The cuckoo-roller, a single species which has an entire order to itself, the Leptosomiformes. It’s quite strange for many reasons - it has an oversized head, with a stout beak and eyes set back far. Its feet are zygodactylous, with two toes facing forwards and two backward. Also, they’re unique among birds in that they are sit-and-wait ambush predators.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e9c2e1a905d067988ba7d17cf3d7db79-lq)

*   The asities, some of the planet’s most beautiful perching birds. The males of most species have brightly coloured fleshy wattles on their faces. The colour of these wattles is created by arrays of collagen fibres which reflect light in a specific way - in fact, no other animals have this. Additionally, asities have some of the shortest tails of any birds.

As well as mammals, Madagascar is also well-known for its chameleon fauna. In fact, about half of the world’s chameleon species live in this one island. Among them is the world’s largest chameleon, the Parson’s chameleon,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-63eca119d0730677e9f59d0a3bacb7b4-lq)

As well as the world’s smallest, Brookesia micra. At around an inch in length, it’s also one of the world’s smallest reptiles, and was only discovered in 2012.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-88618145fd56170ddfa0a6a16b20f282-lq)

And there’s also Labord’s chameleon, which has the shortest lifespan of any land vertebrate. It lives for only 4–5 months! They always hatch in November, then reach adulthood in January, mate and lay eggs in February, and die shortly thereafter. Because of this life cycle, there is an annual 7-month period when the species is extinct in the wild.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e9f49303b9afc09f9671454a933794f3-lq)

Coincidentally, Madagascar is also the only home of the world’s longest-lived land vertebrate, and it too is a reptile - the radiated tortoise. Tu’i Malila, a captive individual, died in 1965 at the age of 188.

This makes it the oldest tetrapod whose age has been determined with certainty. That being said, there is currently a living Seychelles tortoise who might be 187, and one Aldabra giant tortoise died at an unverified 255, so it might lose its crown in time.

There are many more incredible reptiles unique to the island of Madagascar, and amphibians too. Some of them are:

*   The two Madagascar blind-snakes, which are the sole species in the family Xenotyphlopidae. As its name suggests, it is completely blind. The head has a tough “shield”, used for burrowing, which makes it appear almost perfectly vertical. Discovered in 1905, Sadly, it’s critically endangered, and may inhabit only about 10 square kilometres of land.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7d35cc1a01977533b72f0128c4cebc54-lq)

*   The also critically endangered Madagascan big-headed turtle. As its name suggests, its most noticeable feature is its very large head. Evolutionarily, it’s highly unique, having diverged from all other turtles 80 million years ago. Because of this, it is the highest land vertebrate on the EDGE list, which ranks species based on a) their endangerment as well as b) their uniqueness.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-66825e2a4c07695be93ac0b849cc7697-lq)

*   A wide variety of beautiful frogs. There is a near-endemic family (also found in Mayotte, a small island) known as the mantellas, which are essentially the Malagasy answer to Latin America’s poison dart frogs. Another example of convergent evolution at work. Another notable group are the tomato frogs, in which the females are very large and bright red.

Continuing our tour, we have a huge variety of invertebrates, which I’ll have to skim through. Here are some of my favourites:

*   The giraffe weevil, a favourite of many a macrophotographer. As you’ve probably guessed, the reason it’s called the giraffe weevil is because of its huge, extended neck. Males, which are 3 times bigger than females, use it for fighting other males, whereas females use it for building nests. They do this by rolling leaves into a tube.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a94c74ddfc962d8df6ce151c27487495-lq)

*   The Dracula ants. There are many species all over the world in this group, but Madagascar has an especially high number of them. They’re famous for their macabre habit of drinking the blood of their own larvae in lean times. One Madagascan species, Mystrium capillae, can snap its jaws shut with dumbfounding speeds of 90 metres per second.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bffd3149f00422794327454ea203d4d4-lq)

*   Proboscidoplocia, which is the largest species of mayfly in the world. Mayflies are usually a few millimetres in length, but the larvae of this genus reach seven centimetres. They’re aquatic, and have rows of feathery gills on each side, which ripple in an almost mesmerizing way. Madagascar is a hotspot of mayfly diversity, with around 200 species (of which all but one are endemic).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c208c4add974f364bb2bb7a4be547fbe-pjlq)

*   The Madagascan fire millipede, the most beautiful myriapod in the world, in my opinion. Scientifically termed Aphistogoniulus corallipes, its carapace is scarlet red and black, while its legs are a fiery orange colour. Because of their attractive colours, they are popular as pets. Other than this, I can’t find much information on them.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-42973d426816658755c0e3ab1407b2fa-lq)

*   The Madagascar shell-squatting spider, Olios coenobiticus. This amazing species uses threads of silk to hoist snail shells off the ground, creating a home for the spider which is sheltered and safe from predators. This could even be seen as tool use. Unfortunately, very little is known about the shell-squatting spider, and the photos we do have of them aren’t of the best quality.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7bb93f81e863d073e5420bfffe61c754-lq)

*   Darwin’s bark spider, even more amazing than the previous arachnid. The webs they build are the largest in the world, with 2.8 square metre surface areas. These webs span across entire rivers! The silk they use to build these webs is the toughest biological material in the world by a factor of two, ten times stronger than Kevlar. They also have fascinating mating habits, but that’s a story for another day.

To top it all off, there are many unique plants in Madagascar, some of them entire unique families. Baobab trees are an absolute icon of the island, and six of the world’s nine baobab species are only found on Madagascar. This includes by far the largest and most spectacular one, Grandidier’s baobab.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8d9bbf9dddbabf671de6f9247a3940ea-lq)

There’s also the bizarre-looking octopus tree, which is 10 metres tall and densely covered in spines,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cef3905006f818eb806479034fa14116-lq)

The iconic traveller’s tree, which I mentioned in my dossier of the sucker-footed bats,

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-624a7fe4192e8ee5f923d4b7f6f4c359-lq)

And the Madagascar periwinkle. It might look normal enough, but it’s the only source of the important drugs vincristine and vinblastine, used in the treatment of cancer.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b147f41a2abc90c0c3a4e936de9c3870-lq)

And that’s just the extant wildlife of the island. During the last Ice Age, there were lemurs as big as gorillas, giant eagles, giant fossas, giant tortoises, and the largest birds of all time, all on Madagascar. Living alongside them were dwarf hippos (the only ungulates ever to inhabit the island) and crocodiles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cd91d995e1de409fe0ea7d1accf9a5ce-lq)

From the point of view of animals and plants, Madagascar is one of the most unique and interesting places in the entire world. And that’s not to mention some of its amazing landscapes, such as the world’s largest stone forest:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cf857eb1da5299ed46ddf9a5c99a5fb8-lq)

And its unusual history. Despite only being about 400 kilometers from mainland Africa, it was never settled until about 350 BC - the third-last major landmass to be colonized, after New Zealand and Antarctica. And those first settlers came not from Africa, but all the way from Indonesia!

So, because of all this, I think it’s safe to say if we eliminate Oz and NZ, no other island comes close to the wacky allure of Madagascar.
