I am not a historian or an archaeologist, but I do remember reading something about exotic animal traffickers in ancient Rome.

If I remember correctly, indigenous African hunters would chase a lion into a deep pit. Later, a cage with bait of meat in was lowered, and the lion would be encouraged to step in.

I don’t believe the text said anything about what happened after that, but I imagine that the cage would have been carried by several men to the coast, where a ship would be waiting.

The Romans definitely did transport animals by ship. Here is a mosaic from an ancient villa that shows the transport of exotic animals:

On the ship’s left side, two stressed-looking ostriches and a bovid of some kind are being led onto the ship, while on the right (Which I presume represents the ship at its destination) displays the animals being taken down a ramp to their grisly fate.

This mosaic is known as “The Big Game Hunt”, and a quick google search of the phrase yields more pictures.

This one shows an African elephant being pulled, on a leash, onto a ship in a similar manner.

Then there’s this one. This tigress has a harness on her, and is being threatened by a sword or machete of some sort. Given the nature of the leash on her, I presume they transported tigers just as they did elephants and ostriches.

That mosaic is the only source I know of that tells us much about the transport of exotic animals in Roman times, so I hope this answer helps.
