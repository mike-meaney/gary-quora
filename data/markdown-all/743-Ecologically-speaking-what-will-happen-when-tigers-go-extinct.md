Well, this is a very interesting topic to speculate on. When one tier of the trophic pyramid is removed, there are a number of scenarios that may occur.

Letâ€™s say we have a subtropical dry forest ecosystem in India. Tigers are at the top, and they eat deer, which eat plants.

If the tigers are removed, then the deer have no predators, which causes their population to expand uncontrollably. However, this situation is unlikely to last long without the vacant niche being filled. There are 3 things that could happen here:

*   Enter another local deer-eating species, for example, a dhole. This is a type of small, fox-like wild dog that can take down large prey. With it would come its own predators, e.g. leopards.
*   Captive tigers are introduced into the area by conservationists. If you mean extinct as in extinct in captivity as well, then they might introduce ligers or tigons as a proxy.
*   A very small surviving population resists the extinction and reinstates its dominance in the food chain. Again, if you mean total extinction, this would not occur.

I hope I answered your question well, thanks for asking.
