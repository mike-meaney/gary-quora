We’ve had a lot of bizarre headlines over the past while, but [this one](https://kaleistyleguide.com/news/2021/01/17/colombias-rapidly-breeding-cocaine-hippos-must-stopped-scientists/ "kaleistyleguide.com") is definitely up there with some of the weirdest:

For context, back in the ’80s the infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar maintained a personal menagerie in Hacienda Nápoles, his lavish Colombian estate. Among the animals to be found there were four common hippopotamuses.

Following Escobar’s death, the property fell into disrepair and the hippos were left behind, as it would have been too costly to transport them elsewhere. Over time they spread out in the local wilderness and started reproducing. There were 16 by 2007, 40 by 2014, and perhaps 70 by 2018.

Today, it’s estimated that there may be as many 120 hippos in Colombia, spread out over a 2,000 square kilometre range which spans multiple departments of the country. It’s thought the ecosystem could sustain this accelerating population growth until there are at least 200 of them.

Is this bad? Possibly. Hippos attack and kill people more frequently than any other wild mammal, killing around 500 people in Africa annually. There have been no injuries or deaths in Colombia - yet - but the hippos have tried to attack people on some occasions.

Additionally, there’s the obvious issue that they are a foreign species to the South American ecosystem. Limited changes in the nutrient content and cyanobacteria populations have been observed in the water the Colombian hippos inhabit, which may increase with the population. They also might outcompete native species.

That being said, there are ecologists who argue that they could actually benefit the local environment. In the last few tens of thousands of years, a vast number of large land animal species have been wiped out, quite possibly due to humans.

In Colombia, there were a variety of now-extinct grazing creatures, including giant armadillos like Glyptodon, wild horses like Hippidion, huge herbivorous rodents such as Neochoerus, and an entire order of hooved animals called the litopterns. One litoptern, Toxodon, is especially reminiscent of a hippo.

In any case, some argue that the hippos could help refill the niches left empty following the extinction of these grass-eating herbivores. This idea is known as Pleistocene rewilding, and it’s a controversial topic in itself, especially when it comes to using extant species as analogues for unrelated extinct ones.

So, in conclusion, there is a possibility that a hippopotamus population in Colombia might be beneficial for the ecosystem, but the general consensus among conservationists is that their numbers need to be controlled as soon as possible.
