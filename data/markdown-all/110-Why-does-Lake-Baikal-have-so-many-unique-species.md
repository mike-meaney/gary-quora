So, for those who don’t know, Baikal is an enormous lake in Siberia, equivalent in area to Belgium. In fact, by volume it’s the largest body of freshwater in the world, containing some 26,000 cubic kilometres of H2O. And it happens to be a hive of biodiversity, housing thousands upon thousands of species - most of which are found nowhere else.

Its most well-known endemic is the Baikal seal, or nerpa - a majestically globular creature which is the world’s only species of freshwater seal and the smallest pinniped alive today. I wrote on its mysterious origins before, here: [Gary Meaney's answer to How did a population of landlocked seals manage to establish itself in Lake Baikal, of all places?,](https://www.quora.com/How-did-a-population-of-landlocked-seals-manage-to-establish-itself-in-Lake-Baikal-of-all-places-at-an-altitude-of-450-m-and-several-hundred-kilometers-from-the-Nearest-coastline/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")

The lake also has three whole families of endemic fish. Of these, the most common and interesting one is the golomyankas. Also known as Baikal oilfish, they have no scales, no skin pigment, no pelvic fins, no swim bladders, and no cone cells in their eyes. About 70% of the fish in Baikal are either of the two species of golomyanka.

Almost 40% of a golomyanka’s bodyweight is just fatty oil, which is used in place of a swim bladder to regulate buoyancy. In my opinion, they’re easily the strangest freshwater fish in the world.

I should also mention one of the lake’s most alien creatures - the acanthogammarids. These are an endemic family of large, spiny amphipod crustaceans, and they look downright bizarre.

There are many more endemics in Baikal which I could go on about, but I must address the main question - why does this lake have thousands of endemic species? Part of the answer is isolation. Lakes are to aquatic creatures what islands are to land-dwelling ones - surrounded by an impassable “sea”.

So, when populations of organisms end up in the lake, very little genetic admixture occurs with their counterparts outside the lake. Before long, a new species emerges and it cannot leave Baikal, because of isolation.

It also helps that Lake Baikal is the oldest lake in the world. It formed about 25–30 million years ago, when the Eurasian plate drifted apart from the Amur plate, creating a rift in between which was filled with water. Thus, the lake has been isolated for a very long time, time enough to accumulate countless species.

Secondly, there’s the factor of depth. Baikal holds many world records - not only is it the most voluminous, the oldest and also one of the clearest lakes in the world, it’s the planet’s deepest as well. Its deepest point is some 1,642 metres below the surface, which is incredible.

The thing with a very deep lake is that as you move down, the pressure increases rapidly. If a fish finds itself under more (or less) water pressure than its body is adapted for, it dies. Since a given species can only survive in a certain band of depth, deeper lakes always have more species.

In short, a combination of isolation from land and incredible depth breed the perfect conditions for endemism in Baikal. I’ll leave you with one last fact - of all the surface freshwater on Earth, one-fifth of it is found in this one lake. That’s more than all the Great Lakes combined!
