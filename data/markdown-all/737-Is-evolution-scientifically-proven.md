Original question: Is there proof for evolution? If so, where is it?

It depends what you mean by proof. Technically, there is no proof that your foot isn’t actually a type of fruit which grows on cacti. However, based on what we observe about the universe, we can assume that it isn’t. Similarly, we can observe the tremendous amounts of evidence, not proof, and conclude that it is the most plausible theory for the origin of species and life itself.

In the absence of proof (That same absence is seen for everything except math and logic), I will at least present you with evidence. So, here it is;

* * *

Morphology: just like Darwin on his voyage on the Beagle, we can observe that some populations of species differ, morphologically, from other members of the species, which are found elsewhere. Upon seeing this, Charles Darwin concluded that they must have had a common ancestor, but their morphology had changed over time. The most famous example are Darwin’s finches and their specialized beaks, as well as the giant tortoises (Grazing varieties have a lip over the top of their shell’s neck-hole, browsers don’t because they need to reach upwards).

Phylogenetics: this is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for evolution. Looking at the differences in organisms’ morphology, you might conclude that some were more closely related to others. Obviously, the more related they are, the more similar their genes. So, when we sequence those organisms’ DNA, we find that it completely supports the idea that some species are more related than others. Using that information, we can construct accurate diagrams of evolutionary progress called phylogenetic trees.

Ontogeny: Ontogenesis is, simply put, the origination and development of an organism before it reaches its mature form. Looking at the embryological development of organisms which we surmise to be more related to each other, we see that the ones we deem more closely related have embryos which look similar for longer during development, and that the earlier in development an organism is, the simpler and more similar to others it is.

Biogeography: over time, populations of species tend to change in their range and distribution, often migrating large distances. The further away from the original range a population of animals goes, the more isolated their genes become, meaning that all their descendants will come from a relatively small genetic mix. Thousands or millions of years of genetic isolation will render the migrated population quite different from the original population, simply because the migrated one can’t access the original one’s genes.

Vestiges: maintaining any body part costs energy. In lean times, energy is a scarce resource, and the ones that spend less energy one non-beneficial things are more likely to survive and reproduce. For example, say that you have a population of early Cetaceans. They use their tails and their webbed forelimbs to swim, but they still have hind-limbs, which they don’t really use. If one is born with small hind-limbs, he spends less energy maintaining them, and is more likely to reproduce. We see many modern animals that have these leftover traits, or “vestiges”, from their ancestors.

Speciation: a species is, according to biologists, a group of organisms which cannot breed - under normal conditions - with any other group of organisms. Speciation is a term for when a new species arises. Diane Dodd, a biologist, did an experiment on fruit flies, where she fed one group on maltose food and one group on starch food. She kept them isolated for quite some time, and when she re-introduced them to eachother, the two groups would almost never breed with a fly from the other group.

Comparative anatomy: in case your morphology, ontogeny, phylogenetics and biogeography isn’t enough, this is another way you can check which species are more related. Take for example, the theory that the family Hippopotamidae is the closest relative of the infraorder Cetacea. Both animals (hippos and whales) have multi-chambered stomachs, no hair, give birth and nurse underwater, have internal reproductive organs, and basal, legged Cetaceans had the same ankle structure as hippos, which isn’t seen anywhere else.

Geologic stratigraphy: if organisms do truly become more complex over time, then we would expect that if we looked at fossils of distantly related animals from several different time periods, then the more recent the period, the more complex they would be. And indeed, we do. By looking at the radioactive decay of certain elements, we can gauge how old a rock is, and all the older rocks contain fossils of simpler organisms than the more recent ones. For example, the wing of a bird is more complex than the display feathers of a Dromaeosaur, and the bird wing evolved after the Dromaeosaur feathers.

Atavisms: if an organism lost an organ to evolutionary change, we would expect the genes not to disappear from it completely, but to go inactive, since that’s how evolution is supposed to work. And if the genes were in its sequence, but inactive, we could expect that mutation during development could “turn the genes on” and give the organism a trait that had been lost. And that is what we see, for humans can be born with tails, whales with legs and horses with toes.

Ring species: say you have a large geographic obstacle, like a large island. And, say that there is a population of coastal fish on the south side of the island. One population starts to move north-east, sticking to the coastal areas, but moving away from the south side. Over dozens or hundreds of generations, the fish population slowly edges north, until it has reached the north side of the island. In search of pastures new, the movement continues, and hundreds of generations later, there are populations of fish ringing the whole island. But the two populations at the south side cannot breed - they can only mate with the population immediately counter-clockwise to them.

E. coli LTEE: the E. coli. Long-term Evolution Experiment is an ongoing project by Richard Lenski. Starting with a strain of Escherichia coli, he divided the bacteria into 12 isolated populations. For over 20 years, he has observed how they have changed over time, as there have been around 70,000 generations already. Over this time, he has provided incredible amounts of hard evidence for evolution, showing trends of convergent phenotypes (Such as increased cell size, which occured in all 12 populations), ecological specialization, and most impressively - new, strange abilities. One of the (once-thought) characteristics of E. coli. is that it cannot grow on citrate - yet Lenski’s bacteria evolved to do so.

Viruses: have you ever wondered why you have to get a flu shot every year? Viruses, including flu viruses, are the most rapidly mutating organisms (Or para-organisms - whether they’re alive or not is controversial) in the world, and every flu season, they’ve usually evolved to become immune to last year’s vaccine. Their generation time is very short, and thus their genes mutate extremely quickly.

Pseudogenes: Creationists often argue that two cars, such as a Chevy and a Chrysler, contain many of the same parts, but are obviously not descended from one another, and that their similar parts are because they have a common designer - man. Obviously, they’re not really talking about cars, they’re talking about organisms - and specifically, homologs. Well, to them, I would use the metaphor that when cars switch from carburators to fuel injectors, the designers don’t leave a broken carburator in the car - but evolution does. A pseudogene is, basically, a gene that is on the verge of inactivation, yet is still present - strong evidence for evolution.

Endemism: some species, as you may know, are restricted to a single geographic area - for example, the orange-breasted sunbird is only found in fynbos vegetation in South Africa. The state of being geographically isolated like this is called endemism. And, using what we know about gene isolation, we would expect that endemic species would have adapted to the special environment of their habitat, and couldn’t survive well elsewhere - otherwise, why wouldn’t they have pushed into surrounding habitats? And, yet again, our expectations are confirmed, showing that one of two related species is adapted for a special environment.

Avida: Avida is a software platform where evolutionary biologists study a self-replicating, mutating computer program, to see if complex features can evolve from simple ones. Natural selection was simulated by having multiple computer programs which “competed” for processor time and access to main memory, so that the programs with favorable mutations would overcome those without. Over time, the complexity of the programs increased and increased, until they were nigh unrecognizable when compared to the original.

So, is there proof for evolution? It depends on what you consider proof. Do you think that there’s proof that your foot isn’t a cactus fruit? If so, then by that definition; yes, there is proof.

That is, I’d say that there’s proof for what Young Earth Creationists call “micro-evolution”. We can see it in domestic animals, fruit flies, E. coli, mosquitoes and iguanas. Speciation has occured during human history, and experiments prove evolution to be possible.

YECs, however, beget so-called “macro-evolution” - there’s no hard definition, but Answers in Genesis consider it to be one species turning into a new taxonomic family (Which is quite un-scientific - modern cladistics shows that families, orders and classes don’t exist in nature, just clades). Well, what I say to them is; micro or macro, it’s all evolution. In nature, you can’t get half the package. You can’t get part of gravity without the rest. And, given enough time, micro-evolution will turn into macro-.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and please; see the world as it really is, not as some surmise it to be. If you beget evolution, then that’s fine, but present evidence - real evidence. You can question science, but not without factual basis.
