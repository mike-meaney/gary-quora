No known ones. This sounds like a great premise for an All Yesterdays concept, but it seems unlikely to me.

First of all, we must look at the difference between horns and antlers. A horn has a bone core surrounded by a sheath of keratin. On the other hand, an antler is made entirely of bone, with a velvet covering. Horns are kept all year round, but antlers are shed yearly.

In the horned dinosaurs, we can see the “core” of the horns, which look like cones protruding from the skull. However, these are not the actual horns, which would have been larger and keratinous.

However, if we found a dinosaur with antlers, we would know immediately, because they are in fact extensions of the skull. The forked shape of an antler would be seen in any complete skull.

Therefore, I do not think that we will find a dinosaur that has antlers. Thanks for asking.
