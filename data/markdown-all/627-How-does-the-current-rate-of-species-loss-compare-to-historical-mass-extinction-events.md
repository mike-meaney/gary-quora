There isn’t much data on the rate of previous mass extinctions per se, rather than the percentage of fossil species which disappear. However, I can make a guess based on the nature of these extinctions.

End-Ordovician:

I would put the Holocene extinction at a slower rate than this one. The changes in the End-Ordovician event were seriously drastic; the sea level fell by a huge 100 metres. That’s literally deeper than the entire euphotic zone - the layer where virtually every alga and phytoplankton is found, along with almost all the sea creatures we’re familiar with.

End-Devonian:

There are still a number of hypotheses on what caused these extinctions (yes, extinctions, plural. It was actually two events.), but the plant evolution theory seems promising. According to it, the widespread success of the first trees and the expansion of forests weathered tons of soil (causing a rapid input of minerals to the oceans) and cooled the climate. In any case, it was prolonged, and thus I’d say it was either roughly the same speed as or slower than the current extinction.

End-Permian:

This extinction is also mysterious, but let’s go with the favoured hypothesis - the eruption of the Siberian Traps. The volcanism could’ve also triggered a population boom in methane-producing bacteria, causing climate change. The extinction is estimated to have lasted 60,000 years, which is already shorter than the Sixth Mass Extinction, so this would have to have a higher rate of death.

End-Triassic:

The cause of this one is not known, as all of the purported ideas have seemingly fatal flaws. However, what we do know is that the disappearances lasted about 10,000 years in the fossil record. Given that the Holocene extinction started about 100,000 years ago, the Tr-J extinction must have been faster.

End-Cretaceous:

This one must have been faster than what we’re doing to the planet. We couldn’t possibly create an explosion so large with all the nuclear bombs in the world. Couple this explosion with acid rain, sulfur clouds cloaking the Earth, global wildlfires and massive tsunamis, it simply seems implausible to suppose that this was less of a sudden extinction than what’s happening now.

So, looking at this brief review of the Big Five, it seems as though the Anthropocene Extinction would have the slowest - or second-slowest - rate of species extinction. If I’m honest, I’d say that this event will be the mildest mass extinction the Earth has yet seen, even in terms of total number of species extinctions. Nevertheless, on a human scale, it’s a catastrophe.
