Anglerfish are probably the most extremely dimorphic of vertebrates:

Super birds of paradise are also a good example:

My favourite instance of extreme sexual dimorphy, however, is the green spoonworm:

Number one is a female, number three a larvaâ€¦ and number two a male. The male is hundreds of times smaller than the female, living inside her body. All spoonworms are born female - if a larva is touched by an adult female, she becomes a he.
