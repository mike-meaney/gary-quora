For this we need to know:

1.  The strength exerted in jumping
2.  The spot which the tiger was aiming for.

There are no known units of measure that could be used to quantify the effort exerted in the jump, but the answer will probably be equivalent to Number 2.

Tigers are very, very good at jumping. If they aim for 3 metres, they will jump 3 metres almost everytime.

Another note: I'm not sure if a tiger could survive such a jump. They are far better than humans at jumping when it comes to landing on their feet, but our very flexible spines mean we can roll to absorb impacts.
