NOTE: Please read through to the end of my answer.

1.  All living organisms do not have DNA in common.
2.  We have never observed a speciation event.
3.  Ancestral traits (e.g. legs in whales) do not reappear by chance mutations.
4.  Organism embryos do not look more similar the younger they are.
5.  We cannot classify every living thing into a single tree of life.
6.  Related organisms do not share similar anatomies.
7.  Organisms do not retain vestigial organs.
8.  The fossil record does not line up, from simplest to most complex, showing a clear transition from bacteria to modern organisms.
9.  There are no transitional fossils.
10.  Closer related organisms do not live on closer landmasses.
11.  Ring species do not exist.
12.  We can’t change wild animals into wildly different domestic ones.
13.  Artificial selection experiments have failed to produce different results.
14.  Microbes don’t adapt to combat antibiotics.
15.  Simple computer programs under selection pressures cannot become complex.

Oh wait… everything I just said is not true. I guess evolution’s a fact…
