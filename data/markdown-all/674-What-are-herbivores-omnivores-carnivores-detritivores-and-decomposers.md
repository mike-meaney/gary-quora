A herbivore is an animal that eats plant matter.

There are many types of herbivores. Grazers eat grass, browsers eat leaves, frugivores eat fruit, xylophages eat wood, and there are also forms adapted for consumption of seaweed, moss, and nuts.

Moving on, a carnivore is an animal that eats other animals.

Once again, there a multitude of sub-diets contained within carnivory. The two major groups are predators and scavengers. Scavengers eat dead animals not killed by themselves, and predators kill prey, then eat it. Within the predator category, there are a few types. Active predators hunt down prey and chase it, while filter-feeders merely allow it to pass into their mouths. Ambush predators hide, then surprise their prey and kill it, and pack hunters kill with the aid of others. Also, some carnivores eat insects only -insectivores.

An omnivore is an animal that eats both meat and vegetation.

Omnivores have a bunch of characteristics which make them different from other animals:

1.  They are generalists, so can survive abrupt changes in climate/environment better than other animals.
2.  Their generalism means that they can also adapt to new places quickly. An example would be how foxes and raccoons have colonized, and thrived in, our cities.
3.  They are opportunistic, which means that they are usually more intelligent than some other animals.
4.  If one food source goes, they can lean harder on the other, which gives them an advantage over strict herbivores/hypercarnivoran animals.

A detritivore is a type of carnivore that eats small amounts of dead animals killed by something other than themselves.

It is this that separates them from scavengers - a term usually used to describe a large, macroscopic animal that can demolish a carcass in days or weeks. Some examples of detritivorous creatures are millipedes, worms and woodlice.

Lastly, a decomposer is a micro-organism that utilizes enzymes to speed up chemical reactions and break down a dead animalâ€™s carcass.
