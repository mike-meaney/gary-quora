## What is the likelihood that a true dinosaur species (not a bird) survived hidden in the African jungles?

I assume you’re referring to the Mokele-mbembe, a 200-year old legend from the days of “darkest Africa”, which is supposed by cryptozoologists and even our good friends the Young Earth Creationists to be a sauropod dinosaur.

The Mokele-mbembe first came to the attention of Europeans when a French missionary in the Congo reported finding huge, clawed footprints - a forgivable misinterpretation of the tracks of forest elephants. Later, in 1909, Carl Hagenbeck reported seeing a beast that was “half-elephant, half-dragon”.

Overall, the classic image of the Mokele-mbembe is a semi-aquatic, swamp-dwelling sauropod. Sound familiar? The description perfectly matches the fat, sluggish reconstructions of sauropods which were so prevalent at the time, but known to be wrong by modern paleontologists.

As I said before, the Mokele mbembe is an old legend, and almost certainly nothing more. Most of these sightings were during an age where the Western world was experiencing a dinosaur craze, and Europeans and North Americans thought that Africa was a primitive “lost world” of cavemen, where wild beasts could be lurking around every corner (Extant sauropods have also been reported in Zimbabwe, the Sahel and South Africa).

So, that’s my first point - this Mokele mbembe seems to coincide all too suspiciously with that era’s “dinosaur craze”, its understanding of sauropod biology and its perception of Africa as some backwater jungle world that has gone unchanged since the age of dinosaurs.

Now, let’s just ignore that coincidence, and ask the questions; “Could it theoretically exist?” and “What is it?”. Let me say first off that it is almost certainly not a sauropod. We typically see a pattern in fossils that the larger the bones are, the more likely they are to be fossilized.

Sauropods are pretty damn big, in case you haven’t noticed, and if this animal is supposed to be a swamp-dweller, you’d expect the muddy sediments of its habitat to make its preservation as a fossil even more likely. There are gaps in the fossil record, but not ones like this.

So, if it’s not a sauropod, what is it? If it does truly exist, it could be a lot of things - it has been hypothesized to be a varanid lizard, a crocodilian, a turtle and even a giant pangolin by various people over the years.

But what about the stories and legends of the natives?, you may ask. As Matthew Haynes has put brilliantly, it could be a part of the local mythology. Perhaps some pygmy saw a crocodile kill a hippo and the stories got exaggerated.

This picture, however, puts a whole new spin on the whole story. Pictured above is a Florida softshell turtle, Apalone ferox, scaled up to the size of the largest recorded softshell turtles from Africa. Beside them - to scale - are African pygmy people, which I believe are members of the Mbuti or Bambuti group. In this respect, it’s not unreasonable to think that sightings of one of these could have led to such stories

If the Mokele mbembe is anything, it’s probably that. In conclusion; The Mokele-mbembe almost certainly does not exist. It is unrepresented in the fossil record, has not been found by the many expedition parties that have searched for it, and its sightings coincide suspiciously with various trends typical of the era.
