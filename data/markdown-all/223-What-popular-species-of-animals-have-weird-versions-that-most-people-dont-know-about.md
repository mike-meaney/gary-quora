The list is so long that I could be here all day, but here are some notable examples. Also, I don’t usually say this, but since this time it’s one Mr. Kernan, thanks for the A2A!

You’ve heard of mussels, now get ready for the snuffbox mussel

Epioblasama triqueta, commonly known as the snuffbox mussel, is a freshwater mussel with an amazing (and bloody metal) method of reproduction. Using a fleshy lure which resembles a small fish, it attracts larger fish, and then clamps its “jaws” around the victim’s head, pumping its gills full of larvae.

It’s found on the eastern coast of the United States and Canada, and it’s unfortunately listed as endangered in both countries.

You’ve heard of snails, now get ready for violet sea-snails

There are several species of sea snail in two genera (Janthina and Recluzia), not all of which are violet, that have an ingenious way of getting around. They trap bubbles of air using a thin, transparent coat of chitin, and - with the aid of their extremely lightweight shells - float along the surface.

Coincidentally, they are a predator of the Portuguese man o’ war (among other siphonophores), just like the blanket octopus in Sean’s answer.

You’ve heard of lobsters, now get ready for slipper lobsters

Yeah, these guys are just… really weird. Up to half a metre long and flattened in shape, their most conspicuous feature is the pair of broad, rounded plates which protrude from the head. What are these, I hear you ask?

They’re the slipper lobsters’ antennae. I told you they were weird.

You’ve heard of geckoes, now get ready for Pygopodidae

The various species of legless skink are weird, but still pretty reasonable. Legless geckoes, on the other hand? That’s just plain bizarre. Where their hind limbs once were, they have two little vestigial flaps, which could be for courtship, defensive displays, or even locomotion.

They essentially fill the niche of snakes, and some species even eat normal geckoes. This would make sense if they evolved in somewhere like Ireland, which has no native snakes, but pygopodids are native to Australia (and Papua New Guinea), which has more snake species than almost any other country. Evolution can always surprise us.

You’ve heard of sea urchins, now get ready for Toxopneustes

This has got to be the weirdest species of urchin there is. On the end of each spine, it has a pincer-like structure with three claws. Stretched around these claws is a fleshy membrane which turns each pincer into a venomous suction cup.

Touch a Toxopneustes sea urchin, and you’ll be in for a bad time. The cups stick to your fingers and detach, injecting venom into you in what is allegedly an “extremely painful” experience.

Those are my five top picks for species which stand out among otherwise standard, well-known groups of animals. Again, as I said, there’s a boundless selection of such taxa, but I can only write so much. Thanks for reading.
