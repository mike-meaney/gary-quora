It’s not a swamp, but it is a wetland, and a swamp is just a forested wetland. Leopards are found in the Okavango delta, like this one:

If they can survive here, then the answer to your question is yes, they can. The introduction of trees wouldn’t have any negative effect; in fact, it’d just provide more cover for hunting.
