Well, I suppose their Argument 1 is “But people did that.”

Any evolutionist versed in natural selection’s mechanisms would soon reply with “The environment and its pressures fill the role of humans.”, which sidesteps the most shortsighted of arguments.

Then, those creationists who have considered this themselves bring up their Argument 2; “We don’t know that the environment can do that amount of derivation.”

Mine and your response to that would probably be “It can over millions of years.”

This is where we hit a roadblock. The evolutionist believes the Earth is billions of years old, where the creationist says that the Earth is young.

One could argue that fossils, strata and all that prove that the Earth is very, very old - and they do - but in this field, many creationists seem to not only deny evolution but basic science. Therefore, people informed about science have technically disproved Creation - at least as the Genesis tells it.

So, really, it’s a matter of belief and disbelief. If you don’t believe the Earth is old, then you don’t believe in evolution. Since it’s almost proven that the Earth has existed for eons, that kind of makes all creationists conspiracy theorists, according to science.

Before any creationist readers - and I believe there will be some, since I think I have a few theist followers - start arguing in the comments, let me tell you one thing.

I have absolutely no problem with you believing that God created the Earth. If Jesus returns and proves His existence, then great. I’d be happy for you.

While it is true that I do not believe in God, I am agnostic and have no problem with you believing what you want to believe.

Now that I’ve cleared that up, I hope I answered your question well, and thanks for asking me.
