## Since the blowhole is a modified nostril, could dolphins and whales smell through it?

No, they lack an olfactory lobe and, therefore, cannot smell through their blow-hole.

But can they smell? It depends on how you define smell. Cetaceans have a highly developed sense of taste, and taste and smell are grouped closely in the category of chemical senses - smell is, basically, a modified sense of taste.

So, in short; no, but they taste instead.
