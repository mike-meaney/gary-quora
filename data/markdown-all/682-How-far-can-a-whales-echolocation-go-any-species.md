From [Whales Online](https://baleinesendirect.org/en/ "baleinesendirect.org"):

> For example, the common bottlenose dolphin can locate targets just over 110 m away, which is impressive for an animal that hunts near the water surface.

Whale by some definitions is a polyphyletic term, being applied to all baleen whales and sperm whales, which are toothed whales.

If that’s what you mean by whale, I can’t find any information on their sonar range (sperm whales are the only “whales” which have sonar). However, if you just mean “Cetacean”, then there you go.
