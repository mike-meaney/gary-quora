Tortoises evolved from semiaquatic turtles, which evolved from lizard-like reptiles covered in scutes. The closest living relatives of turtles are the archosaurs, whose surviving members are crocodiles and birds but once included nonavian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and a load of weird crocodile-like critters.

The evolution of turtles (by the way, to be strictly accurate, turtles and tortoises are not different things but the latter is a subset of the former) is fairly well-documented, and we have quite a lot of transitional fossils.

Pappochelys was an early not-quite turtle which didnâ€™t yet have a shell per se, but did have bony scute armour. It also had broad, flattened ribs which would have protected its internal organs and would later become a carapace.

Moving forward in time to 220 million years ago, we have Odontochelys, the oldest known turtle. All modern turtles have their shells in two parts - the carapace on top and the plastron on the bottom. Odontochelys had a plastron and a sort of half-carapace.

The first known turtle to have a complete shell, with a full carapace, plastron, the whole package, was Proganochelys from roughly 210 million years ago. It had spikes on its neck and on its tail, which is cool.

Now, the turtle order is divided into two main groups - the older Pleurodires or side-necked turtles and the more successful Cryptodires, or hidden-necked turtles. As their name suggests, the latter group lack exposed necks and are thus better protected against predators. Tortoises are Cryptodires.

Cryptodira appeared in the middle of the Jurassic period, according to the fossil record, and its earliest known assured member is called Kayentachelys, pictured below with an early mammal relative and a pair of dilophosaurs.

Now, we get to tortoises. The first appearance of the tortoise family (Testudinidae) was a little harder to track down on the Internet, but after a while on the Paleobiology Database I pinned it down to Stylemys of Eocene North America. Stylemys was probably a herbivore, and was evidently a poor burrower compared to modern tortoises.

So there you go, the complete evolutionary history of tortoises from pre-turtles to much more familiar forms.
