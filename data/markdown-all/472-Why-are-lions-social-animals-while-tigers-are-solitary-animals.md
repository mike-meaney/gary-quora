All big cats, except for lions and some cheetahs, are solitary. It’s how they’ve evolved to live, and lion sociability is rather unusual among cats.

I share the theory with several other zoologists that lions are social because of their unique ecology.

The African savanna is quite a unique ecosystem. The combination of massive prey animals like elephants and rhinos and powerful predators such as hyenas makes for a scenario seen nowhere else on Earth.

Lions are big, powerful, muscular cats, capable of taking down large prey on their own. That mind sound like a good thing, but in many ways it isn’t. A large carcass on the savanna will attract scavengers from miles around. Spotted hyenas, saber-toothed cats and [giant hyenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachycrocuta "en.wikipedia.org") would chase a lone lion off a kill.

Carcasses are much easier to defend in numbers. It is this, many believe, that caused lions to be social. Pride-living indeed has its drawbacks, but this solution to the problem has brought lions many advantages in the wild. With more lions, they can take down massive prey like giraffes and elephants and afford to keep the carcass.

So, it is this unique combination of the ability to tackle large prey and the presence of more powerful predators that has encouraged lions to live in prides.

Thanks for asking, and I hope I answered your question well.
