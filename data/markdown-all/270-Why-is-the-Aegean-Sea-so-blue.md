While the famously blue and clear waters of the Mediterranean may be attractive, they’re not exactly a good thing - ecologically speaking. In abundance, phytoplankton (which form the base of the food chain in the oceans) can stain the surrounding water green. Look at this satellite image of a plankton bloom off France, for example:

In general, these massive blooms occur when local waters are rich in nutrients. If there’s too much nutrients, phytoplankton can experience huge population booms, in turn eating up all the oxygen and potentially causing an ecological disaster. This phenomenon is known as eutrophication.

The inverse - oligotrophication - has happened in the Med. It is only connected to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean by the Strait of Gibraltar - which is, at its deepest point, 900 metres deep. In other words, relatively shallow. Most nutrients occur in cold, deep waters, so they are barred from flowing into the inland sea.

Without much nutrients, there’s not much phytoplankton, and without much phytoplankton, there’s a very blue, clear sea.

Additionally, since phytoplankton are at the bottom of the underwater food chain, their absence means an absence of all the heterotrophic organisms which depend on them. The lack of plankton, I think, is best illustrated by maps like this:

This is a map of the world’s oceans showing the milligrams of chlorophyll per square metre, which in essence translates to the abundance of photosynthesizing life. Blue represents very little chlorophyll, and green a lot.

As you can see, the Mediterranean - especially the eastern part which includes the Aegean Sea - is as lacking in plankton as some of the most desolate parts of the open ocean. Of course, as some of you may have noticed, the above map raises some other questions. To answer them, we need to factor in the phenomenon of upwelling.

In essence, upwelling is when strong winds blow parallel to the coast, thus pushing the surface water offshore and allowing water from the deep to rise up and replace it. Because there’s no light in the deep, there’s no algae to eat up the nutrients, so cold, deep water is typically nutrient-rich.

In places like the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas, upwelling due to prevailing winds can counter the effect of being enclosed, creating areas rich in phytoplankton. Per unit area, the Black Sea has almost twice as many species than its larger neighbour. The Mediterranean has had no such luck, and remains a sea rich in beauty but lacking in biodiversity.
