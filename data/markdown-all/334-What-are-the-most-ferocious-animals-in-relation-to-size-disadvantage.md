The least weasel surely deserves a mention. It’s the smallest species in the entire order Carnivora, with some fully grown individuals weighing as little as 30 grams. An unassuming animal, by all accounts.

Despite this, they are incredibly voracious predators. Like many other mustelids, least weasels employ a very efficient, cat-like hunting strategy which usually involves delivering a quick, lethal bite to the prey’s nape. This allows them to dispatch (comparatively) huge victims.

In fact, there are reports of them killing rabbits up to ten times their size. That would be like a human wrestling a water buffalo or giraffe to death.

Size differences this drastic only happen occasionally; as far as I’m aware, there’s no good footage of such an interaction available online. The closest I could find was this clip of a least weasel versus a European rabbit.

(Warning: this video could be quite upsetting.)

Fascinatingly, stories of least weasels punching above their weight have found their way into the mythologies of several unrelated cultures. Pliny the Elder wrote that they were the only creatures which could kill the basilisk, while in the folklore of the Ojibwe, a First Nations people, they could slay wendigos by, well… crawling up their anus.

On that lovely note, I'll wrap up. Thanks everyone for reading!
