Hmm, that's a tricky one. A sure contender would be the long-tailed widowbird, Euplectes progne. This bird has a patchy distribution over sub-Saharan Africa, and I saw it in Kenya near [Lake Nakuru - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Nakuru "en.m.wikipedia.org").

Here he is:

The tail feathers of male widowbirds may be half a metre long, and the ridiculous tail in full makes up about 3/4 of the animal’s length. They also fly very unusually, in slow, erratic wingbeats just a few feet above the ground.

Another weird animal I've seen is Zonocerus elegans, also known as the elegant grasshopper:

This colorful orthopteran is widespread in Africa, and is also a pest as it eats local farmer's’ crops.
