As long as lions as a species aren't endangered, white lions aren't either.

White lions possess a genetic mutation known as leucism, which can occur in any generation from any population. Most lions contain at least part of the genes responsible for giving birth to a leucistic individual, so even if every white lion died, we could bring them back through selective breeding.

Thanks for asking!
