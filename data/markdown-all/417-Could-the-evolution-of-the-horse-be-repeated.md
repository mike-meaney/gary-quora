Not precisely, but a similar evolutionary path could be travelled. Indeed, you could say it already has.

This is Thoatherium.

It’s not a horse, in fact, it’s far removed from horses; belonging to a now-extinct order of South American ungulates called litopterns. However, it has long legs, and elongate snout, and, most remarkably of all, only one hoofed toe - just like a horse.

This is a prime example of convergent evolution. I wouldn’t be at all surprised if, millions of years in the future, vaguely equine mammals were to evolve.
