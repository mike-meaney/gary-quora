Birds are, according to modern phylogenetics, technically considered reptiles, and are warm-blooded. Their fellow dinosaurs were also likely endothermic too.

It’s been suggested by paleontologists that modern crocodilians are secondarily ectothermic and the archosaurs they descend from were also warm-blooded.

Pterosaurs had coats of “fur” (technically pycnofibres), and so were likely warm-blooded.

So were icthyosaurs, since they had blubber.

Also, we think that mosasaurs were endothermic too.

Lastly, the leatherback turtle is a “mesotherm”, its metabolism being sort of transitional between cold- and warm-blooded.

TL;DR: Yep.
