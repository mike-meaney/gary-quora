Well, I might as well add in my two cents…

*   Rainforests don’t have to be in the tropics. Very different from their equatorial cousins, so-called temperate rainforests can be found on every continent except Antarctica. My country, Ireland, is technically within this climate, but almost all of the rainforest has been cleared for agriculture.

*   Forest trees can essentially “make their own weather”. In the process of transpiration, they suck up moisture from the soil and release it into the atmosphere, where it can form clouds and bring rain. In fact, 15% of the atmosphere’s water comes from plant life. Deforestation will play a key role in the future Earth’s climate because of this fact.

*   Many trees are termed “pyrophiles”, which means that they only release their seeds in response to fire. For some pyrophilic trees, forest infernos rise up fireproof bark and melt the resin of their cones, releasing their seeds to fall to the ground and grow in a nutrient-rich, competition-free charred land.

*   One of the most interesting pyrophile trees are the eucalypts of Australia. Not only can they tolerate fire, they encourage it. The trees produce highly flammable oils, which can sometimes cultivate Biblical firestorms, eliminating all trace of competition for the next generation. Eucalyptus’ presence in Portugal was part of what made the country’s 2017 wildfires so infamous.

*   Endemic to Yemen’s Socotra archipelago (a biological wonderland in itself), the dragon blood tree is arguably one of the strangest-looking plants in the world. Shaped like an umbrella, they produce red sap called “dragon’s blood”. Their large, packed crown is an adaptation for the harshness of Socotra’s climate.

*   The world’s largest biome is the taiga, or boreal forest, which (interrupted only be the Bering Strait) is found in a continuous band covering an enormous 17 million kilometres squared. The northernmost extension of this vast forest is Lukunsky Grove, which is over 72 degrees north, less than 2,000 kilometres away from the North Pole.

*   The heaviest organism in the world is Pando, an individual plant which forms an entire forest by itself. It is a clonal colony of quaking aspen and is so enormous that it occupies an area of roughly 429,000 square metres and weighs a jaw-dropping 6,000,000 kilograms, making it over 30 times the size of a large blue whale (190,000 kilograms).

*   As recently as 5,000 years ago, the Sahara Desert was a moist land covered in savannahs, wetlands and forest. The remains of antelope, buffalo, hyenas and big cats have been found there, and rich animal life is depicted in ancient rock engravings. Theoretically, we could terraform the Sahara and make it green again, though it would be an extremely expensive endeavour.

There you go, a handful of facts about trees and forests which I find to be very interesting.
