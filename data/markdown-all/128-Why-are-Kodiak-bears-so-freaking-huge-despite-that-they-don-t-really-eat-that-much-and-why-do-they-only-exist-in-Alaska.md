## Why are Kodiak bears so freaking huge despite that they don't really eat that much, and why do they only exist in Alaska?

So, the Kodiak brown bear is a subspecies found only on the Kodiak Archipelago, a scattering of islands off the southern coast of Alaska. Out of the sixteen living varieties of brown bear, it is the largest - one captive individual was estimated to have weighed a mind-numbing 1,089 kilograms.

Wild Kodiak brown bears are typically closer to half that weight, however. Nevertheless, they still dwarf all other ursids (with the exception of the polar bear).

There are a handful of likely factors that have led to them evolving this massive size. First of all, one should consider Bergmann’s rule. This principle states that, generally, populations of an animal found in colder climates will have larger size. Up around 57 degrees north, Kodiak bears are closer to the poles than quite a lot of their close relatives.

As the mitochondria in each cell generate energy, some of that energy is shed as heat. The more cells you have, the more heat gets produced. Of course, insulating body fat also adds weight. So, having so much mass is quite helpful for keeping warm in Alaska’s subpolar climate.

Nutrition is also a major factor. From May through September each year, salmon of various species enter the rivers of Kodiak and its surrounding islands to spawn. The bears capitalize on this food source, which is extremely high in both protein and fat.

When the salmon run is not underway, Kodiak bears usually feed on plants, berries, invertebrates and the like, which are abundant. In fact, the islands’ ecosystem is so calorically dense that the bears there only range over as little as ~100 square km of territory, which overlaps with many other individuals. Large aggregations of them can often be found in the same place, with very little fighting over resources.

On the topic of diet, note that they spend part of the year hibernating in their dens. In the buildup to this period, they have to put on a lot of fat, so their maximum weight doesn’t necessarily reflect their weight year-round. In fact, they can increase their body mass by as much as 30% over the summer.

The last factor to consider is lack of competition. In most of their range, the brown bear coexists with the grey wolf, and both species feed on land mammals, salmon, berries and the like. Without a monopoly on local resources, an animal’s size can be restricted. However, Kodiak bears live on isolated islands, where there are no wolves.

So, in summary, Kodiak bears live in a cold climate where mass helps them stay warm, have a diet extremely rich in protein and fat, live in an environment where food is abundant, put on huge amounts of weight for short annual periods, and don’t have to compete with other large land predators for resources (except humans). That is why they’re so massive.

By the way, I certainly wouldn’t say they “don’t eat that much”. Like other bears they spend most of their time foraging, and towards the end of the summer they enter an extremely large caloric surplus. In any case, hopefully this answers your question, and thanks everyone for reading.
