Well, in a tiger census for the purposes of conservation, then usually no. Surprisingly little zoos actually put considerable money towards saving endangered wildlife, even when they may advertise doing so.

For those zoos that would willingly train and release their tigers for the wild (If there are any.), I suppose that they would count. Also, there are tigers in captive breeding programs that would be valid, as they will eventually be released into the wild.

If tigers became extinct in the wild, however, public pressure might force zoos into releasing their tigers (After sufficient training for hunting and survival), then they would count.

Basically, tiger censuses today are only really for preserving the tigers in the wild, so only tigers that are or will be released into the wilderness are valid.
