## Are African safaris really like as what's pictured in the film? You drive around a jungle in a jeep, and you are surrounded by lions, elephants, and other wild animals.

They’re not exactly as people imagine, but they’re still downright exhilarating.

One of the first things people don’t think of happens before you even leave your country: vaccinations. There are many diseases in Africa harmful to foreigners, and you’ll have to get a lot of needles stuck into your arm before you go. You also need to bring a few anti-malaria measures, like armbands that ward off mosquitoes and tablets you should take daily.

A lot of people also think that, when out in the savanna, you’ll be sleeping in some kind of tent or hammock with only your jeep, a machete and a few days’ rations. That’s also not true (Unless you really want to do it that way.). The lodges out there have free WiFi, all-you-can-eat buffets and rooms with four-poster beds. I suppose that’s one of the better surprises of an African safari…

When you’re out in your jeep in the savanna, you’re really not alone. I remember one day when I was on safari, there was a cheetah that had just brought down an antelope - under the scrutiny of about 100 jeeps. The vehicles went really close to where it was, and it was a) distressed and b) trapped in the ring of jeeps. By now, the number of cars was easily 200, and the cheetah was too stressed out to actually eat the hard-earned kill. Then, suddenly, the antelope got up and ran away - and the cheetah lost its dinner because a few hundred people wanted to get some nice photographs.

That was in the Masai Mara though, which is one of Africa’s most popular game reserves. There are some places you can go where you might only see one or two jeeps per drive - for example Tsavo West National Park a bit further north of the Mara - but they’re usually not as good. That incident with the cheetah was very unusual, however - usually you can get a good view of the animals once you find them.

One of the most common visions of African safaris depict jeeps rumbling over grassy plains with no roads in sight - this isn’t quite correct. In the national parks, if the rangers catch you off-roading, they’ll ban everyone from your guide’s safari company from visiting the park for 1 year. In the private game reserves like the Masai Mara, though, you only get fined a few dozen thousand shillings.

However, some people’s definition of “off-roading” might be satisfied by merely driving on the roads… in the reserves and parks, they can be really, really, really bumpy. Some big parks, like Kruger in South Africa, have paved roads, but most just have dirt trails. That brings me to another point - be careful with your phone/camera and your head, which often get banged against the side of the jeep while driving. Getting used to the voracious rattling of the vehicle is one of the harder parts of safaris.

Another common misconception is that you drive around yourself. You can do that, but seriously… don’t. Unless you’re a zoologist, you’ll get a way better experience if you hire a guide. Pro tip: Once you know which guide you’re assigned (The safari company will tell you before you leave), look him/her up on TripAdvisor. Some guides are better than others, and you can request another if they’ve got bad reviews.

While the guides often do have tribal heritage, they’re not “savages”, or anything close to that. Ours was an educated, reserved, polite young man who could answer any conceivable question you could ask him about the animals. Sometimes, people can be hesitant to engage with their guides at first, but after a while most get more comfortable with asking them questions. The jeeps are pretty hi-tech too - many have free WiFi and unlimited (ice-cold) water stored in a freezer.

In my opinion, the best surprise you get on your first safari is the extraordinary diversity life in Africa. You might expect lions, elephants and a giraffe or two, but there’s much, much more. Rhinos, hippos, crocodiles, zebras, monkeys, baboons, mongoose, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, jackals, about two dozen types of antelope, literally hundreds of exotic birds, and much, much more.

If you ever ever get the opportunity to go to Africa, I highly recommend it. Two weeks spent in Kenya or South Africa will make a hundred memories you’ll never forget.
