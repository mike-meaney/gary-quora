Ireland is pretty impoverished wildlife-wise, but I would have to say the common seal:

They even have the “banana pose” (assert dominance). Yes, that’s actually what it’s called.

Well, I mean look at them. They’ve got big eyes, round heads, and they always look they’re smiling for some reason.

We also have grey seals, which aren’t quite as cute because of their “Roman noses”, which are for display. On the land, there are red foxes and red squirrels which are also pretty cute.
