I'm answering this on my phone, so I can't write a long answer at the moment. Please excuse its short length.

Basically, that symbol is the staff of Aesculapius, the ancient Greek god of medicine. As to why it's a rod and a snake, nobody really knows.

However, there is one theory I've heard. Dracunculus is a type of parasitic nematode worm, and in ancient Greece, it was removed from patients by waiting till it emerged from an ulcerous blister, and then winding it around a stick.

Some hypothesize that the snake was originally a worm, and the symbol originated from this practice. Note that there are probably many more theories, this is just one I can recall.
