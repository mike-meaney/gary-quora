Fishing cats are fascinating. Their scientific name is Prionailurus viverrinus; “viverra” meaning “civet” in latin, which refers to the cats’ civet-like proportions. They’re found in Southeast Asia, are classified as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, and their numbers are declining sharply.

However, what’s most interesting about them are their aquatic affinities. They live exclusively in marshy lowland habitats; reed beds, swamps, tidal creeks and mangrove forests especially. About three-quarters of their diet is formed by fish - this, of course, is what gives them their name.

Hunting along the edge of watercourses, they use their powerful forelimbs to grab fish which stray too close to the bank. A “fishing dog” could never use such a strategy; the cat family is distinguished by its prehensile paws which are usually used to grapple with land-based prey.

There are plenty of other cool cats, but since you asked for a single species, I chose the fishing cat. In prehistory especially, there are some really weird felids - from ones with plantigrade feet, ones with serrated shark teeth, even to ones with huge “raptor claws” on their thumbs.
