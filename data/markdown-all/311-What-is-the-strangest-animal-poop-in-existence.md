Now this is a topic I didn’t expect to be writing on one day. I humbly suggest these examples.

The droppings of wombats are, in fact, cube-shaped. This is because the intestinal walls of the last portion of their digestive system have widely varying elasticities. The differences in stretchiness end up shaping the feces into cube shapes.

Believe it or not, this could be a useful revelation for manufacturing, as it allows cube-shaped objects to form without a mould or cutting instrument. Of course, one would wonder why this even came about in the first place. Since cubes can’t roll, wombats are actually able to stack their droppings, creating handy territorial landmarks.

The scat of the spotted hyena is unusual among mammals for being bright white. Contrary to the common misconception, spotted hyenas are not primarily scavengers but rather adept predators. However, they are in fierce competition with other carnivores such as lions, so they have adapted not to waste anything they can get.

As such, they are adept bone-crushers. Their powerful muscles, robust jaw and huge teeth mean that they can easily consume the bones of their prey. A lot of bones mean a lot of calcium, and when the calcium gets passed out it gives the droppings of hyenas their white colour. The unusual hue means that the territorial markings of spotted hyenas are very easy to spot.

There are also numerous mammals which consume their own feces; auto-coprophages, if you will. In addition to normal droppings, rabbits and their relatives produce soft pellets known as cecotropes. These form when food in the colon is forced back into the intestines, broken down into sugars by bacteria, and passed through the digestive system again.

Reingesting these cecotropes is essentially an alternative strategy to rumination (chewing the cud), which is used by cows and such. So, there you have it - if you thought bunnies were cute, I’m sure you’re now questioning this assumption somewhat. If you want me to ruin another adorable animal, capybaras also eat their own dung in order to collect bacteria which will help them break down the cellulose in plants.

Anyway, those are my picks for this question. I could have mentioned other examples, such as how there’s a prized Indonesian coffee made from the droppings of the Asian palm civet, or how vultures defecate on their feet to clean them, or how Adele penguins can fire their scat over a metre away using a high-pressure rectum…

Yeah, I should probably stop now. Thanks for reading! I hope you weren’t having dinner at the time.
