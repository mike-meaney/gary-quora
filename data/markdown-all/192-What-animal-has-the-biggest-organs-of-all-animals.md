It depends which organs you mean. Relative to body size, here are some record-holding species.

Eyes:

Tiny amphipod crustaceans in the family Hyperiidae. There’s very little information on these guys so I don’t know exactly how big their eyes are, but I do know they’re proportionally bigger than any other animals.

Stomach:

The black swallower, a type of deep sea fish. With its enormous, distensible belly, it can eat fish up to 10 times its size! Despite this, sometimes its eyes are bigger than its stomach (figuratively, of course), and it eats prey so big that it ruptures and dies.

Tail:

The aptly named long-tailed grass lizard, also known as the Asian grass lizard. Its tail is over three times longer than its body, and has the ability to regrow after being ripped off. It’s also prehensile, functioning as a fifth limb to grip branches.

Legs:

I deduced in a previous answer that this would have to be some kind of harvestman. Better known as daddy longlegs (not to be confused with daddy long-legs, a family of spiders), these arachnids are not actually venomous, contrary to popular belief.

Head:

I’m not entirely sure, but the erythrosuchids - an obscure family of Triassic reptiles - would be up there. Their huge heads were most exaggerated in the genus Erythrosuchus, whose skull comprised over a fifth of its body length, at more than a meter long.

Mouth:

At least relative to body size, I think the winner would be the pelican eel, another deep sea oddity. Its mouth is much larger than its body, and - like the black swallower’s stomach - is used to engulf bigger fish, hence its alternative name of gulper eel.

Beak:

The famous sword-billed hummingbird of South America. Its impressive beak is longer than its entire body (something that can’t be said of any other bird species) and is used for getting the nectar out of deep flowers inaccessible to other nectarivores.

Wings:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3ef5a284dd1b0217c60c26727c536ae9-lq)

Among extant species, it’s the wandering albatross, but the extinct Pelagornis sandersi beats it, with a 7.4 meter wingspan. The now-gone seabird family it belonged to, Pelagornithidae, is known for huge size and serrated, “toothed” beaks.

Tongue:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1efb19e880df5dd527fa6b053a87ca39-lq)

Unsurprisingly, chameleons hold this title, as their tongues are twice as long as their bodies. They shoot this out of their mouth with incredible speed (though [not as fast as another creature)](https://www.quora.com/Which-animal-has-the-fastest-tongue/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") to catch unsuspecting insects with an adhesive pad.

Brain:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-211d0cbf6e0412134deeaea537b83dc2-lq)

This title does not belong to humans (though we have the highest Encephalization Quotient, something different), but rather shrews, whose brains comprise 10% of their body mass. Their neural tissue is much less dense than ours, though.

Skin:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-35ab5d8647c4242f209c64180fa0c55a-lq)

There’s no official info on which animal has the highest ratio of skin to body mass, but I’d bet on the African elephant, because of all their wrinkles and folds (plus the huge, yet thin ears). Giant animals produce a lot of heat, so they need a lot of surface area.

Liver:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4efce87dc4944bc87b5f6ff9e4b88451-lq)

It’d definitely be some kind of fish that doesn’t have a swim bladder - perhaps a shark. Basking sharks, for example, have livers as big as cars which form a quarter of their mass. The liver is filled with dense oils which are used to control buoyancy.

Egg:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7b3e2a8644ae8d4dff70b4b5dc7a0875-lq)

I guess an egg is more of a cell than an organ, but it doesn’t really matter. In any case, it’s the kiwi of New Zealand - despite being chicken-sized, this bizarre bird’s egg is 10 times the size of a chicken egg, as vulnerable flightless chicks need to be well-developed at birth.

That’s about all I can think of for now. I hope you enjoyed reading about thirteen of the planet’s most oddly proportioned animals.

EDIT: Thanks to [Petter Häggholm](https://www.quora.com/profile/Petter-H%C3%A4ggholm "www.quora.com") for reminding me that the sperm whale has a much larger head than Erythrosuchus (roughly 1/3 of the body length).
