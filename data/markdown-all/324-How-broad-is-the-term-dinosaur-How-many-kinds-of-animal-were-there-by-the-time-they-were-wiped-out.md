When an impactor of some sort struck the Gulf of Mexico 66 million years ago, the dinosaurs were a very diverse group, although they had already been in decline for some time. These were the main types which were present on the Earth at the time:

*   Tyrannosaurs: These huge theropods were the apex predators in most of the Northern Hemisphere, with long, muscular legs and tiny, two-fingered arms. The largest and most well-known genus - Tyrannosaurus \- dwelt in North America, while in Asia you had Tarbosaurus and the long-snouted Qianzhousaurus, or “Pinocchio rex”. There are a couple of other tyrannosaurs and tyrannosaur relatives known from this time which are taxonomically questionable.

*   Abelisaurs: The southern counterparts to the tyrannosaurs. Found in South America, Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica, some notable species include the horned and speedy Carnotaurus, the cannibalistic Majungasaurus of Madagascar, and a couple of Indian carnivores such as Indosuchus and Rahiolisaurus. At this time, there was even one species in the north - Betasuchus, a pygmy species which is one of only two dinosaurs unearthed in the Netherlands.

*   Dromaeosaurs: A family of swift, feathered theropods, these lightweight hunters were closely related to birds, and distinguished by their nasty sickle claws. There are four species known from the end of the Mesozoic - in Asia, there was the famous Mongolian genus Velociraptor, while central China was home to Lenchuanraptor. Meanwhile in North America, Acheroraptor and the very large Dakotaraptor coexisted with T. rex.

(I should add that the dromaeosaur’s closest cousins, the troodontids, were also around, represented only by the Asian species Pectinosaurus and the disputed North American one Paronychus.)

*   Ornithomimosaurs: These were swift and rather lanky theropods, resembling long-armed ostriches in build, which actually ate considerable amounts of plant matter. Similar to the tyrannosaurs, dromaeosaurs and troodontids, by this time they were restricted to the Northern Hemisphere continents of North America and Asia. There was Ornithomimus and Struthiomimus on the former, and Qiupalong on the latter.

*   Oviraptorosaurians \- this group comprised medium-sized omnivorous theropods characterized by massive, short beaks similar to those of parrots, very few teeth, and sometimes bony crests on the head. At the end of the Cretaceous, China was rich in these, with Banji, Heyuannia, Jiangxisaurus, Yulong, Ghanzousaurus and Nankangia. In fact, only 2 species outside China is known from this age - Leptorhynchos, and the very large Anzu of North America.

*   Therizinosaurs \- the last theropod group on this list contained only one species at the time of the Chixculub impact, a living fossil in its time, but it was a very notable species indeed. Therizinosaurus was an elephant-sized beast with clawed forearms twice as long as a man is tall, the claws themselves being the largest of any animal, ever. It was, however, a herbivore, and the vicious scythes were probably used to pull down vegetation from trees.

That covers the theropods, as far as I know. Now onto the sauropods. These gigantic plant-eaters were, by this time, represented by one lonely (albeit diverse) group - the titanosaurs. Here are the main families.

*   Saltasaurids: 66 million years ago, there was only one species left in this group of armoured giants - Alamosaurus. By far the largest sauropod in its time - in fact, the largest ever saltasaurid - some estimates put it at 73,000 kilograms. This puts it at least in the running for the biggest land animal in Earth’s history. It coexisted with T. rex on the arid inland plains of North America and had bony armour.

*   Nemegtosaurids: This titanosaur family was similarly poor in species (some have hypothesized that sauropods were being outcompeted by giant hadrosaurs), with only two remaining at the end of the non-avian dinosaur’s reign. They were the Madagascan Rapetosaurus and the Romanian Magyarosaurus. Due to the fact that most of Europe was an archipelago of small islands, the latter species was one of the smallest sauropods - measuring only six metres in length.

There are a few other titanosaurs from this time that are taxonomically mysterious, and haven’t been assigned a family. As such, I’ll have to leave them out for now. Lastly, we have the ornithiscian dinosaurs.

*   Ankylosaurids: These armoured tanks of animals were some of the most interesting Cretaceous dinosaurs, covered in defensive bony plates - even on their eyelashes. At the end of the Mesozoic, you could find the largest and most famous species - the nine metre long, six-ton Ankylosaurus \- in North America. However, it is not known whether any other species in the family made it to the big extinction.

*   Nodosaurids: The closest cousins to the ankylosaurids, these herbivores were similarly armoured, but lacked their relatives’ distinctive tail club. Additionally, some of them had impressive spikes extending from their shoulders. They were considerably more diverse at this time, with several species - Denversaurus and Glyptodonpelta in North America, Struthiosaurus in what’s now Romania, and Brachypodosaurus on the then-island of India.

*   Ceratopsids: One of the most iconic and successful groups at the end of the Cretaceous, the ceratopsids were characterized by horns and spikes on their head and a bony frill protecting their neck. The second-largest and most famous species is Triceratops horridus, which shared North America with many other ceratopsids - Torosaurus, Nedoceratops and Augathamas among them. There was only one species outside this continent - the Chinese Sinoceratops.

*   Leptoceratopsids: The smaller and more primitive cousins to the bulky ceratopsids, these guys were almost extinct at the time of the K-Pg Extinction Event. However, there is one species we know of - Leptoceratops itself. It was about 2 metres long, roughly the size of a sheep, and evidently ate low-growing vegetation such as flowers and ferns. Interestingly enough, studies of the wear patterns on its teeth show that it chewed in a mammal-like fashion.

*   Hadrosaurs: This is an exceptionally diverse group of dinosaurs which were really in their heyday when the asteroid struck. Their most notable feature was their flattened, duck-like bills, which were armed with hundreds of tiny teeth for chewing tough vegetation. There were over two dozen species from this time, distributed across North America, the islands of Europe, and eastern Asia. The largest was Edmontosaurus, which was 13 metres long.

*   Rhabdodonts: Distant relatives of the hadrosaurs, these ornithopods were generally smaller - ranging between 1.6 and 6 metres in length - and had different teeth. There were a few species to be found in Europe in this time period - namely Rhabdodon, Pareisactus and Zalmoxes. Their dwarf stature was well-suited to the small islands which they inhabited, where they would have been dwarfed by giant pterosaurs.

*   Pachycephalosaurs: This last category is the sister group to the horned ceratopsians, as they together form the clade Marginocephalia. Instantly recognizable, pachycephalosaurs walked on two legs and had domed heads, often with knobbles or spikes. These could well have been used for intraspecific combat. At the end of the Mesozoic, four (possibly less) species roamed North America - Pachycephalosaurus, Sphaerotholus, and 2 disputed species.

And that’s not even to mention all the birds which were around 66 million years ago, which are of course dinosaurs. In that sense, dinosaurs were never “wiped out”, but I know that you weren’t referring to birds.

For me, writing this highlighted that, when you look at a single point in time, dinosaurs aren’t quite as diverse as you might think. Of course, the fossil record can only show us so much. Thanks for reading, I hope you all enjoyed.
