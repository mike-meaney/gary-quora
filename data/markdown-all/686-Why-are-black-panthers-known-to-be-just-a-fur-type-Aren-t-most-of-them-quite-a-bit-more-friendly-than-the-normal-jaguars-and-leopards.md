## Why are black panthers known to be just a fur type? Aren't most of them quite a bit more friendly than the normal" jaguars and leopards?"

As far as I know, melanism is simply a recessive gene trait that causes the coat to be black. However, I did some extra research just to make sure.

A quick skim through [Wikipedia’s page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanism "en.wikipedia.org") on melanism said nothing regarding friendliness. Here is a quote taken from the section “In felines”:

“Melanism in leopards has been hypothesized to be causally associated with a selective advantage for ambush. Other theories are that genes for melanism in felines may provide resistance to viral infections, or a high-altitude adaptation, since black fur absorbs more heat.”

That’s all it says on the symptoms/causes of melanism. I looked on [Wikipedia’s page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_panther "en.wikipedia.org") for black panthers as well, and it didn’t say anything like that.

Then, I searched “Are black panthers friendlier” on Google, but most of the results were either about either the superhero film or the revolutionary black nationalist group.

You might also be interested in [Big Cat Rescue’s page](https://bigcatrescue.org/black-panthers/ "bigcatrescue.org") on black panthers. That’s all from me for now, but be sure to read some of the pages I linked if you think you could spot something I missed.
