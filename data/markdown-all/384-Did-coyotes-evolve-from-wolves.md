According to various authorities - including the prominent Xiaoming Wang and Richard Tedford - a linear evolutionary path can be drawn to trace coyote evolution. And, no, they did not evolve from wolves, at least if that’s referring to only the timber wolf.

All species in the Canis genus - including the coyote, Canis latrans \- are thought to have evolved from the earlier species Eucyon davisi, which is about 6 million years old. Eucyon was small and probably resembled coyotes in many respects.

Moving forward in time to 5 million years ago, an early member of Canis appears, a direct descendant of Eucyon davisi - Canis lepophagus. Meaning “hare-eating dog”, this species was larger than its ancestor and similar in size to modern coyotes.

It is proposed that Canis lepophagus is the immediate direct ancestor of the modern coyote, Canis latrans. The earliest fossils of this species we have are roughly 850,000 to 740,000 years old.

Everything is bigger and badder in the Pleistocene, and coyotes are no exception - the Pleistocene coyote, Canis latrans orcutti, was larger and more robust than extant ones, and was probably more carnivorous. It went extinct due to competition with the grey wolf.

In any case, the modern gracile morph, being less specialized, made it through to the present, and are doing quite well, as their numbers are on the rise. Perhaps with the disappearance of the grey wolf across so much of North America, killer coyotes will evolve again.
