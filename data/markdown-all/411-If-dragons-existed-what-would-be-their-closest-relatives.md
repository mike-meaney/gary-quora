Depends.

Do you mean this kind of dragon?

If that’s the case, I’d say it’s some kind of derived Scansoriopterygid. Scansoriopterygidae was a family of theropod dinosaurs which lived during the Late Jurassic, and had bizarre, bat-like wings.

Assumably, these dragons would’ve somehow made it past the end-Jurassic extinction, developing a generalistic diet in the Cretaceous and therefore surviving the K-Pg impact. After that, they grew to outsize proportions, and as a result of the gigantism lost their feathers in order to shed more heat.

Or do you mean this kind of dragon?

In that case, its closest relative would have to be some kind of fish, probably a Sarcopterygian. You see, the presence of both four legs and a pair of wings means that it originally had six limbs, so it can thus not be a tetrapod.

Instead, it could be a descendant of some lobe-finned fish with three pairs of fins that colonized the land and, by great coincidence, evolved a reptilian form. Sarcopterygians do, in fact, have six fins, they just didn’t chance upon a hexapodal design.

Then there’s this kind of dragon:

My first guess in this case would be that they’re descendants of some kind of basal snakes which kept their legs but retained the serpentine body shape, but that doesn’t make much evolutionary sense.

Modern snakes still do have the the genes for legs in them, and some have birth defects which cause them to be born with legs, so it’s entirely possible that they could re-emerge. On rough terrain studded with sharp objects, it’d be beneficial to lift the belly off the ground.
