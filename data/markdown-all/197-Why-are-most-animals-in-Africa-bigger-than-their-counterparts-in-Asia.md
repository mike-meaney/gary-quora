It’s debatable how much water that statement really holds. I assume you’re talking about megafauna specifically, so let’s see if it’s really true.

Biggest land animal \- Africa’s African savannah elephant (4,900 kg on average) beats Asia’s Asian elephant (4,150 kg on average)

Biggest land carnivore \- Asia wins with the polar bear (average 360 kg), slamming Africa’s lion (175 kg).

Biggest cat \- well… it depends. Certainly, Bengal and Siberian tigers are generally larger than African lions, but if you get a mean average of the weight range of the whole species, you end up with only 157 kg.

This is due to the fact that some varieties, such as those in the Sunda region, are much smaller than others, bringing down the average. Let’s call this one a draw.

Biggest rhino \- the square-lipped rhinoceros of Africa (averaging 2,000 kg) just about beats Asia’s Indian rhinoceros (1,900 kg).

Biggest bovine \- the Asian gaur (950 kg) is a clear winner, beating Africa’s Cape buffalo (590 kg) by a wide margin.

Biggest reptile \- going by average mass, the saltwater crocodile (450 kg) earns Asia a victory over Africa’s Nile crocodile (410 kg). However, using maximum size, the waters muddy - see the disclaimer at the end. In any case, I’m going with the saltie.

Biggest bird \- The common ostrich of Africa (104 kg) absolutely demolishes Asia’s largest bird, the mute swan (12 kg).

Biggest dog \- the gray wolf (43 kg) of Asia beats the African wild dog (36 kg).

Biggest antelope \- the world’s largest antelope, the giant eland (650 kg) of Africa, is much heavier on average than Asia’s bizarre nilgai (198 kg).

Largest deer \- Africa is far behind, with its 200 kg red deer being outsized not only by Asia’s moose (the median weight being 540 kg), but also its elk and sambar deer.

Largest snake \- a similar situation, where the African rock python (maximum 113 kg or less) is beaten by the Burmese python from Asia (max. 182 kg), as well as its reticulated python. I couldn’t find a reliable average weight here.

So, as you can see, there’s no real correlation between larger animals and Africa. From the categories I picked, Asian animals were actually larger in over 60% of cases, but of course with such a small sample there’s no point in focusing on the statistic.

In any case, there isn’t any size difference between African and Asian fauna which merits attention. One which perhaps does is that the animals of these two continents are generally larger than those of the other five, since there is a definite trend in that case.

DISCLAIMERS: First of all, the crocodile issue. As said, the average saltwater crocodile is bigger than the average Nile crocodile, by about 40 kilograms. However, the largest known saltie was about 1,075 kg, whereas the largest known Nile crocodile weighed in at 1,090. In this way, you could say that Nile crocodiles are bigger, but I don’t really think that reasoning makes much sense in this context.

Secondly, the birdies. While Africa definitely does beat Asia no matter what, the actual largest bird in Asia is somewhat debatable. Using the political definition of Asia, the Indonesian half of New Guinea is in the continent, where the 52 kg southern cassowary lives.

However, given that it’s east of the [Wallace Line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Line "en.wikipedia.org"), none of New Guinea is in Asia in a biogeographer’s eyes, and since this is an answer about biogeography, I’ve gone with the corresponding definition of Asia. Thus, the largest bird is the mute swan, not a cassowary.
