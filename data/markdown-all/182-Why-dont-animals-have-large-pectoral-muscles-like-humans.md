## Why don't animals have large pectoral muscles like humans?

I answered what was basically the same question two years ago, and despite it being my fourth most-viewed and sixth most-upvoted answer ever, I’m not really that happy with it. So, let’s revisit this topic, with a more well-rounded and logical approach.

The pectoral muscles are what we usually refer to as the chest. They consist of the deep pectoralis minor, which is irrelevant for our purposes, and the superficial pectoralis major, which can be further divided into a clavicular (upper) and sternal (lower) segment. This fan-shaped muscle has a handful of functions.

Firstly, it serves to adduct the arm, or, in other words, to bring it closer to the body, like in a hugging motion. Secondly, it flexes the arm, bringing it out in front. Lastly, it can internally rotate the arm, twisting it so that the palm faces forward.

The pectorals are often present in animals, too. Horses, for example, have a pectoralis ascendens, descendens and transversus. They adduct the forelegs and lift up the trunk, playing roles in galloping such as changes of direction and shock absorption.

So, getting to the question itself, we first have to ask do humans have well-developed pectorals in “nature”? And by nature, I mean the environments in which people have genetically adapted to; things like gym equipment and in-depth understanding of muscle growth are too recent to have influenced human evolution.

The answer to this question is, like so many others, “it depends”. Humans have adapted to a wide variety of different environments, and the result of that is that there are slight genetic variations in anatomy and physiology between ethnic groups.

If you look at West African people and their descendants:

Or Polynesians:

It’s clear that, on average, they tend to have more developed pectoral muscles than, say, San people from Southern Africa:

In environments where having excessive muscle mass will damage your survival prospects, the native people will inevitably be less muscular.

The San inhabit the Kalahari Desert, where food is far too scarce to sustain a bulging pair of Arnold pecs. Additionally, they rely on extraordinary cardio endurance to get their food, which would suffer if they had to carry around so much extra mass.

Overall, however, I would say this: modern physiques often have much bigger pectoral muscles than is “necessary”.

These days, there is a borderline obsession with chest training among men. It’s considered one of the most important muscle groups for aesthetics, especially in bodybuilding. This trend was more or less started by the bodybuilder Reg Park, a three-time Mr. Universe:

However, looking at more old-fashioned bodybuilders, like Eugen Sandow, it’s easy to spot that their pectorals are much, much less developed.

The same is true of most elite athletes. Strength of the quads, hamstrings, the back and shoulders are all extremely important in many sports, but, while the pecs play a role, they don’t need to be that big.

There comes a point where more chest mass isn’t going to do much for your throwing distance or punching force.

This holds up when you consider ancient physiques, too. Classical Greek sculptures had very large backs, glutes and triceps, but not very much muscle around the chest.

So, my main point is that, in “nature”, having big pectorals just isn’t that important, for both humans and animals. Most animals’ chest muscles follow the same pattern that those of typical fit people do - strong, defined, sure, but not engorged.

To sum it all up, I don’t think there’s much difference in chest development between the average athletic animal and the average athletic human, unless the latter is doing specific work to train the pectorals (taking “medicine” can help, of course).

Thanks for reading everyone! Hopefully Google’s targeted ads algorithm didn’t notice me searching for images of “muscular polynesian man” for this answer…
