Long story short, it’s unclear. By the way, I’m assuming that when you say feline, you mean cat, since in the taxonomic sense feline would only refer to cats of the subfamily Felinae.

The largest extant felid species is the tiger, Panthera tigris. The largest extant kind of tiger is the Siberian tiger, a variety of the Mainland Asian tiger Panthera tigris tigris. The largest Siberian tigers in the wild are about 350 kg, but in captivity, they can be bigger - up to 424 kilograms.

I don’t know if the 424 kg individual - the magnificent Jaipur - counts, as a modern tiger could never grow so large in natural circumstances. Such a rule might also rule out ligers; who hold the record for the largest individual (extant) cats.

Hercules is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest extant cat. A huge male liger, he’s a humbling 418.2 kilograms in weight, nearly five times the weight of an average adult human male. Ligers are not a species, and are not known to occur naturally - they are bred only in captivity.

Assuming ligers and captive tigers don’t count, it’s worth peering into the fossil record to see what it has to offer in terms of giant cats. The thing with prehistoric animals - except for very well-studied and/or well-preserved ones - is that it’s very tricky to estimate their weight using only a few bones. As such, all the following ancient cats have no one weight estimate, but lower and upper ones, and they could theoretically be anywhere on the spectrum.

You mentioned saber-toothed cats in your question details. There were indeed a number of massive sabertooth species. One commonly called the largest is Smilodon populator, a South American animal which may have encountered early native Americans. It’s been estimated at 220–400 kg.

Another species which may well be the largest cat is a personal favourite of mine, Amphimachairodus kabir. Hailing from the Miocene savannahs of Central Africa, this beastie’s weight estimates range from 350 (enormous by itself) to 490 kilograms! Imagine that… a cat the size of a polar bear.

The last saber-toothed contender is Xenosmilus hodsonae, a dark horse. I’ve sometimes called it the weirdest cat in history - what with its bear-like build, plantigrade feet, shark-like teeth etc., and its size is also nothing to be ashamed of. Estimates put it at about 250–400 kilograms.

Departing from machairodonts but staying within prehistory, here’s the American lion, Panthera atrox. Its upper weight estimate - 523 kilograms!! - is higher than that of any other felid in history. However, the upper one is not necessarily true, and it could range all the way down to 235 kg for males, which were larger than females.

P. atrox wasn’t the only species of lion which could be the largest ever cat. Meet the Mosbach lion, Panthera fossilis (It could alternatively be a subspecies of the modern lion), which - at an upper estimate of 400 kg - overlaps with the posited masses of the previous species. It was possibly ancestral to the cave lion, P. spelaea

The last lion I’ll be mentioning potentially could have rivaled the other species on this list, due to the fragmentary nature of its remains. Giant lions, also known as Natodomeri lions, were a population of modern lions which lived during the Pleistocene and surely coexisted with the first Homo sapiens. They could have been 350 kg, or even more, according to estimates. We don’t yet know.

I’m not done yet. Just one more, I promise. This is the Ngandong tiger, Panthera tigris soloensis. Fun fact - it coexisted with such icons as Homo erectus and Gigantopithecus. Anyway, a 2007 estimate placed this at a whopping 480 kilograms, which would make it the largest ever tiger and possibly the largest ever cat.

Do you get what I meant when I said it was unclear? I just gave you 9 species there… talk about a straight answer. Personally, I might bet on either Amphimachairodus or the American lion as the biggest, but who knows.
