There are several theories as to why intelligence evolves. I’m going to explain a few here, and how they are relevant to diet.

Social brain hypothesis \- the anthropologist Robin Dunmar proposed this one. He says that evolution is not a solution to ecological issues, but a way of surviving in large social groups.

There are two very broad, rough types of social group, ecologically speaking. One is a group of animals that stick together as an anti-predator measure, like a herd, shoal or flock. The other is a group of animals that chooses sociality to take down prey more effectively - for example, a pack, pride or clan.

These two kinds of groups function quite differently. In a herd, you really just need to know when to run, and intelligence is not required here - in general. But in hunting groups, at least in more “artful” predators (As in, not ones that just hack away at the nearest animal to them), you need to co-operate, communicate, make decisions effectively and share food with some kind of structure.

All these complex behaviors require a significant amount of processing power, so these kinds of groups, according to Dunbar, are where intelligence evolves.

Social exchange theory \- social exchange is when two groups of animals come together and exchange objects, resources, services or something else that benefits the other group.

So, you could see social exchange as sort of like “trading”, except represented in other, more subtle ways. The thing about this is that one group could cheat the other in a way that could cause them to come to harm.

If the victim group allows this to happen, social exchange is no longer beneficial to the species and it will cease to evolve. When that happens, it means that both groups lose out on the advantages it could bring.

Therefore, in a species with advanced social exchange, individuals need to be really good at detecting cheaters. And what does that require? Processing power. So we know that this could potentially allow intelligence to evolve, but what diet would they have?

This could potentially evolve in any of the three, but could be supported by the social brain hypothesis, so is possibly more likely to be meat-eating species.

Selection theory \- this model states that hunter-gathering animals do not need intelligence to hunt effectively. Instead, it says that intelligence could serve as an indicator of healthy genes, and thus represent fitness.

I’m telling you this just as food for thought, but I’m not going to write much about this theory, because of the first sentence I said about it. That was: “Hunter-gathering animals do not need intelligence to hunt effectively”. If this is true, then intelligence could evolve in herbivores, omnivores or carnivores, regardless of their diet.

Disease-resistance hypothesis \- again, this one is not diet-dependent, but gets you thinking none the less.

So, you may know that many severe cognitive impairments are caused by diseases. Therefore, someone with higher intelligence does not have such a disease and is thus, in theory, better at resisting disease.

Ecological dominance-social competition model \- this is the one I support and the one that is perhaps most relevant to your answer.

For some animals, including our ancestors, they have an ecological niche which promotes evolution driven by the need to dominate their environment. As said, our ancestors tried to do this, and over time, they did.

Millions of years ago, humans were increasingly dominant over the species in the ecosystem they inhabited, so the need for ecological domination decreased. However, they were performing this dominance, many believe, partially through sociality.

Now that they had gained mastery (to some degree) over their environment by living in social groups, our ancestors now needed to iron out their skills in sociality. To perfect their “social skills”, complex behaviors evolved.

And complex behaviors require intelligence. Intelligence is good for communicating complicated concepts, as it allows for larger and more specific language. An intelligent leader is better able to identify and resist potential overthrowers.

So, how is this linked to diet? Well, this one’s pretty obvious. It’s the ecological dominance model, and someone who achieves ecological dominance is an apex predator.

So, depending on which hypothesis you support (In my case, it’d be the last one.), the answer will either be “Any” or “Omnivore/carnivore”.

One thing to note is that omnivores can be apex predators too. Humans are not anatomically specialized for killing things, but we’re really, really good at it because of our intelligence. And since - with intelligence - few morphological or physiological specializations are required, the species’ evolution can focus on adaptability.

And with omnivory comes adaptability. The reason why there are so many vegans and vegetarians in humans (Aside from having the cognitive capacity to make such a decision) is because we’re not predominantly dependent on either meat or plants.

That’s useful in the wild, because if there’s a plague that kills half the plants, or some local prey species go extinct, it does not merit the extinction of the food source’s consumers.

For example, if you wiped out rabbits, the Iberian lynx would go extinct, because they more or less only eat rabbits. Do this on a larger scale and wipe out some grazing mammals in Africa, and the lions could well go extinct.

So, as a short answer: Probably not herbivores, but carnivores are fine and omnivores are ideal.
