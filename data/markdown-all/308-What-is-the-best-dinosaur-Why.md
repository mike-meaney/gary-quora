Originally answered: What is the coolest or most interesting dinosaur yet discovered?

Among the extinct, non-bird dinosaurs, I think there are five main contenders for this title, species and/or groups which are a cut above the rest in terms of uniqueness. First of all, we’ve got the wacky and wonderful Deinocheirus.

This Mongolian dinosaur lived 70 million years ago, in an environment that was likely quite similar to that of the modern Okavango Delta: a lush, sprawling wetland in the midst of an otherwise barren desert. It was a member of ornithomimosaurs; dinosaurs who were typically lean and speedy, built like ostriches. Deinocheirus, however, was far from that.

It was a jaw-dropping 11 metres in length, and its eight-foot long arms were tipped with claws bigger than kitchen knives. Fortunately for hopeful time travellers, however, it was a plant-eater. It had a massive hump on its back and a flattened, shovel-shaped bill. In short, Deinocheirus could be described as a cross between a T. rex, a camel, a sloth and a spoonbill.

It coexisted with numerous species of therizinosaurs, which definitely deserve a spot in this pantheon too. They lived mainly in Asia during the Late Cretaceous period, and were somewhat related to the iconic dromaeosaurs, which included species like Velociraptor. However, they were superficially very different from raptors, or any other animal for that matter.

Up to 10 metres in length, therizinosaurs were covered in feathers, had short beaks and long necks, and wielded the largest claws of any known animals ever to live, at up to a metre each. Again, they were thankfully herbivorous, probably living a similar leaf-eating lifestyle to the giant ground sloths of the Ice Age. The structures of their inner ears and forebrain were also unusually developed, perhaps indicating astute hearing, good balance, or even intelligence.

Among the closest cousins of the therizinosaurs were the equally odd alvarezsaurs. This is ironic, because anatomically they’re basically the complete opposite. They were dainty little guys, with some species measuring as little as 50 centimetres in length, and evolved around 86 million years ago, lasting up until the end of the Cretaceous.

Alvarezsaurs’ big stand-out features were their comically teeny tiny arms, which contained only one claw. They make Tyrannosaurus rex look like a veritable gibbon. Short they may have been, but they were extremely muscular, as was the pectoral area. This, in addition to their thin, tubular snouts, suggest that they were myrmecophages (predators of ants and termites), like anteaters or pangolins, and used their claws to dig into termite mounds.

Another dinosaur which had an extremely unique diet was Spinosaurus. You may be surprised to see it here, since it’s such a well-known species. In my opinion, Spinosaurus become so familiar that people have forgotten just how bizarre a beast it was. Paleontologists make shocking discoveries about it all the time, and there’s still much left to learn.

Roaming the wetlands of Cretaceous North Africa, it was possibly the largest terrestrial carnivore of all time, with length estimates ranging from 12 to 18 metres. It had the semi-aquatic, piscivorous lifestyle of a crocodile, humorously stubby hind-legs, a highly elongated torso, a long snout pockmarked with pressure receptors, a paddle-shaped tail, and of course a massive sail on its back. If that’s not weird, I don’t know what is.

Last but not least, let’s meet the scansoriopterygids. I can’t seem to stop writing about these guys - in fact, this is the sixth time they’ve popped up in one of my answers - but they are more than cool enough to deserve all the attention. So, I might as well describe them again. This family inhabited East Asia, during the late Jurassic.

Scansoriopterygids’ claim to fame is their wings, as I’m sure you’ve guessed. They were not feathered wings, like those of birds, but rather formed by membranes of skin (patagia), like those of bats. These wings could be used to glide, and maybe even to flap, through the ancient Asian forests. Of the four discovered species, the largest measured two feet in length, and was the nearest thing we have to a real-life dragon.

So there you have it - the five non-avian dinosaur lineages which I believe are the most unusual, unique, amusing and fascinating. You might have noticed that all but one of my examples lived in the Cretaceous period, the end of the dinosaur era. By then, dinosaurs had been around long enough to flourish into more diverse and specialized forms.

That really makes you wonder how many oddballs might have evolved had that asteroid not struck the Earth 65.5 million years ago, or indeed if us mammals have a more varied and wacky future ahead of us. Thank you for reading, have a great day.
