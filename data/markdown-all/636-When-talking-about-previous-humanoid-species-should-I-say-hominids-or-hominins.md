Depends how humanoid you mean. I would use the word “human” as a synonym of the genus Homo. Thus, H. erectus, H. neandertalensis, H. rhodesiensis and of course our new friend Homo luzonensis are human, but Australopithecus is not, nor is Drosophila melanogaster for that matter.

“Hominin” is a confusing term because it could be applied to two clades; Hominina and Hominini. Hominini contains “my humans” and australopithecines according to most scholars, but some include chimpanzees and bonobos. Those who do recognize a second clade within Hominini, Hominina, which contains the same members as the mainstream Hominini.

Hominidae refers to the great apes; humans, chimps, bonobos, gorillas, orangutans and all their extinct relatives. To make matters more confusing, Hominidae fits into the larger clade Hominoidea, which also contains the gibbons or Hylobatidae and stem-apes.

Human classification is more complicated than you might think…
