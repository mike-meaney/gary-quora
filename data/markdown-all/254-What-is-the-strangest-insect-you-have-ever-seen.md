In the wild? It’d have to be this stunning grasshopper which I spotted in Kenya a couple of years ago.

It’s a Zonocerus elegans, or elegant grasshopper, and it can be found all across the eastern swathe of sub-Saharan Africa, from the Cape region up towards the equator. Though it’s a beautiful species, it tends to be an agricultural pest which can damage local crops such as banana, coffee and cassava.

Z. elegans is also interesting because it sequesters various chemical compounds from the plants it eats and stores them in its body. These compounds are harmful to its predators when ingested, making the grasshopper poisonous. Some of them are actually similar to the psychoactive constituents of marijuana.

Once a year, males use their bright colours to attract females, and when they pair up they stay together for several weeks, mating many times. Their offspring start off as nymphs, but metamorphose into adults in the advent of heavy rainfall. They don’t form swarms like locusts, but it’s at this point that they become agricultural pests.

And that’s about everything I know about this particular species. It’s rather obscure, so there’s limited information on it available online. In fact, iNaturalist reports only one other sighting of this species anywhere in Kenya. Thanks for reading!
