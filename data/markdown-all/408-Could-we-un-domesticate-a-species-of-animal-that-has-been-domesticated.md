We could indeed - or we could just let nature do it. Feral populations of domestic animals will de-acclimatize from human presence and intervention and revert back to normal wild lives.

Feral cats are absolutely abundant, there are millions upon millions of them.

Feral dogs are less common, but do often occur. Of these, dingoes have perhaps changed most since escaping their domestic lifestyle.

Perhaps the most famously feral animal is the mustang of North America.

Interesting fact; when the city of Fukushima was evacuated after its famous nuclear accident, the area was reclaimed by cows which escaped from their pens unattended, living bathed in radiation.

There are even feral plants, and many types of them. Here, for example, is feral cannabis.

In a way, you could say that all of these animals (and plants) have been “un-domesticated”. Once tame, they are now effectively wild.
