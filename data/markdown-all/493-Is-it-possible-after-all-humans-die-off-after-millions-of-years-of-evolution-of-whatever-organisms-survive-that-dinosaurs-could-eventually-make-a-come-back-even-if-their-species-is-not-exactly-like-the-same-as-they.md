## Is it possible, after all humans die off, after millions of years of evolution of whatever organisms survive, that dinosaurs could eventually make a come back even if their species is not exactly like the same as they were billions of years ago?

Yes, although in billions of years the sun will have likely killed off any complex life. Very dinosaurian appearances have occurred before outside Dinosauria, most notably in the Triassic crocodile-line archosaurs.

Many crocodylomorphs, such as rauisuchians and Carnufex (pictured), were probably bipedal, just like theropods. The largest of these was Fasolasuchus, which was 10 metres long and an estimated 3 tons in weight.

Other Triassic suchians include aetosaurs, which were herbivorous. They had armour plating and looked very much like ankylosaurs.

Triopticus primus had a domed head for ramming competitors, just like a pachycephalosaur.

There was even a crocodile-line archosaur, Lotosaurus, which both had a ceratopsian-like beak and a Spinosaurus/Ouranosaurus-esque sail on its back.

So, the answer is yes, it is possible for non-dinosaurs to evolve dinosaur-like characteristics given the right circumstances.
