Megalodon!!! It is my favourite water dinosaur! They could still be out there somewhere!!

Only joking. In all seriousness, I think that thresher sharks, genus Alopias, are pretty cool. The first thing you notice about them, of course, is their long heterocercal or caudal fins, which may comprise one half of the total body length:

What’s even cooler is that they use it to slap shoals of small fish, stunning them so that they can be easily picked off.

I’d also like to mention the frustratingly elusive frilled shark, Chlamydoselachus anguineus. It’s one of only a handful of species in the order Hexanchiformes, which may date back to the Paleozoic.

Each tooth is long, flat, and has three rows of needle-like spikes. The frilled shark’s strange body plan has been likened to a sea serpent, and some zoologists even posit a giant relative - as of yet unknown to science - could be the origin of sea serpent myths.

Last of all, I’d like to mention the bonnethead shark, the hammerhead’s lesser-known relative:

It’s a lot smaller than the hammerhead, but it’s got a nice, rounded head, which gives it its name.

Females have that rounded cephalofoil like the one in the picture, but males have a large bulge on the front end of its head. They typically measure from 60–90 centimetres in length, but can grow to 1.5 metres long.
