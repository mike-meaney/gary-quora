## Are any rivers so wide that you can't see the opposite side?

It’s not universally agreed upon as to which river is the world’s widest. Some would say the Rio de la Plata, in South America. At its widest point, it’s a staggering 221 kilometres in width!

That means that if you were to stand on the waterfront of Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital (it’s the grey patch just to the left of where the muddy water meets the ocean) then you would only be able to see 1/40th of the estuary before the rest of its waters dipped below the horizon.

In other words, you would have to be around 3.8 kilometres above sea level on one side of the Plate for the opposite side to appear on the horizon. Keep in mind that this is a simplified calculation which assumes the Earth is perfectly spherical and ignores the fact that the atmosphere refracts light, but it’s a fair approximation.

So, if you hadn’t already picked this up, the Rio de La Plata is more than wide enough that you can only see a fraction of it from water level, let alone the opposite side.

There’s only one problem… not everyone thinks that it’s a river. Some geographers say it’s just an estuary, others a gulf, others still a sea. According to those people, a different South American river is the world’s widest; the Amazon.

So… how wide is the Amazon? If you thought there would be a simple answer, then something tells me you haven’t read many of my answers. It all depends on what you consider the Amazon river as opposed to the North Atlantic Ocean.

Some geographers measure the mouth of the Amazon 325 kilometres in width. Others just go by the main channel and maintain that it’s “only” 15 kilometres wide. The definition which seems the most logical to me, however, puts the breadth of the estuary as 180 kilometres.

Regardless of which river is widest, however, the answer to your question is an unequivocal yes.
