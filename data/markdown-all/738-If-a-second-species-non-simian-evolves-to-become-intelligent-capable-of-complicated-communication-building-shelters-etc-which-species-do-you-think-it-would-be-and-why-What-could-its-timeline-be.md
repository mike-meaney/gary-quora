## If a second species (non-simian) evolves to become intelligent (capable of complicated communication, building shelters, etc.), which species do you think it would be and why? What could its timeline be?

In a previous answer (See [Gary Meaney's answer to If humans were to become extinct, why won't there be any new species to replace us? Is it because intelligent life takes the longest to evolve?](https://www.quora.com/If-humans-were-to-become-extinct-why-wont-there-be-any-new-species-to-replace-us-Is-it-because-intelligent-life-takes-the-longest-to-evolve/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")), I defined a list of species which I proposed could form civilizations\* with only minimal to no changes to their cognitive abilities. The species fell into these categories; apes, Cetaceans, elephants, corvids, parrots, and Cephalopods. Here, I will discuss my musings on the nature of their potency for sapience and the nature of their hypothetical societies.

\*In my answer, I defined “civilization” as “a complex social community with a heavy emphasis on tool use, as well as territorial sociality and advanced, complicated communication.”

* * *

First of all, we have apes. Ultimately, I see virtually nothing impeding them building civilizations. It seems likely that they would take up orthostasis (bipedalism with the back vertical, like humans), to free up their hands for more effective tool use. Their diet is incredibly varied, as chimpanzees may feed on over 200 different food types, meaning that they can source food more easily to fuel a powerful brain.

What would they look like? Assuming that they’ll be staying in the forest and not moving out into savanna like we did, they won’t need to be good persistence hunters, and therefore will keep their thick hair (We lost most of ours because it helps us to not overheat on a long hunt through the open grassland). Nobody really knows why we have protruding noses, and since none of the theories seem to have a vast majority in favour, I’ll just say that they’ll keep their nostrils-on-face configuration.

Lastly, their society. That kind of thing depends on the species, so let’s look gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos. Gorillas are herbivores, though they are extremely muscled, have well-developed jaw muscles and long fangs. Gorillas are probably the most quadrupedal of all great apes, so the chances are that they would lose a lot of their apparent stockiness if they became orthostatic (All that bulk is hard to support on two legs). Changing from a herbivorous to omnivorous or carnivorous diet would be beneficial, and they certainly have many adaptations to make the switch quite swiftly.

Chimpanzees and bonobos form the genus Pan, and are anatomically very similar, but their cultures are radically different. Once a single population of chimpanzees, the Congo river formed and separated them. One group of chimpanzees ended up on the less bountiful north side of the river, while another ended up on the opposite bank, where resources were much more plentiful. As a result, chimpanzees are typically violent, dismembering their enemies, and bonobos are generally more peaceful and diplomatic (They’re still voracious predators though.).

If chimpanzees and bonobos were to convergently evolve civilizations, a very interesting scenario might ensue. One species would eventually develop the technology to cross the Congo river, and conflict would likely follow, especially if it was the bonobos on the chimpanzee side of the river. The only thing is - if this species is anything like humans, an intelligent race of bonobos would multiply and multiply and expand into new territories, and eventually resources would become something to compete for. The only solution I can think of off the top of my head is some kind of contraceptive plant that the bonobos eat to prevent them from exhausting resources.

Then we have Cetaceans. I think that intelligent Cetaceans would either be toothed whales or - maybe - humpbacks, which show very high indications of altruism. Now, what of their potential for sapience? They’re social, and contrary to what most people think, they do have a way to use tools - and it’s disgusting. I don’t want to repulse any of you, but the reproductive organs of male dolphins are prehensile and dexterous - the only reason that they don’t use them for tool use is that they don’t really need to.

What would they look like? Again, I know this is disgusting, but the males might evolve engorged reproductive organs in order to be able to use tools better, and they also might become non-retractile (They’re usually kept inside the body). This would render streamlining poorer, so they might take up a less pelagic lifestyle, inhabiting shallow water. Alternatively, they could re-colonize the land, making streamlining irrelevant and allowing them to make fire. Since they don’t have hindlegs, they would either re-evolve them (Legs in whales are atavisms - some are born with them), or use the end of their tail and their ex-flippers to walk, making them “tripeds” instead of quadrupeds or bipeds.

And, their society. Since, in a dolphin race, only the males would be able to use tools (Unless they pull a spotted hyena on it), the females might become aggressive in dominant in order to ensure that the males “serve” them where they cannot serve themselves. Killer whale pods are already vaguely matriarchal, so it seems plausible. They would, obviously, remain piscivorous, though they might take to hunting whales with their tools. Thrusting weapons like spears tend to work best in water, so if they were to somehow fashion them (Out of narwhal tusks? Coral? Driftwood?), they could take down larger prey. Again, if they were terrestrial, making spears wouldn’t be a problem.

* * *

Now, we have the birds. Parrots, while they do demonstrate exceptional intelligence, do not have any way of making tools with dexterity, so I’ll dismiss them for now. Crows, being passerines, have prehensile feet, which they can use quite effectively to fashion tools.

The only thing is, feet have to remain on the ground for any intensive tool-making/tool-use. When they’re crafting tools from sedges, corvids balance on one foot, but I doubt that’ll cut it for making spears, knives or other tools. The only way that they’d be able to use both feet would be if they were airborne, and flapping is quite energy intensive. It may be a bit sketchy, but I think that the only way that they could make tools with dexterity would be if they were soarers, like albatrosses; sailing at high-altitude on winds. Otherwise, nothing about their anatomy strikes me as being impeding to sapience.

As for society, there’s not many details I can tell given on their current situation. Their tools would have to be very rough-and-ready, if they were to make them on the wing; it seems plausible that they would bring resources with them and fly high, rapidly assembling the tool, and then perhaps lowering altitude to attack a prey item. Since they’ve got the brains and the skills, predation on megafauna is quite likely.

* * *

Okay, so let’s talk elephants. They and gorillas are the only herbivorous members of the list, as intelligence seems to favor omnivory and carnivory (See [Evolution of human intelligence - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence#Ecological_dominance-social_competition_model "en.wikipedia.org")), due to their higher energy intake and, in the case of the former, adaptability. Nevertheless, it’s certainly not a requirement, as elephants demonstrate. They are social, communicative, tool-using and may even contemplate their own existence, making them great candidates for sapience.

Not much needs to be changed with their morphology in order for them to build civilizations. In order to direct more energy to the brain, they might become smaller or lose their tails (If they could make insect repellent like Stone Age humans, the tail could atrophy, as a flyswatter would no longer be necessary). On the contrary, their bellies might appear bigger and more rotund in order to accomodate a larger gut for extracting nutrients out of their plant food.

Their society would be quite different to that of a carnivorous species. There would be less of a struggle for existence, but eating would take up a large amount of time (As a result, the ideas of breakfast, lunch and dinner would probably never arise). Once they could make tools, it would be much harder for lions and hyenas to kill their young (Or the adults - it’s been done before). If they lived in areas like the Kalahari, they would retain a migratory way of life, but they might build shelters to take refuge from the elements too.

* * *

Finally, we have Cephalopods. Most (non-zoologist) people consider these to be the ultimate candidates for future sapients, but personally I deem them the least likely of achieving human-level intelligence. There are a number of reasons for this. For one thing, they don’t breathe air, they have siphons instead. Ultimately, that kind of breathing just isn’t going to cut it for real, proper sapience. You need more oxygen to fuel a brain like ours.

Secondly, they have no learning phase - possibly the most important thing when it comes to being intelligent. The mother lays the eggs, doesn’t eat while she guards them, and then dies as they hatch. Therefore, they have no culture, and cannot pass on information - in other words, it’s pretty much impossible for them to form a civilization.

To deal with these problems, extreme evolutionary change would be required. There’s really no selective pressure for them to breathe air as they are, so they’d have to colonize the land first. The easiest way to do that is by way of freshwater - a problem for Cephalopods, as they are poor at balancing salts and ammonia in their bodies. For them to become terrestrial, monumental evolutionary feats would need to be accomplished.

Still, a cephalopod society would be fun to see. It seems plausible that they would communicate with pulsing color patterns rather than sound, especially if they were descended from cuttlefish. Fire, obviously, cannot be made underwater, but there are alternatives.

* * *

TL;DR: Intelligent primates would have an orthostatic (human-like) posture but retain their hair. If they were descended from gorillas, they would lose much of their muscle, and if they were descended from bonobos, they would probably lose their peaceful way of life.

Intelligent cetaceans would probably use prehensile reproductive organs to manipulate and make tools, and have a highly matriarchal society. They might begin to hunt larger prey, and it’s also possible that they would re-colonize the land as “tripeds”.

Intelligent crows would have to make tools on the wing, and might evolve much larger wings for soaring like an albatross. They could likely be able to hunt much larger prey items than grubs, and sapient parrots are unlikely to evolve.

Intelligent elephants would probably get smaller, more rotund, and lose unnecessary appendages in order to feed more energy to the brain. They’d still have to graze all day long, though it would be much harder for lions and hyenas to hunt them,

Intelligent cephalopods seem unlikely, since they do not breathe air, and therefore cannot get enough energy for a human-standard brain. If they were to become terrestrial, extreme evolutionary change would have to occur, and it’s hard to tell whether they would retain their intelligence throughout the changes.

* * *

Last but not least, which is the most likely to evolve civilization? Aside from simians, I’d say that corvids are our best shot. They can make impressively sophisticated tools, are adaptable and successful, and ultimately need the least anatomical and physiological modification to become sapient.

Thank you for reading, and I apologize for the length of the answer.
