It’s been a long time since I’ve seen so many stellar answers on one question, but I might as well add my two cents. Here are some of the most fascinating animal defense mechanisms I know of.

The hairy or wolverine frog, Trichobatrachus robustus, is amazing in a couple of ways. For one thing, the males have thin, hair-like filaments of skin which are used for collecting oxygen. Secondly, they use fractured toe bones as weapons. Yes, the frogs intentionally break the sharp bones of their toes so they stick out and can be used as claws.

The “claws” are only found on the hind feet, and are usually attached to a bony nodule by collagen. When the wolverine frog is grabbed or attacked, the collagen breaks and the sharp bones are deployed. This defense mechanism is virtually unique across the whole animal kingdom, though the Otton frog is vaguely similar.

Ever wonder why surgeonfish are so called? It’s because of the bony blades they have on the sides of their tail (the orange thing in the photo), which are reminiscent of surgical scalpels. When attacked, the tropical fish flick these spines outward, and retract them when danger has passed. Surgeonfish blades have been known to give humans deep wounds.

Despite the fish lacking any form of venom, a cut from a surgeonfish is allegedly “extremely painful” and usually penetrates deep. Nausea, aching muscles and anxiety are all documented consequences of said injuries.

During the Pleistocene epoch, Jamaica was home to a bird known as Xenicibis. One of only two flightless ibises in history, it had clubs on its wings. Its metacarpal bones were thick and heavy - so much so that some think Xenicibis would have walked like a quadruped - turning them into weapons with which they could fight conspecifics.

Xenicibis was just one of the bizarre birds which lived in the Pleistocene Caribbean - if the right question pops up, I must write an answer on the full avifauna of that time and place sometime soon.

Lastly, a more grotesque form of weaponry. The caterpillars of silver-spotted skipper moths use their own feces as a defense. In a technique known as ballistic defecation, the insects can fire their own poo an incredible 1.4 metres away. Technically, this is more like the countermeasures of an aircraft, drawing predators to the wrong place, but it’s still an anti-predator strategy so I feel it belongs here.

Adelie penguins are also able to expel liquefied feces half a meter away from them, but this is just so they can defecate without having to leave the warmth of their nests, and of course captive chimpanzees sometimes throw their poo when frustrated. However, these caterpillars are the only animal which uses feces as a defense.

So, those are four different obscure strategies which equally obscure animals use to ward off predators. I could continue, but I feel these few are enough for one answer - thanks for reading, hopefully this answered your question well.
