Short answer: Very different. When the last of the non-avian dinosaurs (because I know you don’t mean birds) were alive, about 66 million years ago, the Earth looked something like this:

Let’s talk general geography first. Australia and Antarctica were connected to each other, whereas the Americas were separated. The Earth was in one of its hottest-ever periods - the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum - and due to that, sea levels were over 250 metres higher than they are today.

India, at the time, was an island in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Here, there were some of the world’s first grasslands, such as that at Lameta. Roaming the Indian grasslands would have been titanosaurs like Isisaurus and Titanosaurus, as well as meat-eating abelisaurs such as Rajasaurus.

There was even a giant snake, Sanajeh, which lived a nest-plundering way of life, even feeding on sauropod eggs and possibly hatchlings. Its length isn’t known for sure, but is estimated at 3.5 metres.

To the west of India, there was Africa. Much of West Africa was clothed in brackish marshes, the vegetation of which eventually became the enormous coal deposits which Nigeria now exploits. Some parts of West Africa were underwater, part of a shallow inland sea. Here, you might bump into a carnivorous lizard 7 metres long…

Goronyosaurus nigeriensis, above, was an endemic inhabitant of this sea, a species of mosasaur. With very small eyes and a snout covered in sensory pits, it was well-adapted to the murky, shallow waters of the West African sea.

On the other side of the continent, there was an altogether different place - Madagascar. The island, at the time, was a seasonal, semi-arid land, and home to some fascinating creatures. Take, for example, the fauna of the Maevarano Formation.

Here, the top predator was Majungasaurus, a giant cannibalistic abelisaur. Also present were titanosaurs (e.g. Rapetosaurus), a bizarre fish-eating theropod (Masiakasaurus), a bird-like dromaeosaur (Rahonavis), the largest frog ever to live (Beelzebufo), and a giant snake for good measure - Madstoia madagascariensis.

Meanwhile, much of North Africa was submerged by the Tethys Ocean, which no longer exists today. As well as several species of mosasaur, the Tethys was inhabited by the bothremydids, an extinct family of turtles which colonized the oceans independently of modern sea turtles.

Just to the north, Europe was nearly unrecognizable. The high sea levels had turned the continent into a chain of subtropical islands. Here, dinosaurs underwent the process of insular dwarfism - that is, they evolved to be smaller due to more limited resources.

This created a topsy-turvy where sauropods the size of ponies were dwarfed by giant azdharchid pterosaurs, such as Hatzegopteryx. This was one of the largest ever flying animals, with a wingspan of about 11 metres. Other residents of the European islands included Gargantuavis and Balaur, some of the first flightless birds, and the crocodile relative Sabresuchus, which has a pretty damn badass name.

Over to the east, in Asia, the Gobi Desert had already appeared. This makes it the second-oldest desert in the world, after Southern Africa’s Namib. Our best fossil site from this oriental desert is the Nemegt Formation, which was once a fertile wetland, an oasis in the middle of the desert. Its closest modern equivalent would probably be the Okavango Delta in the Kalahari.

Nemegt was home to some of the weirdest dinosaurs, like Deinocheirus mirificus \- an unholy, T. rex\-sized beast with the head of a spoonbill, the hump of a camel, the claws of a sloth and the legs of an ostrich. Thankfully, it was just a wading plant-eater, but I still wouldn’t get too close to those scimitar-like claws.

Living alongside Deinocheirus in the mudflats, river channels and conifer forests of the Nemegt swamp were large theropods like Tarbosaurus (a close relative of Tyrannosaurus), Alioramus, and Therizinosaurus \- a herbivore with 30-inch claws - as well as sauropods, ornithomids, oviraptorosaurs and a huge pterosaur, nicknamed the “Mongol Giant”.

Now, we cross the Bering Land Bridge to arrive at the North American Arctic. While, in the Late Cretaceous, nowhere was iced over year-round, it certainly would have snowed in the winter. A good picture of what this chilly land would have looked like is given by the Prince Creek Formation, in northern Alaska.

Some notable inhabitants of Prince Creek are Nanuqsaurus, a small tyrannosaur named after the Inuit word for “polar bear”, Pachyrhinosaurus, a 3 tonne ceratopsian, and Alaskacephale, the state’s only pachycephalosaur. There was also the well-known Troodon, but the Arctic ones were 50% larger than their southerly cousins. This is because more mass produces more heat.

Following the young Rockies south, we reach a warmer North America - the home of this period’s most iconic dinosaurs. I’ll look at the famous Hell Creek Formation to give you an idea of this region’s ecosystem. Hell Creek was a forested coastal floodplain, of subtropical climate, and was dominated by cypress trees, gingkoes, and ferns.

Roaming the Creek were, of course, the favourites like Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Ankylosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus, Edmontosaurus, Ornithomimus and Dakotaraptor, who need no introduction. There were a bunch of other species of dinosaur, as well as numerous crocodile relatives, turtles, and lizards (such as Obamadon, named after Barack Obama, and Paleosaniwa, which was 3.5 metres long!).

We pass through the rest of North America (and, to answer your question, the Grand Canyon could have existed by this time, though it wouldn’t have been much to look at) and over the Gulf of Mexico, where the Chixculub asteroid struck, to reach the island continent of South America.

South America is unusually poor in fossil sites from this time, but the Allen Formation of Argentina is fairly rich.

Some of its most famous dinosaurs are Saltasaurus, a sauropod armoured with bony plates, and Austroraptor, one of the largest-ever dromaeosaurs. The former is pictured above, being hunted by Quilmesaurus - a type of abelisaur. These two species were Allen’s top predators, preying on ornithopods and perhaps young titanosaurs, too.

Soaring above them was Aerotitan, an azdharchid with a 9-metre wingspan. This made it one of the largest ever flying animals, and certainly South America’s largest. Off the Argentine coast, you could find a few types of plesiosaur, such as Aristonectes.

Last but not least, we’ll take a look at Antarctica, which was still connected to Australia by this time. Our case study locale will be what’s now Ross Island, on the Antarctic Peninsula. During the balmy Late Cretaceous, the great southern continent was largely green, much less barren than its frigid modern counterpart.

In the ferny coniferous forests, there would have been ankylosaurs like Antarctosaurus, as well as the small ornithopods Morrosaurus and Trinisaurus. There was a feathery theropod - Imperobator, pictured \- and even titanosaurs. The then-temperate Southern Ocean would have harboured mosasaurs, elasmosaurs, sharks and ammonites.

And that’s been my tour of the world, just before the Mesozoic Era ended and the non-avian dinosaurs were wiped out. It might seem lengthy, but I’ve actually had to gloss over quite a lot. I might expand it later. Anyways, thanks for reading!
