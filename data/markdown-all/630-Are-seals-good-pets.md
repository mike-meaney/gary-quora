The most challenging part about having a pet seal would be the immense cost of having one.

Getting a seal:

Never, ever, ever abduct a seal from the wild. Wild seals are highly social animals, and tearing one away from its colony would make it extremely stressed in captivity.

I suggest you either adopt an orphaned pup or you accquire one from a captive breeding program. This would require many meetings, paperwork and haggling, I imagine.

Requirements:

If you were really rich, had a large swimming pool that you’re willing to give up, and a constant source of fish, it would at least be reasonable to consider it. In captivity, a seal needs:

*   A large area to swim around
*   Sunlit land to rest on
*   Lots of fish
*   Company

So, let’s focus on the first point first. Seals need to have plenty of space to swim, so you’d need to have quite a large swimming pool in your back garden. I’d say - unless you want animal welfare groups knocking on your door - you’d need a pool around 50 metres long and a good few metres deep.

The second point isn’t as costly as the first. Seals require haul-out areas to rest and bask in the sun. Seals spend a lot of time sleeping, and your haul-out area should ideally be sunlit and warm.

Then you need fish. An adult common seal needs about three and a half kilograms of fish a day, which is quite a lot if you plan to keep this seal in the long term. You would need to have some sort of fairly-nearby supplier of large quantities of fish. It’s also a good idea to feed them on a regular, structured timetable.

Now for the last one - company. This is where things get really expensive. Your pet seal needs to be able to behave very similar to how it would in the wild, aside from being accustomed from humans. You’ll be in serious trouble with authorities unless you comply with this, so you’ll need to keep your seals in a group.

In the wild, seals live in large social groups called colonies. To make the seals feel safe, you would need to keep about ten. Yes, ten. I hope you’re really rich, ‘cos these seals are gonna cost you.

Benefits:

Seals, like many carnivorans, are very intelligent, and highly trainable. I’d say you’d probably be able to - with the help of an animal behaviorist - train it to obey a number of voice commands.

In the UK, you don’t need a licence to keep a common or grey seal. Their conservation status is Least Concern, so they’re not threatened, and they are indigenous to the country.

People love seals. To avoid getting attention from the Seal Conservation Society or another pinniped conservation organization, I suggest that you charge people to come and look at your seal (From a distance, causing no distress to the animal), and then donate that money to seal conservation. The Seal Conservation Society has stated that, and this is a paraphrasing, “the benefits to the animal as a species must justify the animal’s confinement”, so this tactic would be a way to comply with this guideline.

Drawbacks:

The biggest drawback, by far, is the money. You need to have the money to buy all the seals, feed them everyday, change the water, pay for their healthcare, and a myriad of other costly things.

Expect a lot of attention from animal welfare groups. Even if you complied with all the guidelines above, there’s still a chance that they’d come over, inspect the seals and their enclosure, and decide that they’re too stressed. That would result in the seals being taken off you, and a hefty fine.

Seals in captivity are more prone to disease than in the wild. You’d need to be really careful when making their enclosure that its devoid of harmful bacteria or viruses, and there’s always the added risk of disease transferral from human contact.

Conclusion:

If you’re filthy rich, dedicated, determined and really good at negotiating, it’s possible. Your seals would behave kind of like large dogs that prefer water to land. If you have all the requirements for this, then, by all means go ahead, but expect a rocky road.
