Most animals are probably quite dull, since most animals are insects. Of the three main systems of the brain (the cerebellum, limbic system and prefrontal cortex), they have only the first, and the cerebellum is an organ which concerns, for the most part, instinctual reactions and that. (That’s why spiders can use UV webs to attract flies).

However, I would also say that a select few groups and species of animals which are extremely intelligent, nearly the way there to ours. In fact, I’d say several deserve the title of being fully sapient (although it is difficult to use that term without being anthropomorphic.

I’ve written before on the intelligence of elephants.

> . . . Just look at elephants, . . . Their intelligence is well-documented, and I'd even go so far as to say that the main difference between them and us is our capacity for language.

> Consider the following facts:

> *   Their brains, which are five kilograms in weight, have more cortical gyres than any primate or cetacean. Their brain-to-body mass ratio is up there with great apes and dolphins.
> *   They have highly complex social systems based around the knowledge and experience of a single leader, the matriarch.
> *   They are more than capable of differentiating between herds - in fact, a matriarch will instantly recognize a rival from another herd and react accordingly. They can even differentiate between different human cultures.
> *   They are one of the only animals which have funeral rites. They bury their dead and the dead of other animals with fruit, flowers and leaves (grave goods?)
> *   They even display some parallels with human religion, ritualistically waving branches at the waxing moon and bathing when it's full.
> *   They use tools all the time, making fly swatters out of sticks, covering over pools of water to prevent evaporation, and dropping logs on electric fences to disable them.
> *   Pregnant elephants have been seen chewing special leaves which local humans use to induce labor and miscarriage.
> *   They can recognize themselves in the mirror - I get that this is an imperfect test for consciousness, but it is at least an indicator of high intelligence.
> *   They seem to have artistic inclinations, as many zoo elephants paint actual pictures and images.

> And all this without a shred of meat, or even decently nutritious plants for that matter. I'm not suggesting that elephants are as intelligent as humans, but they're - in the grand scheme of things - pretty bloody close. I can foresee no barrier between their intelligence and ours which herbivores could not cross.

See also my musings on the intellect of dolphins, with their incredible social behaviors and surprising capacity for emotion.

> Well, let’s have a look at the facts. Dolphins, among other things:

> *   have an EQ equivalent to archaic species of Homo
> *   are extremely social and form cohesive units
> *   maintain stable close bonds with pod-mates for years
> *   use tools such as medicinal corals, narcotic pufferfish secretions, and… [dead fish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkA4Mij2RFo "www.youtube.com") (note: potentially NSFW)
> *   hunt cooperatively with conspecifics and even other species, including false killer whales and humans
> *   have culture that can be passed down and evolve; different populations of orca have regional dialects of language and different hunting techniques
> *   are highly altruistic and have attempted to save humans from shark attacks and beached whales
> *   possess extremely complex communication skills
> *   are self-aware, at least according to mirror tests

> All this evidence makes dolphins - particularly the various bottlenose species and orcas - very, very high candidates for the most intelligent kind of animal, even more so than chimpanzees. I think that humans experience a kind of bias to chimpanzees, bonobos and other great apes because their facial expressions are easy to read and they use tools a lot.

> However, while apes do display an extraordinarily complex intelligence, we must remember that animals behave according to their psychological framework, as defined [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_cognition#Biological_constraints "en.wikipedia.org"). Because of its evolutionary heredity, a hedgehog will roll into a ball when threatened, not run away. Does this mean they have poor learning skills? No, they simply act differently because they are different. Similarly, manta rays are known to be self-aware, but are terrible at problem solving due to their anatomy.

Lastly, for a general essay on the evidence of intelligence in several other kinds of super-smart animals, see my lengthy answer here; [Gary Meaney's answer to If humans were to become extinct, why won't there be any new species to replace us? Is it because intelligent life takes the longest to evolve?](https://www.quora.com/If-humans-were-to-become-extinct-why-wont-there-be-any-new-species-to-replace-us-Is-it-because-intelligent-life-takes-the-longest-to-evolve/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")

In short, I’ve written fairly exhaustively on this subject before (hence the linked answers), and I’ve decided that yes. Some animals are extremely smart. It is the belief of myself and many other scientists that it is language, not necessarily “intelligence however we may see it, which is the key difference between us and them.
