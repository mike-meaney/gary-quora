From a practical point of view, a domesticated spotted hyena would be both amazing and \*relatively\* easy to take care of, at least compared to other animals.

They’re ecologically very similar to wolves, but more intelligent and more social. Since wolves have been domesticated with great success, I imagine that domesticating spotted hyenas would give equally great, or quite possibly better, results. I discuss this more here: [Gary Meaney's answer to What animals can mankind domesticate but hasn't yet?](https://www.quora.com/What-animals-can-mankind-domesticate-but-hasnt-yet/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")

Anyway, they’re beautiful, loyal (according to historical accounts of tamed hyenas), and selective breeding could do wonderful things with their coat.

Other social canids, such as dholes and African wild dogs, again being quite ecologically similar to wolves, would probably have the same characteristics of domestic dogs, so I’d buy one any day.

Now, departing from the realms of what would be practical to take care of, I’d really like to have a pet seal, provided it was domesticated and not taken from the wild. I’d need either a huge swimming pool or to live by the sea, and I’d end up broke buying fish, but let’s imagine I’m a millionaire with a swimming pool.

Seals look beautiful, have really plush fur, and make funny screaming noises. That’s enough qualification on it’s own for them to be the best pets in the world.
