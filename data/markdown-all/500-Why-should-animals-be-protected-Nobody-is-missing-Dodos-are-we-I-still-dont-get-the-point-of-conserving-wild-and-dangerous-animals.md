## Why should animals be protected? Nobody is missing Dodos, are we? I still don't get the point of conserving wild and dangerous animals.

Dodos are just the stereotypical “species wiped out by humans”, but most people don’t realize how drastically we have altered this planet, and that it will never be the same again. Extinction is a natural process, but we’ve accelerated it by at least 1,000 times, quite possibly 10,000. Thousands of species have already been wiped out by humans.

What you don’t seem to understand, If I may be frank, is that ecosystems require balance for other species - any species - to survive. A famous examples are the wolves of Yellowstone. Once, grey wolves ranged across the entirety of the continental United States, but until about 30 years ago, humans extinguished them from all 3 million square miles of it.

In Yellowstone, the absence of wolves was having consequences. Deer populations exploded with far fewer predators to keep them in check, and loads of small trees were clipped to knee-height by their browsing. When wolves were re-introduced, their populations went back into their natural state, the trees got a chance to grow back, providing wood for beavers, nesting sites for birds and habitats for millions of insects. Those are all things that other species require to stay alive.

I guess, by the looks of your question, the total decimation of animal species doesn’t mean anything to you. But remember, humans are a species too, and humans require stable ecosystems just like any other species.

The extinction of bees alone - just one taxonomic family - would make a third of our crops fail, wipe out 80% of plant species, turn all grasslands to deserts and decimate cow, sheep, chicken and horse populations. In short, the extinction of bees would probably spell our doom.

You can only make so much impact on an ecosystem before it all collapses and takes you with it.

To put it another way, why should people be protected? Billions of people have died already, and we’re still fine.

Obviously, I don’t mean that, I’m just trying to put it in the starker, more striking kind of context that’s the only thing that works on people who don’t care about other animals. If world leaders and government members didn’t have security, they’d be assassinated, and nations would collapse.

Upon reading my question, the first thing you’ll say is that “But I’m a person too”. And what I say to your question is;

We’re animals too.
