Ooh, I’m glad I came across this question. I happen to have a soft spot for caterpillars; they’re among my favourite arthropods, and they’re a lot cooler than you think. I know I say that in practically every answer I write, but it’s true. Here we go, then.

*   Hickory horned devil: This 15-centimeter giant is probably the largest caterpillar in the world. Easily one of the weirdest insects in the contiguous US, its vivid colours and elaborate spikes give it a fearsome appearance, despite it being totally harmless. It metamorphoses into an attractive orange, grey and white moth.

*   Amphibious caterpillars: These 12 species (which, as of yet, have no Latin names) are endemic to Hawaii. They are the only insects which are truly amphibious, and can survive underwater longer than any other air-breathing animal - up to a month! They do this using respiratory pores in their skin and actually require flowing water to breathe.

*   Carnivorous caterpillars: Another Hawaiian endemic, these 3 species in the diverse moth genus Eupithecia are unique for their predatory habits. They lie motionless in wait, mimicking twigs or stems, until an insect flies by, which they snatch using the terrible hooked claws on their forelimbs. Scaled up, these would be terrifying predators.

*   Snail-eating caterpillar: Like the previous creature, this one is both carnivorous and only found in Hawaii. They feed only on land snails, catching them using nets of silk. They then crawl inside the snail’s shell and eat it alive, from the inside out. And get this - they decorate their bodies with their victim’s shells, likely for camouflage reasons.

*   Slug caterpillars: The larvae of this family (Limacodidae) are so named for their slug-like appearance. They’re rotund and gelatinous, and have suckers, rather than legs, on their undersides. They move via rhythmic rippling of their belly and a kind of liquefied silk which functions as a lubricant.

*   Spun glass caterpillar: While it is in the slug caterpillar family, I had to give this one a separate bullet because it’s so incredibly beautiful. Looking like a handcrafted glass ornament, it’s covered in transparent crystalline barbs which can give you severe dermatitis if touched. They’re mainly found on the East Coast of the USA and feed on oak leaves.

*   Jewel caterpillars: This family of moths, Dalceridae, is often confused with the slug caterpillars, as the larvae of both families are gelatinous in appearance. They’re covered in jelly-like mucus, and when predators - like ants - try to attack, they get stuck in this goop and starve. You should also look up an adult jewel caterpillar moth - they’re beautiful too.

*   Flannel moth caterpillars: These caterpillars are instantly recognizable, as they’re covered in a coat of long fur (which is actually venomous setae, so don’t touch one), which can be yellow, brown, white, or even curly. One species, found in Peru, looks remarkably like Donald Trump’s hair, which has gained it Internet fame.

*   Hag moth caterpillar: It’s easy to see why this critter is nicknamed monkey slug, what with its brown furry appearance and limb-like appendages. These “arms”, of which there are six, are able to detach and regrow without any harm to the caterpillar. While some people report no symptoms, others may experience irritation after touching its tufts of setae.

And that’s all I’ve got, for now anyway. While we’re here, here’s a fun fact about caterpillars - they turn into butterflies, right? Wrong. Well, mostly - about 90% of the caterpillars there are, and probably an even higher percentage of those you’ve encountered, metamorphose into moths, not butterflies. Anyway, thanks for reading.
