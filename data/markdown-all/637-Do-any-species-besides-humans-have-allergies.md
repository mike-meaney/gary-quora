Allergies are caused by a mistake on the part of the immune system, and I very much doubt that any species’ immune system is without such fault. So, presumably any animal with an immune system would be vulnerable to allergies. From Wikipedia:

> It is likely that a multicomponent, adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates, as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response

So, from that fact I can conclude that all vertebrate species can presumably have allergies.

To check this conclusion, I tried to find some evidence of pet fish getting allergies. There were people who suspected their fish had something similar and asked on places like Reddit (and numerous answerers actually reached the same conclusion as me, that anything with an immune system can have allergies), but ultimately the answers largely were that it’s not documented enough.

However, one thing I would say is that it’s probably very rare in the wild, just like it is with humans, especially those in tribal societies, who spend most of their time outdoors. The main reason we, dogs and cats and have allergies is that we don’t expose ourselves to the “real world” enough.
