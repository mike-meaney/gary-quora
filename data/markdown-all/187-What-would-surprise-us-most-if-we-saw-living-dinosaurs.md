Many things.

Feathers are an obvious one. Although it’s well known among paleontology fans that dinosaurs were feathered, the average layman would still be surprised to see, say, a tyrannosaur clad in feathers all over.

Although, the extravagance of the feathers is something that would surely surprise even the paleofans. Just look at birds - ocellated turkeys, birds of paradise - who’s to say that other dinosaurs didn’t have such flamboyance too?

There might even be feathers on dinosaurs even the majority of paleontologists would have thought of as non-feathered. It’s likely that many ceratopsians had quills (And thanks to the recent pterosaur discovery we know that they were likely true feathers and not modified scales), but perhaps those living in cold climates had full fur coats?

Feathers are something that rarely fossilize, although the same cannot be said of giveaway quill-knobs. There are other soft-tissue structures which we can’t often tell are present. Birds display myriad kinds of wattles and fleshy display features - think turkeys, chickens, frigate birds and marabou storks.

If birds are anything to go on, it’s entirely possible if not likely that non-avian dinosaurs had them too. Sauropods, especially, might have had dewlaps (like modern eland), as shedding heat would be crucial for such titanic animals. Take a look at some of these speculative structures.

Loads of “with it” paleoartists nowadays are reconstructing sauropods and sometimes ankylosaurs with inflatable “balloons” on their noses, like hooded seals. In some cases, there is even (what could be interpreted as) osteological evidence for this.

Now, after dealing with appearances, onto surprising behaviors. With birds as our only modern guides, it’s parsimonious to at least consider that non-avian dinosaurs behaved in some bird-like ways. Perhaps they enjoyed dust baths.

Or competed in “leks” for mates.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7b47a3879c89ab73e921e73a9b3e6a76-lq)

Or participated in complex courtship rituals, no doubt aided by fabulous display.

This courtship may have even involved the assembly of “bowers” and the collection of trinkets, like modern bower birds.

On a darker note, maybe (as in the case of ducks) their copulation would have been extremely unpleasant for the female.

This drawing I like, showing a large Majungasaurus as a fossorial (burrowing) creature. It looks, initially, surprising, but the artist explains it well with evidences overall hinting at adaptations for digging.

Some more creative paleoart illustrations, put here so as not to clog up the main answer:

(Speculative foul-smelling secretion being expelled from a heterodontosaur’s anal glands)

All of these seem at least mildly unusual at first - and some of them, like the frigate bird dinos seem extremely surprising. However, they’re consistent with the fossil evidence, and indeed they could be seen as evidenced themselves, as they often draw from things observed in birds.

At the end of the day, unless we discover some truly miraculous fossils, we’ll never really know the truth. In some ways that’s sad, but in others exciting. The best we can do for now is to keep speculating.
