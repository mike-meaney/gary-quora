A good question, and not one that the layman might conceive. Technically, all Afroinsectiphilians are carnivorous, since they’re insectivorous, but I get what you mean - why are there no macroraptorial Afrotherians? As a matter of fact, there is a very poorly understood order of the group called Ptolemaiida:

Judging from their large canines and apparently gracile build, it’s overall very probable that Ptolemaiidans were carnivorous, and big at that - about the size of wolves in most cases.

However, there’s still debate as to whether they were insectivores or possibly even herbivores, so let’s just assume that they weren’t carnivores for a second, just to answer the question further. I think the answer here is rather simple; the creodonts were right alongside them since they first evolved. In fact, the two groups appeared at about the same time, and hyaenodonts (the big ones) first popped up in Africa.

In case you don’t know, Creodonta is the sister taxon to Carnivora, being an extinct order of large carnivorous mammals which were the apex predators of much of the world from the Paleocene through to the Oligocene, after which they began to be outcompeted by the more energy-efficient carnivores. Here’s perhaps one of the larger creodonts, Hyainailoros:

Kind of relevant fun fact: the first remains of the aforementioned Ptolemaiidans, which were canine teeth, were originally thought to belong to a Hyaenodon, perhaps the most famous creodont of all.
