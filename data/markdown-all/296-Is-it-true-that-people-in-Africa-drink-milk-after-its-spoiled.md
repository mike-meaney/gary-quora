Some do, yes, and the reasons behind it are quite interesting. When milk “spoils”, it essentially ferments. The fermentation process is caused by a group of bacteria known as Lactobacillales, of which there are many species. These bacteria change the lactose in the milk into lactic acid and carbon dioxide, among other chemicals.

This sour milk is a feature of the diets of many native African people, and forms a major portion of that of the Maasai tribe, in East Africa. In fact, most of the Maasai diet is comprised of sour milk and cow blood, supplemented with beef, tubers and other wild foods. (Fun fact - the Maasai seem to have evolved to eat almost entirely animal protein without getting heart disease, and actually are more likely to get heart disease when eating a more balanced diet).

In any case, why is this? Well, nearly two thirds of people worldwide are lactose intolerant. In parts of Africa, South America and especially in East Asia, 95–100% of the adults in the communities there may have a reduced ability to break down lactose.

Of course, their babies are able to drink milk, but after infancy, many lose that ability. The same is true of pretty much all other mammal species. After all, why would they need to drink milk? Mammals didn’t evolve with dairy farming in mind.

Europeans, however, have been herding cattle for thousands of years. In that time, they’ve adapted to retain the ability to break down lactose into adulthood, so they can use cow milk as a food source. And as Europeans emigrated to places like North America and Australia, so did the genes for lactose tolerance.
