## How would you explain macro-evolution to someone who only accepts micro-evolution? With all due respect, please don't say â€˜micro-evolution + time'

Macroevolution includes speciation

Before you object to this, let me prove it to you.

> Macroevolution is [evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution "en.wikipedia.org") on a scale at or above the level of [species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species "en.wikipedia.org")

From Wikipedia.

> Macroevolution refers to the concept of large-scale evolution that occurs at the level of species and above.

From Biology Dictionary.

I think you get the point.

Anyway, speciation has been directly observed (Just look at this page by TalkOrigins: [Observed Instances of Speciation](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-speciation.html "www.talkorigins.org"). And it hasn’t been updated in nearly 25 years, so there’s bound to be a good few more since then, including the famous “Big Bird Lineage”.)

If you accept speciation, you accept macroevolution. If you don’t accept speciation, then you’re even more deluded than an average Creationist, to the point where it’s just denying things which are obviously true.
