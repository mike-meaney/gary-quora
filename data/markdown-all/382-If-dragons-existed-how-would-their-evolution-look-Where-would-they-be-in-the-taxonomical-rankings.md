## If dragons existed, how would their evolution look? Where would they be in the taxonomical rankings?

There are a handful of different reptile lineages I could see leading to species which resemble traditional Western dragons - pterosaurs, or monitor lizards, perhaps - but one which I find especially interesting to think about are the scansoriopterygids.

These were feathered dinosaurs which dwelt in Jurassic China, representing at least five species. Their similarities to dragons are obvious - they had a bat-like patagium, or membrane of skin, stretched between the fingers of each hand:

It’s unlikely that they could perform powered flight, instead using their wings to glide, or possibly weakly flap. However, that’s certainly a start - had they survived past the Jurassic, I could certainly see them evolving to truly fly. Perhaps, if they made it all the way past the meteor impact of the end-Cretaceous Extinction, they could become the dominant form of flying animal.

During the Mesozoic Era, pterosaurs mainly had the run of the skies, and by the end of it, some of them were huge - certain species in family known as Azhdarchidae even reaching quarter-ton masses. When they were wiped out by the mass extinction, it’s conceivable to imagine scansoriopterygids adapting to fill this vacant niche.

But how big could they be? Without drastic modifications to the typical land vertebrate body plan, I’m pretty confident that giant azhdarchid pterosaurs were around the maximum size for a flying reptile. One unnamed specimen from Romania - nicknamed Dracula - had an estimated wingspan of 12–20 metres, which is at the very least as wide as a typical bus is long.

These pterosaurs also likely spent most of their time on the ground, searching for smaller prey to snap up, and were well-adapted for terrestrial movement. I imagine that our dragons would have a similar lifestyle, only taking to the air to engage in long-distance, soaring flight.

So, no matter what they evolved from, real life dragons probably couldn’t reach the huge sizes they do in fantasy, but they could still be pretty damn big - provided the right environmental conditions. Thanks everyone for reading, have a great day.
