Ever heard of the mudskipper? It can spend three and a half hours on land, breathing through its skin.

What about the lungfish? It has limb-like fins, lungs and cannot breathe underwater. They can survive two years, hibernating, on land.

The rockskipper, maybe? It is largely terrestrial and spends little of its time in the ocean. It can leap several metres over rocks.

The woolly sculpin, then? When oxygen underwater runs out, it leaves its pools and goes to live on land for a while.

The American eel? On land, where it can spend extended periods of time, it can slither like a snake and climb barriers such as walls.

I assume you haven’t heard of the snakehead fish either. It, like lungfish, cannot breathe underwater and requires air to survive. It can “walk” with its pectoral fins.

What about chain morays, which forage on land?

The eel catfish, native to African swamps, which hunts terrestrial beetles?

The walking catfish, which is aptly named?

Not even climbing perches? They can, of course, breathe atmospheric oxygen, walk across the land, and even climb trees.

Hmm, what about epaulette sharks, which survive for several hours on land and can use their fins to crawl, all under the blistering Australian sun?

Bichirs? They have rudimentary lungs and can move about outside the water.

The mangrove rivulus, which lives in hollow logs on land for months at a time?

None of these? It seems your zoological knowledge is in need of updating, in that case.
