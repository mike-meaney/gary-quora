## What is the general composition of marine mammals blubber? Are there exceptional compositions, e.g., 90% sat fat, or 90% poly?

Oversimplified, blubber is basically just body fat, laced with collagen fibres and rich in lipids, with blood vessels running through it. If you want to get more technical, here is a study which looks into the composition of fin whale blubber - [The biochemical composition of fin whale blubber](https://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/z84-373?journalCode=cjz#.XOlRu8hKiUk "www.nrcresearchpress.com").

According to the paper, the blubber is largely lipids, with most of the rest being protein. One interesting thing it found was that the outer parts, closer to the dermis of the skin, had over twice as much lipids as the rest, with the inner tissue mainly proteinaceous.

Obviously, different marine mammals have different blubber. In toothed whales, this study - [Function and evolution of specialized endogenous lipids in toothed whales](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/221/Suppl_1/jeb161471 "jeb.biologists.org") - shows that there are two main types of body fat; triacylglycerols and waxes. The ratio of these two types in numerous cetacean species is shown in the diagram above.

I also found another paper, [Vertical fatty acid composition in the blubber of leopard seals and the implications for dietary analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098116300211 "www.sciencedirect.com"), which should be informative about seal blubber. It looked at the ratios of three different fatty acids - including saturated fat which you mentioned - in a sample of leopard seal tissue.

Thanks for the A2A, hope this answers the question.
