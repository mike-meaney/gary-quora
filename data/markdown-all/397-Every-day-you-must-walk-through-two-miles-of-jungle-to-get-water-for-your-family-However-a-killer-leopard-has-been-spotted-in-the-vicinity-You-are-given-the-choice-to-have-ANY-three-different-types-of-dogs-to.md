## Every day you must walk through two miles of jungle to get water for your family. However, a killer leopard has been spotted in the vicinity. You are given the choice to have ANY three different types of dogs to accompany you- which would they be?

#1 - Kangal shepherd dog

This Turkish breed holds the record for the strongest dog bite force ever measured, at 743 pounds per square inch. Bred as livestock guardians in the city of Sivas, they are among the fastest and most agile of all the very large dog breeds. Kangals weigh about 66 kilograms and are said to be highly courageous and protective.

#2 - Caucasian shepherd dog

There are several Russian breeds originally used for hunting bears, but of these the Caucasian shepherd is perhaps the largest and brawniest. Also known as the Caucasian Ovcharka, they are common in Georgia and Azerbaijan, and huge, too - the largest males can be over 100 kilograms in weight.

#3 - English mastiff

Leopards, as fairly gracile mesopredators, tend to fear large carnivores. As such, I might as well bring a huge dog. English mastiffs are the perfect candidates. Originally Celtic war dogs in Classical Antiquity, the largest recorded one was a magnificent 155 kilograms, as big as an average black bear.
