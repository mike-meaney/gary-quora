Here’s an elephant skull:

The eye socket-like cavity in the middle is actually the opening which the trunk connects to. Trunks often make skulls look wierd, like the one on this elephant seal:

And this tapir, too:

The skulls of hippopotamuses might lead you to believe that they were active predators:

Or maybe just demonic monsters. A lot of ungulates, especially rhinos, have high thoracic spikes, giving them the appearance of being sail-backed creatures:

Platypus skulls certainly don’t give any kind of bird-like impression:

And the bulging eye sockets of owl monkeys make them seem like some kind of alien humanoid race:

Looking at the skeleton of a bat, you would wonder what its long fingers were for, but few would guess that they were wings.

And, if someone was to find sea lion fossils, far in the future, they mightn’t ever expect it to be semi-aquatic, at least not unless they found a complete skeleton:

Lastly, the skeleton of a right whale suggests little of its aquatic, filter-feeding lifestyle:

Honorable mention: although it looks rather like its bizarre living counterpart, anteater skeletons are downright wierd:
