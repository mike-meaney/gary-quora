Bilateria is an ancient group, originating in the Precambrian, and as such its early fossil record is poor. As such, the formative days of this clade are still shrouded in mystery.

The earliest confirmed, irrefutably Bilaterian animal known is Kimberella, a bizarre, slug-like creature which has been dated to 555 million years ago.

However, the plot thickens. The proarticulates are a phylum of invertebrates which are, superficially, bilaterally symmetrical, but may not be true Bilaterians. In any case, they originated about 580 million years ago, which pushes back the date a further 25 million years ago.

Then thereâ€™s Vernanimalcula, a 600 million year old fossil. Its discoverers claim it had bilateral symmetry, triploblastic structure, a coelom (body cavity), mouth, anus and sense organs. However, other scientists strongly deny this and believe it to be something abiotic, not an animal at all.

So, in short, the fossil record is still unclear about when Bilateria appeared and what that first Bilaterian looked like. In any case, it was definitely before 555 million years ago.
