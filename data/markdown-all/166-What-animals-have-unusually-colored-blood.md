Interesting question. Let’s get started.

*   Prasinohaema \- this is a genus of lizards in the skink family, found in New Guinea and the neighbouring Solomon Islands. Their blood is filled with the pigment biliverdin (the same one which makes bruises greenish), and as a result they bleed green. The chemical is thought to increase resistance to malaria.

*   Crocodile icefish \- this family of fish is amazing in that they have no hemoglobin or red blood cells in their blood at all! As a result, icefish blood is colourless. The blood plasma carries the oxygen instead, albeit much less efficiently. They can survive without hemoglobin due to their slow metabolisms, an adaptation to frigid waters.

*   Ramshorn snails \- in contrast to the fish, these snails are fascinating because they do have hemoglobin, and as a result their blood is red. This is bizarre, because all other molluscs have a different protein - hemocyanin, which is blue or purple. The hemoglobin is thought to have evolved to transport oxygen more efficiently.

*   Amazon milk frogs \- this genus, Trachycephalus, could have blue blood. This is based on the fact that the inside of the mouth is blue, thin-skinned juveniles appear bluish, and that one individual with an abnormality known as a cloacal prolapse was seen to have blue flesh inside. As far as I know, this isn’t scientifically confirmed yet.

This has been one of my shortest list answers so far, but I can’t think of any more interesting examples. Thanks for reading, and hopefully you’ve enjoyed it.
