The thing about wolves is that they’re the most successful extant canine predators on the planet. Unchallenged in virtually any area they inhabit.

By that, of course, I mean by wild animals, as I’m sure you’re aware of humans killing wolves (Dogs are also capable of killing wolves, in case you didn’t know.). However, there are a few things out there that might… raise a wolf’s hackles.

Okay, bad pun. So, pumas can hunt wolf pups sometimes, but really nothing is gonna see an adult wolf, especially one in a pack, as food. However, there are some carnivores that compete with them for food.

Bears would be the main competitors in this situation, but there are records of lynxes attempting to drive wolves off carcasses, and striped hyenas compete with them in the Middle East (That being said, it’s thought that the two carnivores may sometimes cooperate.).

So, there’s a few examples of things a gray wolf might be driven into competition with. Additionally, African golden wolves are a bit lower down on the food chain in East Africa, and, historically, red wolves may have ran into conflict with jaguars, bears and pumas.
