## How did big cats in Africa diversify into lions, cheetahs and leopards, while they were all living in the same place?

The term “big cats”, in the way you’re using it, is what evolutionary biologists call a polyphyletic group. Here is a cladogram (Diagram of genetic relationships) of the cat family, Felidae:

Lions and leopards are both in the genus Panthera - they are, in fact, more closely related to each other than any other species in Panthera. Cheetahs, are, however, not closely related to either of them - in fact, many biologists place them in a different subfamily (Currently, some scientists say that there is one extant subfamily of felids, Felinae, while others say there are two; Felinae and Pantherinae).

The cheetah belongs to the genus Acinonyx (Meaning “non-moving claws”), which first appears in the Late Pliocene epoch, 3 million years ago. The oldest known species of Acinonyx is the “Linxia Cheetah”, A. kurteni. There’s still debate as to whether it is a hoax or not, but let’s assume it is. It was, allegedly, found in China, so we can assume that Cheetahs evolved in Asia, spreading through Europe (See A. pardinensis), and into Africa.

By the time the modern cheetah species evolved, leopards were in Africa, too, but there were no lions, which appeared soon after. However, they’re all adapted to different ecological niches.

Leopards are solitary, stealth predators - more or less, the stereotypical felid, at least in terms of ecology. Cheetahs, on the other hand, are solitary (A lot of the males hunt in packs, but they’re not physically adapted to do this), cursorial predators.

Ecologically, lions are kind of like cats trying to be dogs, or hyenas. They hunt co-operatively in prides, communicate during hunts (Using the dark fur on their ears, which they subtly move), and have outlines for what could become dog-like morphologies (Recurring readers of my answers may recall me, on numerous occasions, referring to “dog-” and “cat-style” predators. One of the morphological characteristics of “dog-style” predators are long snouts; cats have truncated jaws to dispatch prey quickly, but cursorial pack hunters don’t need to do this, so they elongate their snouts to improve sense of smell.)

In short; They all evolved at different times, and they now occupy different ecological niches.
