No, there are seven independent lineages of marine mammals.

Whales evolved from Artiodactyls which looked bit like Pakicetus:

Sirenians (manatees and dugongs) descend from portly Afrotheres resembling Prorastomus:

The ancestors of pinnipeds were likely otter-like creatures, such as Pujila:

The polar bear is the direct descendant of the brown bear:

And finally, sea otters, marine otters and sea minks essentially evolved from traditional mustelids, otters in the case of the first two and minks for the third;

Of course, all these clades share a common ancestor in the form of an early mammal, but in between them are many terrestrial groups too.
