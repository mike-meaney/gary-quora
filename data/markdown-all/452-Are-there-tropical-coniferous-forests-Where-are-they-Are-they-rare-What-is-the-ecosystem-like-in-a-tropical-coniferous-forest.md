Certainly! Huge swathes of Mexico are clothed in conifer forests, the largest such forests in the tropics. Much of the country is elevated thousands of metres above sea level, and most regions experience some sort of annual dry season.

Conifers, with their hardy, needle-shaped leaves, are very good at surviving these adverse conditions, in which most broad-leaved rainforest trees would struggle to endure. Because of this, they predominate in Mexico’s mountainous regions.

Mexico’s conifer forests are exceptionally biodiverse - no less than five of them are listed among the World Wildlife Fund’s high-priority “ecoregions”. They’re home to many endemic birds, as well as large mammals such as jaguars, pumas, bobcats and the rare Mexican wolf.

And, of course, they bear witness to North America’s famous monarch butterfly migration, hundreds of thousands strong.

Some islands in the nearby Caribbean, such as Cuba and Hispaniola, are also home to many pine forests, which are likewise home to an abundance of biodiversity. The largest of these are found in the Dominican Republic, as many of those in Haiti and Cuba have been cut down.

In the DR’s Cordillera Central, the highest mountain range in the Caribbean, the vegetation resembles that which you’d expect to find as far north as Canada. However, it lies well inside the tropics.

Even in lowland areas, you can find a variety of pine trees on many Caribbean islands. In some drier savannah regions, they are the dominant tree type due to their drought-resistant nature.

Over in Southeast Asia, you can find what are arguably the world’s hottest, most humid coniferous forests. They’re dotted along Sumatra’s mountainous spine of volcanoes, where the wind shadow effect means that some areas receive less rainfall than the surrounding jungle.

These forests are also prone to natural forest fires, which are part of the life cycle of the trees. In the wetter rainforest plains, fire is much less common, and broad-leaved trees dominate.

The Imogiri Pine Forest, near the city of Yogyakarta, Java, has become a popular tourist attraction. Funnily enough, it doesn’t look particularly exotic to me (there are forests which look just like it within walking distance from my house), but in Indonesia, it’s quite the change of scenery.

The Philippines is another part of the Malay Archipelago which has a rich selection of conifers. They’re mostly concentrated on Luzon (the northernmost and largest of the country’s main islands) , which is largely mountainous.

These areas are rich in mammal and bird species, such as bearded pigs, civets and the impressive Philippine eagle. However, there’s one I feel I should bring special attention to - the cloud rats.

Cloud rats, or cloudrunners, are endemic to the Philippines, and many species dwell in Luzon’s pine forests. They’re some of the largest - and cutest - rats in the world.

I should also mention that in southern and eastern Africa, evergreen trees such as the yellowwoods of the genus Podocarpus are common. Podocarpus latifolis, sometimes known as the real yellowwood, is actually the national tree of South Africa.

Podocarpus in Africa are mainly found in the Eastern Cape’s Great Escarpment and up the East African Rift Valley, being especially abundant in Ethiopia. There are also populations in Cameroon’s Atlantika Mountains and upland areas of Madagascar. Research suggests that in these highlands, the conifers dominate in areas with less sunlight.

Lastly, I think the forests of the Himalayas deserve a mention, even though they’re subtropical rather than tropical. This strip of pine forest spans parts of Pakistan, India, Nepal and Bhutan, all in the foothills of the Himalayan Range.

The most prevalent tree species here is the chir pine, Pinus roxburghii, while the ground is covered in grassy vegetation. This is due to the region’s tendency to experience wildfires, which prevent bushy undergrowth from growing. The wildlife in these forests is spectacular, and includes big cats such as tigers and leopards.

So, as you can see, conifer trees aren’t just found in northern latitudes - in highland areas with more seasonal change or slightly less rainfall, evergreens are better adapted to survive even near the equator. Thanks everyone for reading, I hope you enjoyed.
