So, this is probably what most people reading this think of when someone says “dragon”:

Large, scaly, four-legged, winged, horned or spiky, and capable of breathing fire. That being said, “dragons” in folklore are far, far more diverse than this body plan. In French legends, for example, they have giant snail dragons with tentacles,

Six-legged dragons with the head of a lion, the feet of a bear, the body of an ox, the shell of a turtle and the tail of a scorpion,

And winged serpentine dragons covered in fire with jewels for eyes.

However, for simplicity’s sake, let’s go with the type of dragon which most readers will be familiar with. The first issue I see is the four legs. For land vertebrates, the only really viable way to evolve a pair of wings is by adapting the forelimbs into them. Hence, birds, bats and pterosaurs all have wings on their forelimbs:

Consider that all the precursors to wings must also provide a survival advantage - an animal couldn’t simply sprout some fleshy appendages out of its shoulders which would eventually evolve into true wings, because for millions of years they would be useless and unnecessary.

On the other hand, a half-wing on each forelimb can do a multitude of things. The ancestors of bats used their pre-wings to slow their falls as they jumped from trees. Birds’ ancestors may have used them to glide, or run up vertical surfaces. It’s even thought that the ancestors of pterosaurs hopped like kangaroos, and used their arms to generate lift.

And, as it happens, all land vertebrates have four limbs - unless, of course, they have lost limbs, like snakes and cetaceans, something much, much more simple than gaining new limbs. So, in short, if a dragon has four legs and two wings, it’s got an extra pair of limbs that needs explaining.

“What if it evolved an extra pair?”, you might ask. Remember what I said earlier - the transitional phases of the organs must have a use too. A pair of almost-limbs dangling from the torso would provide no survival advantage. Yes, very occasionally animals are born with extra legs due to mutations, but they are deformed individuals who would never survive in the wild.

Long story short: A winged dragon has to have two legs. In modern fantasy, these dragons are referred to as wyverns.

In fact, the reasons George R.R. Martin created dragons as two-legged creatures were essentially the same as those outlined above.

The next thing I’m going to talk about is fire-breathing. Surprisingly, this part is more plausible than a four-legged winged dragon. After all, dragons aren’t the only animals which defend themselves by ejecting scalding concoctions…

So, there will have to be some kind of chemical reaction going on in the dragon’s throat. Some substances are pyrophoric, meaning they ignite on contact with air. There are several such molecules which organisms could conceivably manufacture - iron sulfide, for example, or phosphine (as seen in Dragonriders of Pern).

But - as [this article](https://www.sciencenewsforstudents.org/article/nature-shows-how-dragons-might-breathe-fire "www.sciencenewsforstudents.org") explains, those chemicals are gases at room temperature, and using gas isn’t a very viable option. It tends to spread out, and can be blown by the wind, meaning that fire-breathing would be dangerous to the dragon. You’d be better off using something liquid - specifically, an alcohol.

You could use methanol (above left), which burns almost transparent and cool blue, or perhaps ethanol (right), which will yield a fiery orange flame. These chemicals could be produced by microbes in the dragon’s gut.

Lastly, I’ll address the issue of where dragons fit into the tree of life. In other words, what are dragons? What did they evolve from? What are their closest “real” relatives? There are a number of candidates I would suggest:

*   Scansoriopterygids. These were a family of dinosaurs, closely related to birds, which lived during the Jurassic. They were remarkably dragonlike, with membranous wings on their forelimbs. That being said, they couldn’t fly, only glide. Suppose they didn’t go extinct, and became the dominant flying animals in the Cretaceous instead of azhdarchids. Then they could grow to very large sizes.

*   Pterosaurs. Alternatively, you could go with these guys - their wings won’t be as similar to those of typical fantasy dragons, but pterosaurs could already fly, and some - the azhdarchids - grew to have wingspans of over 10 metres and possibly weigh up to a quarter of a ton. If these survived the K-Pg extinction event, I could certainly see them evolving into dragon-like animals.

*   Monitor lizards. (And their relatives). Among modern reptiles, varanoids are among the most active and advanced, despite having been around since the Cretaceous. They are perhaps the least sluggish of the bunch, with great stamina, and an advanced, bird-like respiratory system. Some of them live in trees, too. In other words, they’re in a pretty good position to evolve powered flight.

This has been a long answer, so to summarize: realistic dragons would have two legs, spray some kind of inflammable liquid from their mouths, and would probably be closely related to scansoriopterygids, pterosaurs or monitor lizards.
