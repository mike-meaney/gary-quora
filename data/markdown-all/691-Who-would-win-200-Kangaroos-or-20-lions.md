TL;DR: probably the lions, but it’s gonna take a long, long time

So, let’s look at the kangaroos. For this, I’ll assume the species is a Red Kangaroo, Macropus rufus. They’re very fast, being able to hop at 70 km/h for short distances, and an impressive 40 km/h over nearly two kilometres. Their main weapons are their grasping claws, and their feet. A kick from a fighting kangaroo can relieve an opponent of his internal organs.

The lion, Panthera leo, is also a formidable opponent. It is the second fastest member of the cat family, and can attain speeds of up to 70 km/h for short distances. Four keratinous claws can inflict deadly slashes on any victim, and jaws bite with the force of 1,000 psi, equipped with large canines and special carnassial teeth characteristic of the carnivore order. Females are more agile and graceful, but males are thickly muscled and usually take part in toppling the largest prey items.

So, if we introduced a pride of 20 lions and a herd of 200 kangaroos into some kind of closed area, then at first both species would be wary of the other. After a while, however, the lions would begin to get bolder and bolder, and one of them might take their chances with a kangaroo. If this happened, the kangaroo would most likely give the cat a powerful kick, which could end up disemboweling the attacker.

Over time, which may take hours, or days, the lions would begin to see the kangaroos as prey, not least if they hadn’t eaten until then. The pride would chase one, and possibly kill it, and they would gain a taste for kangaroo. For weeks, they’d kill a few every day, and possibly attain injuries, but overall they’re just more powerful animals.

If kangaroos weight as much as lions, then this battle might never end, ever. That’s because, in a sustainable ecosystem, the biomass of prey must be ten times that of the biomass of predators, and 200 is obviously ten times 20. However, my rough calculations show that the kangaroos’ biomass (Assuming that they are all fully-grown) is a bit more than twice that of the lions’ biomass, with a roughly 1:2.15 ratio.

I presume that there is enough food in this arena for the kangaroos to graze, because otherwise, the battle would end when they all starved. If the kangaroos have food, however, the lions will just keep on chipping away at their population, and they’ll have babies, but the rate at which they produce offspring will not exceed the rate at which they’re being hunted.

After weeks or months, there will be no kangaroos left, because the lions killed them all.
