I answered a similar question before and nominated the tiny seal Praepusa \- see [Gary Meaney's answer to What extinct animal would make the best pet?](https://www.quora.com/What-extinct-animal-would-make-the-best-pet/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"). I still stand by it as the cutest, but here I’ll give some other runner-ups.

Dromaeosauriformipes, a dromaeosaur (“raptor”), known only from footprints, which was only the size of a sparrow, making it one of the tiniest non-bird dinosaurs known.

Gobiraptor, a diminutive member of the dinosaur group known as the oviraptorisaurs. It contrasts starkly with the largest oviraptorisaur, Gigantoraptor, which was twice the weight of a car.

Parvulivenator, the smallest raptor of all time. To its right in the illustration Eostrix, an owl and another tiny bird of prey. The two genera even lived at the same time.

Cartorhynchus, an early relative of ichthyosaurs which wasn’t yet fully aquatic. You could call it a reptilian seal. Also, it was teeny-weeny-weeny.

Anurognathus, a Jurassic pterosaur of the rhamporhyncoid variety, which had a snubby snout and huge eyes. Some reconstruct it as a potoo-like monstrosity, but others stick with this much cuter appearance.

Robertia, a small dicynodont. Dicynodonts were Permian-Triassic stem-mammals which had - bizarrely - both toothless beaks and tusks. This one was likely a burrower.

Alright, that’s enough from me. I might edit this with more later on.
