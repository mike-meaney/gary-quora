## Is there any incontrovertible evidence that T. rex had feathers, or is this simply a hypothesis?

It is an inference based on various fossil tyrannosauroids having feathers, as well as feathering being a possible ancestral condition in dinosaurs (I say “possible” because some hypothesize that the quill-like “feathers” of ornithischians like Psittacosaurus are in fact highly modified scales).

I’m a zoologist, not a paleontologist, so I won’t be saying authoritatively whether or not T. rex had any kind of filamentous integument. However, I might as well present some evidence against it having feathers from a recent paper.

Phil Bell et al., 2017, published a study in which he argued that Tyrannosaurus was scaly and not feathered. Skin impressions from T. rex have been found on the tail, neck and pelvis, as well as ones on the thorax from the closely related Daspletosaurus and Tarbosaurus - the latter is even thought by many to be either in the Tyrannosaurus genus as T. bataar or even a T. rex. All these impressions show that tyrannosaurids had tiny reticulated scales at least in those places.

So, having scales on the tail, neck, hips and chest would lead most scientists to believe that T. rex was entirely coated in scales, since it would be odd to have it in isolated patches. Still, there’s a possibility of a dorsal coat of quills, which could be a display feature or for thermoregulation, as most body heat is lost at the top of the body (hence why humans have hair on their heads).

Furthermore, several bone structures on the skull seem to be adapted for scales, although this is not known for sure. Now, on the subject of thermoregulation, think of pachyderms - that’s a polyphyletic term for elephants, rhinoceroses and hippopotami.

How do they differ from other mammals? Obviously, they have only very short, inconspicuous hair, rather than fur. Bell’s paper proposes that Tyrannosaurus rex’ huge size, which was roughly on par with that of an elephant, would have caused its ancestors to lose their feathers.

There are arguments against this comparison. So far, I’ve heard points such as “elephants have semi-aquatic ancestors” and “plant digestion produces more body heat”. These arguments, in my opinion, are flawed. For one thing, aquatic ancestry (Which is only a hypothesis for elephants, given that early Proboscideans such as Moeritherium were possibly water-dwellers) does not rob an animal of its integument for good - the hairs are still there, and they will come back if necessary.

Secondly, the argument that digesting plants produces body heat is, for want of a better term, rubbish. Tyrannosaurus rex was an active predator that would have had to deal with running, hunting and brawling - in short, an exponentially more active lifestyle than elephants. This would have produced far more body heat than digestion, which doesn’t make much heat anyway.

Lastly, the sauropods, which definitely had feathered ancestors, grew to massive sizes, and guess what - they too lost their feathers.

In conclusion, that picture above is probably the most up-to-date reconstruction of Tyrannosaurus rex to date. If you want to know what it looked like, then that’s the best we have… for now.
