Well… yes and no.

Many other animal species have sadly become morbidly obese, but only in captive conditions where their food is provided by humans. This includes overfed, under-exercised animals in poor-quality zoos…

And deliberately fattened animals used as test subjects for scientific studies.

There are also wild animals which are really fat. Just before they’re weaned, seal pups typically reach 40% body fat. For a (male) human with this percentage, weight loss would be extremely important and health risks would manifest.

However, for the seals it’s completely healthy. After being weaned they will be inexperienced at catching food for themselves, so the extra fat reserves are crucial for survival while they learn the ropes. Also, there is of course the thick layer of blubber they have for insulation.

Similarly, animals which hibernate often require huge fat reserves to make it through the winter, with brown bears being the most endearing example. Katmai National Park in Alaska actually holds an annual “Fat Bear Week” during their bulking season.

(Irrelevant but fun fact: the opposite of hibernation is called aestivation; dormancy during the hot and dry summer. A few mammals do this, including a tiny lemur which stores fat in its thick tail.)

So, the only “obese” animals are either those under human care, or those which temporarily depend on fat reserves for survival. Those in the latter category couldn’t be morbidly obese, of course, because it’s necessary for their health.

Generally, obesity as a health risk can only exist in a scenario where food is abundant, and - crucially - mobility is not a prerequisite for acquiring that food. If a lion gets a little chubby, he’ll struggle to run down prey, and enter a caloric deficit. In the wild, body weight self-regulates.
