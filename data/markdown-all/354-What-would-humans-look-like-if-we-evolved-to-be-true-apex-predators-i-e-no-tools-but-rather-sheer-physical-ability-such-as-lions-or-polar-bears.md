## What would humans look like if we evolved to be true apex predators (i.e. no tools but rather sheer physical ability such as lions or polar bears)?

First of all, we’d need some kind of natural weaponry. Claws are a possibility, and would be especially useful considering that we are bipedal and thus have our hands free to slash things.

However, I think a much more plausible and likely evolutionary path would be to evolve teeth as our primary weapons, as we, as primates, have nails, not claws. The human mouth might end up looking much like that of a gelada, which is ironically strictly herbivorous.

Sharp teeth are no use without force, though. The human bite is, frankly, pitifully weak in its current form. To increase bite force, we’d need to evolve more robust jaws, and bigger jaw muscles. The bigger the muscles, the more pronounced the attachment points must be.

Therefore, we might evolve to have either:

*   Broad cheekbones. An example of this in primates is in the extinct Theropithecus brumpti.

*   A high sagittal crest, which is the ridge at the top of most mammals’ skulls. One such primate with a pronounced one is the gorilla:

So, so far what we’ve got is a human with huge sharp teeth, wide cheekbones and a sort of hump on the top of its head. I would also recommend thick, muscular neck.

We’ve established that these predatory humans’ primary weapon is their jaws, not their claws. For large mammalian predators, that generally tends to entail a lot of other adaptations such as pack behaviours and running ability.

Humans are excellent at long-distance running, but there’s a difference between persistence hunting and how wolves run their prey into the ground. These killer apes will have to be reasonably fast, too, and thus will probably have long legs and good explosive strength.

Anyway, that’s just my take on what an apex predator hominin would look like. Evolution could go other ways, certainly, but this is what I consider to be the most likely path to hypercarnivory.
