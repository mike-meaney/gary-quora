## I am wondering, if there is any evolutionary connection between the formation of fish (e.g shoals of sardines) and bird flocks?

Well… maybe. Assuming you mean “formation” as in the formation in which they swim/fly in, rather than them “forming” groups, then that’s the answer.

So it’s a fairly well-known fact why birds flock. The beating wings of the bird at the front creates circular patterns of moving air, wingtip vortices, which in turn create upwash. This upwash helps the adjacent of the birds stay aloft, and their wings do the same for the ones behind them, and so on and so on.

Geese, ducks and several other migratory species have the most advanced form of this strategy, flying in a classic V shape which can increase the range of each bird by 71%.

Similarly, there is a theory which proposes that schooling fish utilize this same mechanism for hydrodynamic efficiency. However, experiments have been conducted in laboratory fish and failed to find any gains from the lift produced by the leading fish.

See [Functions of Shoaling Behaviour in Teleosts](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238235966_Functions_of_Shoaling_Behaviour_in_Teleosts "www.researchgate.net") for more information on that. Despite the research, Wikipedia says that:

> It is still thought that efficiency gains do occur in the wild.

So, as said, the answer is a rather unsatisfactory maybe. Hope this answers your question, thanks for asking.
