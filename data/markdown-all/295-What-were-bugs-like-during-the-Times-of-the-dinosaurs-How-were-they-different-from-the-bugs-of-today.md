## What were bugs like during the Times of the dinosaurs? How were they different from the bugs of today?

By the end of the Mesozoic era, most bugs would have looked very familiar. There were ants, bees and beetles, moths, and many more representatives of living groups. That being said, we still have many exciting amber fossils of them, like this one of a spider attacking a wasp: [100-Million-Year-Old Spider Attack Found in Amber](https://www.livescience.com/23796-spider-attack-found-in-amber.html "www.livescience.com").

However, as you’d expect, there were still many fascinating oddballs among the insects, even in the most recent end of the Mesozoic, the Cretaceous. Here’s a little list of some of the strangest (and most underrated) bugs from this period of history.

*   Aptenoperissus, a parasitic wasp which was flightless and had enlarged hind legs for jumping, just like a grasshopper or cricket.

*   Pedanoptera, a lacewing whose larvae were evidently specialized spider-hunters. They had long, spindly legs for treading on spider webs without themselves falling prey to the spider they stalked.

*   Yijenplatycnemis, a bizarre damselfly. It had translucent, patterned “flags” projecting from its legs, which were probably involved in some sort of courtship dance.

*   Manipulator, which I’ve mentioned in previous answers. It was a cockroach, but it had raptorial forelimbs, a long neck and a mobile head, like a praying mantis. This was clearly a fearsome predator of a roach.

*   Ceratomyrmex, also known as the “unicorn ant”, an ant which had a horn between its antennae covered in sensory bristles. It also had oversized, vertically-pointing mandibles.

*   Ginormotermes, one of the largest termites ever to exist. The soldiers were almost an inch long, which - though it seems small - is giant for a termite.

*   Cretotrichopsenius (the brown, round guy in the illustration), a little beetle which apparently burrowed into the nests of termites and lived there, feeding on their gardens of fungi.

*   Linguatormyia, a fly which was a pollinator. Its proboscis was nearly half its body length long, and its antennae were equivalent to over one and a half times its body length!

*   Zhenia, a parasitic fly which used large larvae such as caterpillars as hosts. Its most distinctive feature was its huge pair of eyes, which were so big that they nearly touched in the middle of the head.

*   Oregramma, one of a diverse group of neuropterans, or lacewings, which were evidently the butterflies of the dinosaur world. They had specialized mouthparts for pollinating, and big, conspicuous wings too.

*   Hallucinochrysa, a lacewing which was a master of disguise. Its larvae covered themselves in debris such as dirt, wood, plants and even the exoskeletal remains of their victims for camouflage.

The coolest part? Every one of the bugs I described above, and more, lived in Burma roughly 99 million years ago. Perhaps it was just a wonderland of weird insects, but the more likely explanation is simply the country’s famously exceptional wealth of amber fossils.

The fact that logically succeeds that is that perhaps there were fascinating Cretaceous creepy crawlies the world over, only for most to remain hidden due to improper preservational conditions. In fact, most of what we know about Mesozoic insects comes from Burmese amber.

However, there is one group not from that place and time which I think deserves mention - the titanopterans. Titanopterans were related to grasshoppers, but had the striking forelimbs of praying mantises. Oh, and the largest of them were as big as birds, with 36 centimetre wingspans!

I wouldn’t be surprised if they ate baby dinosaurs, in fact. One thing interesting about titanopterans is that they lived during the Triassic, when the atmosphere was only 11% oxygen. This seemingly overturns the notion that giant insects need high oxygen levels to exist, and reveals that huge, bird-sized bugs could probably survive in today’s conditions.
