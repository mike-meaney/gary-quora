Fear not, for I have an arsenal of perfect meal-ruining examples of horrific parasitic creatures. I’d advise against reading this while you’re eating

Dinobdella ferox: This leech is a member of a family which only suck blood from the mucous membranes of their hosts. That means entering through one of the Holy Trinity of Places You Don’t Want Leeches to Enter - the nose, anus or urethra.

To research this species, one insane Taiwanese scientist administered Dinobdella ferox leeches up his own nose - three times! Inside, they grew to be 380 times their original size, and would often stick their tails out the nostril conspicuously.

Placentonema gigantissima: This monster, which lives only in the placentas of mother sperm whales, holds the record for the world’s largest nematode worm. Thicker than your thumb and a staggering 8.4 meters long, it’s a true giant. Despite its size, P. gigantissima is still poorly understood.

As far as we know, the worm burrows into a female sperm whale and enters its placenta. Then, when the whale gives birth and the placenta is expulsed, the worm dies, and gives birth - from the grave.

Riggia puyensis: This is a type of isopod (so distantly related to woodlice) which is a parasite of armoured catfish in South America. It’s pretty horrific - let’s imagine you’re a catfish. After burrowing into your body cavity, Riggia puyensis will remain there for the rest of your life, and a steady stream of its eggs will flow out of a hole in your belly.

If that wasn’t bad enough, it’ll also make your genitals shrink. That’s because it seems to alter its host hormonally, directing its hormones towards a growth spurt (thus creating more nutrition), at the cost of reproductive function.

Turtle leeches: These leeches are marine, and only parasitize sea turtles. If leeches weren’t bad enough, they very often transmit a disease to the turtles known as fibropapillomatosis. This causes large tumours to sprout all over the body, and in some populations 70% of sea turtles suffer from it.

Thankfully, humans are able to treat fibropapillomatosis, usually by surgically removing the tumours. There was one recorded case of a turtle leech attached to a dolphin, but thankfully for the cetacean, only sea turtles can contract the disease.

Massospora cicadina: Have you ever wondered what it would be like if your anus disintegrated? No? Well, in any case, now you don’t have to, because this parasitic fungus does just that to periodical cicadas. You may have heard of them - every 13 or \`17 years, they hatch en masse in densities of 370 million individuals per square kilometre. I think I’ll write an answer on them in the future.

In any case, when the billions of cicadas hatch, the fungus is waiting for them. When infected, their abdomen will gradually crumble into nothing but chalky spores, which come off whenever rubbed against something, dispersing the M. cicadina. Despite this, the cicadas seem to go about their lives normally, although their behaviour can change to a degree.

Passeromyia longicornis: It was only so long before an Australian species would show up here. Passeromyia longicornis is a Tasmanian fly, and as an adult it’s fairly standard. However, its larvae attack the newly hatched chicks of pardalotes, a type of small bird. Within hours after hatching, the maggots bore into the skin of the poor chick.

Once inside, they start sucking the hatchling’s blood. They suck more and more blood, until they’ve exhausted the chick’s supply and it drops dead. They’re extremely efficient - in fact, if a chick has been infected by the maggots, there’s an 85% chance it’ll die within weeks.

Frigatebirds: You might be surprised to find these here, but trust me, these seabirds are both parasitic and repulsive. Specifically, they’re kleptoparasites - they steal the food which other animals put effort into procuring. When they see another seabird - say, a boobie - catch a fish, they harass it, chasing it across the water for ages.

If you’ve ever done intense exercise straight after eating, you’ll know that the bird is in for an upset stomach. In fact, the exertion will often cause them to throw up their meal, and the frigatebirds in tow will swoop in, catch the vomit mid-air, and gulp it down. Imagine chasing someone just to eat their vomit…

Here's a question for you all, out of interest - if you were to be infected by one of these parasites, which would you choose? Maybe you can conclude the dinner with that, if your guests haven't left yet.
