It’s hard to single out a certain one so I’ll give a few here. First of all, some caterpillars.

Eupithecia is a diverse genus of moths - and I mean diverse. Wikipedia has over 1,400 pages each on a different species of Eupithecia. However, there are three species which are especially interesting - E. storioris, E. staurophagma and E. scoriodes.

These species - all of them native only to Hawaii - are the world’s only carnivorous caterpillars. They lie in wait, mimicking twigs or stalks, until a prey item passes by. In the blink of an eye, they snatch the prey with their monstrous forequarters. Their legs are tipped with great hooked claws for disemboweling victims.

Another type of caterpillar - the amphibious caterpillar (12 species) - is also only found in Hawaii, and it is the only insect which lives as readily in water as it does on land. Furthermore, they’re the only air-breathing animals in the world which can survive being submerged for a full month.

They don’t have gills, but they don’t come to the surface to breathe either. Their method of respiration is more unique; they absorb oxygen through pores in the skin. In fact, they actually require water - specifically flowing water - to breathe! They also build silk coccoons, tethered to the riverbed, to stop them from being carried away.

Slug caterpillars are aptly named - for they resemble, in many respects, slugs. They appear rotund and gelatinous, and have lost many of their legs, which they have traded for octopus-like suckers. Those legs that do remain are highly reduced in size and use liquefied silk as a lubricant to help the caterpillar move.

Now, bagworm moths. Once a bagworm moth hatches, it immediately begins building a sort of “log cabin”, a boxy case built of wood. These cases come in many shapes and sizes, and I wish I could show more here. The moths eat and even defecate in their little house, and the females never leave it in their whole lives.

When it is time to mate, the male bagworm moths emerge from their cases and fly away to find potential partners. The females are flightless, since they stay in their cabins, but they do have vestigial wing-like structures.

You probably know that bees make honey from nectar. You probably don’t know that some bees make honey from the anal secretions of greenflies. However, you almost certainly haven’t heard of vulture bees, and how they make their honey.

Vultures bees - 3 species, genus Trigona - make honey exclusively out of meat. When they find a carcass - be it a reptile, amphibian, fish, bird, or even a primate - they swarm all over it, entering through the eyes and chewing it up with saw-like mandibles. They churn the flesh into a sort of soupy meat pulp, which they convert to honey.

However, I think the most bizarre group of insects, in my opinion, are Callipappid scale insects. They start their lives as weird, mite-looking things called “crawlers”. When the females metamorphose out of that nymph stage, they become legless, waxy lumps called “cysts”, pictured below. They look kind of like wilted berries.

Meanwhile, the males are tiny flying things. However, since the cysts live underground, latched onto tree roots, they can’t get to the females. So - get this - the lumps regrow legs, break free, and walk once again! They crawl up to the surface where they can mate.

Now, the female stores her eggs in a marsupial-like pouch, and dies. Before long, the carcass turns into a leathery mummy. And then, believe it or not, the newborn crawlers burst out of their mother’s corpse! They then burrow underground, attach to a root, and, if female, become shapeless cysts.

Those, in my opinion, are just a few of the weirdest, most interesting insects. Admittedly I could go on for quite some more. Most people know that insects are a diverse lot, but perhaps they don’t quite grasp just how diverse they really are.
