Almost all big cats are solitary - it’s what they’re adapted to do. Because of that, they don’t need to communicate with other members of their species, except their cubs.

Lions, however, are an exception. They, as you probably know, live in prides, and hunt cooperatively. Cooperation, obviously, needs communication, but they can’t vocalize during a hunt, because that would alert the prey to their presence.

Instead, lionesses subtly twitch conspicuous body parts in order to communicate with their fellow huntresses. Those body parts are usually 1) the ears, and 2) the tail. The dark fur means that the other lions can see it easily in the otherwise lion-colored grass, and the prey can’t see it because it’s facing towards behind the lionesses.
