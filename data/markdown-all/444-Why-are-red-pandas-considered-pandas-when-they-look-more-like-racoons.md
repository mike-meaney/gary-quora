Technically, it’s the giant panda that shouldn’t be considered a panda.

If you look at most old, 19th century sources, red pandas are referred to simply as “pandas”, because giant pandas were not known in the West until decades later. Even Encyclopaedia Britannica used “panda” to refer to the red panda a few years ago - [panda (mammal, Ailurus species)](https://web.archive.org/web/20130515120439/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/441037/panda "web.archive.org").

Even after the discovery of the giant panda, the red panda was still often called the true or common panda. Over time, as the panda bear became increasingly popular in the West, it instead adopted the name “panda” and the red panda was more or less forgotten.

In any case, the giant panda isn’t “considered” a panda, it just as a misnomeric name. There are literally hundreds of those in the animal kingdom.
