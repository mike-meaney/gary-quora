## Why is such a big deal made over the African palm civet in carnivore evolution studies?

Thanks for the A2A, and sorry for the late answer.

Morphological and molecular studies have shown that the African palm civet ought to be placed in a separate taxon from Viverrids, meaning that it is the only species in the family Nandiinidae.

Aside from this interesting prospect, I’ve never really heard any talk about Nandiinids in the world of zoology. I believe they diverged from the Viverrids about 45 mya, which would have been before the Felids, but otherwise I can’t think of anything.

So, I’m going to assume that its uniqueness is all you mean. Perhaps because there is only one species, but it is derived enough to be a separate family? I’ve never heard of any Nandiinid radiation (And neither has Wikipedia), which - if there was none - is unusual.

I hope this answers your question, and if you could specify the “big deal” it’d be great. Again, thanks for asking.
