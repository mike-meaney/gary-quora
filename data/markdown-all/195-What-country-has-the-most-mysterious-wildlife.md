There are plenty of good candidates for this question, but the country I’m going to choose is Laos. It’s a Southeast Asian land of rugged mountains and humid tropical climes, and though it doesn’t get as much attention as its neighbours, it hides a wealth of obscure wildlife. In many ways, Laos is one of the world’s final zoological frontiers, a place where surprising new species are still being discovered.

In fact, if we ever find a completely unknown living mammal species of large size, I’d bet that it’d be in or very near Laos.

After all, the last time this happened, we found the giant muntjac of the Annamite Range, a chain of densely forested mountains in Laos and Vietnam. It was discovered in only 1994, and is critically endangered. Most muntjacs (also known as barking deer) are around the size of small dogs, but they are dwarfed by this Laotian species, which can weigh up to 50 kg!

The time before that, a year prior, we found the so-called “Asian Unicorn” - the saola. Like the giant muntjac, it’s a mysterious inhabitant of the Annamites, and is classified as critically endangered. This antelope is so rare and reclusive that it had never even been photographed in the wild until 1999. “Saola” roughly translates to “spindle-horn” in a local Tai language.

Some large mammals which are widely thought to be extinct may even be alive and well in Laos. Schomburgk’s deer once abounded in the swamps of central Thailand, but in 1938, it was declared extinct due to hunting and habitat loss. However, in 1991, a strange antler found at a medicine shop in Laos was identified as that of a Schomburgk’s deer.

One could speculate that there are still a few left, holding out in untrodden Laotian rainforests.

The smaller mammalian fauna of this nation is just as fascinating, if not more. A couple of its members featured in my [last answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-interesting-and-little-known-rodents/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"), but I can’t help but go over them again here.

First of all, there’s the Laotian rock rat. It was a puzzling and exciting find when it was discovered in 2005, as it was clearly an extremely unique rodent. Scientists initially placed it in a new family of its own, Laonastidae, but it soon became clear that it belonged to an already known group - the diatomyids.

The only strange thing, of course, was that the dinomyids were thought to have gone extinct over 10 million years ago! For this reason, the Laotian rock rat is considered a living fossil, or Lazarus taxon - it even has the nickname “coelacanth of rodents”.

Another very recent discovery found only in Laos is the Laotian giant flying squirrel. It was documented for the first and only time in 2012, when scientists encountered a strange dead creature in a bushmeat market of questionable legality. To this day, no biologist has seen it alive.

What we do know about this species is that it’s pretty big. It measures around a metre in length, making it both the largest known squirrel and one of the largest gliding animals in the world. Its closest known relative, the Namdapha flying squirrel, is shown below.

I also must bring up a rather adorable critter endemic to the Annamite Mountains; the aptly-named Annamite striped rabbit. It has a gorgeous black-and-gold colour scheme which is quite unique among rabbits and their relatives. This one was discovered in 2000.

And all that just describes a fraction of Laos’ fascinating array of mammals! There is an untold bounty of invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians and birds to be found in its jungles and savannahs, too. Many of them can’t be found in any other country.

A small sampling of its non-mammalian endemic wildlife might include the bizarre-looking bare-faced bulbul, found in 2009:

Rhacophorus spelaeus, a creature which - despite belonging to the tree frog family - dwells deep within limestone caverns. It was discovered in 2010.

And Heteropoda maxima, a true cave monster. Measuring a hair-raising thirty centimetres across, it’s the largest spider in the world by legspan. First reported in 2001.

The common theme throughout this answer is that all these species were discovered in the last 30 years. Hopefully, that means there are many more waiting to be discovered, hiding in the secluded wilderness of Laos. For that reason, I think it is the country with the most mysterious wildlife, and I’m excited to hopefully witness what more it has to offer.

Thank you for reading, have a great day!
