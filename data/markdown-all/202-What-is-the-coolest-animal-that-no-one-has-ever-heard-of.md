Perhaps for this animal, “no one” is a bit of a stretch. But for a large, pack-hunting canid, which takes down animals much larger than itself, it’s incredibly underrated. The animal I’m talking about is the dhole.

Perhaps it has more fans in India, where it mainly hails from today, but as far as I know, the rest of the world seriously needs to give this guy some more appreciation.

So, anyways, the dhole, Cuon alpinus, is a member of the dog family which is cladistically most closely related to the genus Canis \- that’s golden jackals, coyotes and wolves. They usually weigh in at around 15 kilograms, but large males can have a mass of 20, which is about the size of a small female wolf.

The dhole is also a beautiful animal, having widely-spaced eyes, large ears, and a luxuriant fluffy tail. The fur is reddish, turning a bright rusty red in winter (with brown highlights), and fading to a less vivid hue as the year progresses. The Ussuri dhole may be entirely orange or with white underparts, while the Sumatran dhole has a similar coloration, and the Northern dhole has a yellow-white winter coat.

Dholes are, like the much better known wolves and wild dogs, social animals which live in large groups. These are called clans rather than packs, since a pack will always hunt together, while a clan (such as a hyena’s) often sees different members or subgroups go out to forage on their own. They live in the nearly seasonless latitudes of the world, so annual scarcities of food are not much of an issue - because of this, dholes do not require as much of a rigorous hierarchy.

They are quite varied in terms of clan size. In Thailand, most clans comprise only 3 individuals, while 15–20 could be seen as an average, and 40 as an upper limit. They’re a lot less territorial than wolves, and mature males may often switch from clan to clan without any conflict. Dholes, at least among their own group, rarely fight.

Dholes can usually be found in India, China, and Southeast Asia, and are probably present in Pakistan, too. In recent history, they ranged throughout the southern half of China, even reaching Mongolia, but human activity has decimated their former range. Further back in time, however, they were extremely successful, being known from most of Asia and Europe, as well as Alaska and Mexico.

One thing which strikes me as odd is that, despite their impressive menu, dholes receive little attention from the Western world. They have been recorded to prey on not only hares, rats and monkeys, but also a large number of deer species, as well as mouse deer (small deer-like animals), gaur, buffalo, banteng and cattle (all of which are huge bovines), tapirs and fearsome wild boar. There is even one record of dholes in India tackling a young elephant.

Dholes usually hunt during the early hours of the morning, since they rely heavily on sight as their dominant sense, and are poor at seeing in the dark night. They can chase their prey for many hours, rarely running less than half a kilometre before they catch it, and will often - spectacularly - chase the prey into water. Like most canids, they do not use a quick, killing bite to the throat, instead having one pack member bite the nose, while the rest attack the flanks and hindquarters. The eyes are often slashed to blind the struggling prey, and once the animal is on the ground, it can take well over 15 minutes before the animal dies.

Their relationships with other carnivores are not always harmonious. Dhole packs have been known to attack tigers and leopards on occasion, and further north, sloth bears, Asiatic bears and snow leopards will come into conflict with clans. It has been noted that dholes co-operatively block cave entrances before bears can retreat into them.

A final word; as you might except, the dhole’s fate is uncertain. Local farmers, though it has is less common nowadays, will still poison, snare, shoot and club them should they think that their livestock has been killed, and they suffer greatly from habitat loss and prey depletion, both of which are caused by humans. Disease transfer from dogs, both domestic and feral, is also an issue.

Well, that’s about it - I wrote a lot more than I thought. I hope you’ve enjoyed reading this answer, and would like to thank you for reading it in the first place.

P.S. - since I suspect that a large portion of readers will be Indian, I’m curious to know - how well-known are dholes in India? More or less nobody has heard of them here, but I was wondering if they’d be better known in their range.
