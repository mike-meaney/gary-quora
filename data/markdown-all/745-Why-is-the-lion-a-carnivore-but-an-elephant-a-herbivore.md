It’s all about balance.

While ecosystems have all kinds of complex niches and bells and whistles, every “niche”, no matter how fast it is, or how big it is, is essentially based on:

1.  How much said species takes away from the land - how much it eats and how quickly it does so.
2.  How much it gives to the land - how much it reproduces and how quickly it does so.

However, only one species can occupy one niche (For long), because if a niche is disputed, one species will evolve and become superior to its competitor. Some species may be in competition, but not occupy the same niche - E.g. wolves and bears.

So, if there is a niche to be filled, a species will fill it. I’ve talked before about what happens when you remove a tier of the trophic pyramid, and in all possible scenarios (Except total extinction), no tier will remain vacant. (A trophic tier is basically a much broader, more simplified version of an ecological niche.)

Hundreds of millions of years ago, there were no carnivores. They hadn’t evolved at that stage. And in that time, there would have been a far smaller populations of herbivores, because if there were too many, they would exhaust the plant supply and go extinct. In ecology, there’s a rule called the 10% rule. It states that:

The biomass of consumers in an ecosystem must be equal to 10% of the biomass of its food source in that ecosystem.

But, when carnivores came along, the herbivore populations had to rise, because if they remained small in numbers, they would all be killed by predators. Basically, every creature in an ecosystem has a job to do in keeping the system balanced, by keeping numbers in check. To do this, they use the main criteria of a niche we spoke about: they take away from and they give to the land.
