## Why do Africa and Asia have so many giant animals compared to the rest of the world?

Let’s turn the clock back about 20,000 years or so. I’m now writing this answer under several kilometres of ice, in a world very different from our own. New Guinea isn’t an island, the Baltic Sea is more of a Baltic lake, and Tampa, Florida is a few hundred kilometres inland.

But, more important for our purposes, the wildlife of this planet is much different too. On the steppes of North America, one-tonne ground sloths live alongside mastodons and mammoths, bears as big as cows, and camels seven feet tall. In the skies, there are giant teratorns, and some of the largest ever felines prowl the prairies.

Closer to the equator, South America’s tropical savannas are home to spiky, car-sized armadillos, giant sloths much larger even than their northern cousins, and a wide variety of huge, hoofed mammals of unfamiliar orders like the litopterns and notoungulates.

Across the Pacific, in New Zealand, there are flightless birds standing three and a half metres tall, and one of the largest eagles ever to exist. In neighbouring Australia, you’ll find rhino-sized wombats, seven-metre long lizards, and spike-tailed turtles longer than you are tall.

Even Europe is a land of giants. In the regions not buried beneath the Eurasian ice sheet, there are elephants like woolly mammoths, and four species of rhinoceros. Among the carnivores are enormous bears, as well as leopards, lions and hyenas.

So, returning from our quick journey through time, it’s clear that - at one point - the rest of the world did have a wide variety of megafauna, wider even than those of Africa and Asia today. So, why have more giant animals survived in these continents?

Extinction is, fundamentally, always a result of change. The more rapid the change, the more widespread the extinction. When looking at the last 20,000 years, the main driver of change, unsurprisingly, has been one pesky, destructive species - Homo sapiens.

Africa, of course, is the continent where said species originated. The wildlife here has seen the gradual evolution of modern humans from earlier hominin species, and then the slow development of new hunting technologies over the millennia. As such, large animals in Africa have been the least effected by overhunting.

That’s not to say that there were no extinctions in Africa. Various giant antelope species (Megalotragus, Hippotragus gigas, etc.), the enormous buffalo Pelorovis, the Atlas bear, the Carthaginian elephant, the Mauritanian rhino, and the weird, wildebeest-like Rusingyoryx all fell victim to the Quaternary extinction event.

And that’s not to mention islands like the Canaries, Seychelles and Madagascar (pictured), which took much longer for humans to reach. Here, the faunal changes were as drastic as in most of the world.

But what about Asia? Humans migrated there, so why is it any different to Europe or North America? The answer - it seems - is that Homo sapiens colonized the southern part of Asia, Indo-Malaya (the part with all the megafauna) in several slow waves, starting as early as perhaps 125,000 years ago.

Because of this, the Asian wildlife had time to “warm up to” humans. Granted, places like northern Asia, Japan, the Philippines and Flores - which weren’t colonized till later - did experience drastic turnovers in large fauna, and even Indo-Malaya saw its fair share of extinctions…

Animals like the giant giraffe Sivatherium, pictured above, the Vietnamese orangutan, the eastern spotted hyena and a variety of bovines all went extinct in Southern Asia. Among the fallen here is the 22-ton elephant Palaeoloxodon namadicus, the largest-ever land mammal on record.

However, other giant animals - like the Asian elephant, Indian rhinoceros and water buffalo - have survived, because of the slow, pulsating way in which humans settled the Indo-Malayan region.

That being said, as technological advancement has accelerated, Africa and Asia have been subject to rapid change. Countless species here are on the brink. Unless we make an effort to conserve wildlife in these regions - in all regions, for that matter - they will share the same fate as the other continents.
