Other people might tell you that the world’s heaviest person was someone like Jon Brower Minnoch. They’re wrong - he only weighed 635 kilograms, after all. No, the true holder of the title is Henrietta Lacks, an African-American woman born in 1920.

Not as… well, bulky as you were expecting? Well, make no mistake; Henrietta weighs roughly 20 tons. Hear me out, it’ll all make sense soon enough.

On the 29th of January, 1951, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer. 10 days later, specialists at the hospital of Baltimore extracted some of the cancer cells. Unfortunately, Lacks died in October that year as a result of the cancer.

But there was something unusual about those cells they’d taken. Due to some fluke genetic mutation, the cancer cells had the ability to replicate, indefinitely, like living organisms. Each cell had 76–80 chromosomes of DNA.

They continued to reproduce for years, and in 1955 they were successfully cloned by scientists. The cancer cells continue to grow and reproduce to this day, and they’re used the world over as important test subjects for studies on cancer, viral resistance, and sensitivity to cosmetics.

They’ve become known as HeLa cells, after Henrietta Lacks. Technically, they’re still part of Lack’s body and in six decades, they’ve multiplied enough to have a collective weight of 20,000 kilograms.

Another interesting thing is that these cells, which could be seen as living things, have a different genome to Homo sapiens, despite being descended from a human. Because of that, some think they should be assigned a new scientific name, like Helacyton gartleri or perhaps Homo sapiens gartleri.

If they’re correct, that means that Homo sapiens has produced a daughter species, and the HeLa cells are the world’s first posthumans. Mankind has evolved… into cancer.
