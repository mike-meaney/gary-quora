Felidae.

The largest-ever Percrocutid was Dinocrocuta gigantea, which weighed in at a very impressive 300 kilograms.

There are currently three contenders for history's largest cats: Smilodon, Amphimachairodus and Xenosmilus, all pictured.

In any case, the largest of these are estimated to have weighed 400 kilograms or more, which significantly tops the largest of Percrocutids.

Edit: As Andrew Lee has pointed out, there is another possibility for the largest felid in history. One estimate for these put the range at 525 kilograms, but the more accepted upper estimate is 430.
