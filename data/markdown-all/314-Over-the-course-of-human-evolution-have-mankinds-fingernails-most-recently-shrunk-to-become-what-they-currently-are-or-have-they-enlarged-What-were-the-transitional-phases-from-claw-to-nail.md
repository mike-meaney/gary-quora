## Over the course of human evolution, have mankind's fingernails most recently shrunk to become what they currently are, or have they enlarged? What were the transitional phases from claw to nail?

Interesting question. I did some quick research and it seems chimpanzees have fingernails of varied length. This guy's are fairly short:

While this one's nails could do with a trim:

Ultimately, however, it seems pretty familiar, right? Well, just to be sure, I looked for a picture of the nails of a human in our species’ “natural state”. Behold, the fingers of a San bushman.

Again, more or less a negligible difference in length. So, I think we can conclude: there has been no significant hypertrophying or atrophying of the fingernails over the course of human evolution.

That was a weird answer.
