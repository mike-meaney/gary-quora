Neither of these animals are dinosaurs.

The armoured, ankylosaur-looking one is an aetosaur; a member of an extinct Triassic order of herbivorous suchians (relatives of crocodilians) which had interlocking osteoderm plates and, in some cases, extravagant spikes for protection.

The theropod-like red animal pursuing the aetosaur is another suchian, although in this case closer related to true crocodylomorphs - Postosuchus. Postosuchus and its cousins, collectively known as rauisuchids, independently evolved an upright stance and bipedal gait, much like the theropod dinosaurs.

Due to the laws of monophyly, there will never be actual members of the clade Dinosauria again, except for birds, which will always be birds. However, what these two Late Triassic suchians show is that convergent evolution can develop creatures very dinosaurian in body plan and appearance.

Perhaps hundreds of millions of years in the future, the Earth will be populated by dinosaur-like crocodiles, or dinosaur-like squamates, or dinosaur-like turtles, if only the selective pressures permit such an occurrence.
