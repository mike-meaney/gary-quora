When Paul becomes a sandrider, he says the worm he summons “appeared to be more than half a league long.” Half a league is about 2.8 kilometres! Using the proportions Wikipedia gives for sandworms (400 metres long and 40 wide, or 10:1), this worm would be around 280 metres in diameter.

Sandworms are roughly cylindrical, so this beast would have a volume of about 690 million cubic metres. They swim through sand, so I assume they would have to have a similar density to dry sand (so they don’t sink/float) - 1.6 kilograms per cubic metre.

This gives us a weight of about 1.1 million tonnes for Paul’s worm, or ten thousand blue whales. I know not enough of physics and biomechanics to discuss the structural feasibility of such a goliath, but one thing I will talk about is food. Herbert says that the sandworms feed on underground “sand-plankton”, as a blue whale would on krill.

It’s possible to estimate the metabolic rate (i.e. the amount of kilocalories needed per day, ignoring periods of exertion) of an organism with the formula KM^0.75, where M is the mass and K is a constant which depends on the type of living thing.

As sandworms are aliens, we don’t know what their value of K is, so I’ll go with a conservative 10 (equivalent to a typical invertebrate). Plugging in the figures, we conclude that the worm Paul rode would have a basal metabolic rate of roughly 340,000 kilocalories per day \- which is actually surprisingly low:

As you can see, a blue whale needs over four times as many calories, due to being a warm-blooded placental mammal. Even if our estimation is way off, we've got a plenty wide margin of error to still end up with a plausible organism.

Despite little being known about sandworms, and even less about sand plankton, I think that we can safely say that the nutritional needs of a billion-kilogram filter-feeder aren't a big stretch of the imagination. Other aspects of sandworm biology, however, may be a very different story…

EDIT: Embarrassingly, I've slipped a digit or two. I plugged in 1.1 million instead of 1.1 billion for the mass, and it turns out that dry sand actually weighs 1,600 kilograms per cubic metre.

So it really should have a daily caloric requirement of an absolutely ridiculous 340 billion kilocalories, or 200,000 times that of a blue fricking whale. Now I'm a lot more doubtful. Now I think it’s safe to conclude that sandworms are not possible.
