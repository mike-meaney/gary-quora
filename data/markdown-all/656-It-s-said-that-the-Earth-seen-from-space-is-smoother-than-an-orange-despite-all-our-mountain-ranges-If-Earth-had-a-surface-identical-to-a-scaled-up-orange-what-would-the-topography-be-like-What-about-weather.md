## It's said that the Earth seen from space is smoother than an orange, despite all our mountain ranges. If Earth had a surface identical to a scaled-up orange, what would the topography be like? What about weather, mountains, bodies of water, etc.?

Well, you certainly have a good imagination. You know those little tiny depressions you see on the surface of orange peels, and other citrus fruits? Those are trichomes, or “zest cells”, specialized epidermal structures which secrete oils.

As such, perhaps the land would be pockmarked with round lakes. They might look something like Mexican [cenotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote "en.wikipedia.org"), only much more densely distributed, and probably deeper too.

A fun fact you might have heard is that if you scaled the Earth down to the size of a ping pong ball, it would feel even smoother than a ping pong ball. Even Mount Everest would not register on your fingertips.

An orange is much less smooth than a ping pong ball, so presumably it would have deeper oceans and higher peaks, although the mountains, I imagine, would have very shallow slopes. All in all, however, I don’t think that an orange planet would be all that different to Earth; the trichome-lakes would probably be the biggest difference.
