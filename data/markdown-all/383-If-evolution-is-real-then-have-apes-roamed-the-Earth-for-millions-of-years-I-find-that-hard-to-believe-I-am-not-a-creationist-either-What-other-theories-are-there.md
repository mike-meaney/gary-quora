## If evolution is real, then have apes roamed the Earth for millions of years? I find that hard to believe. I am not a creationist either. What other theories are there?

Rukwapithecus fleaglei is clearly an ape and has all the physical and anatomical requirements to fall into the ape group. Its fossils have been objectively, scientifically dated to have died 25 million years ago.

That apes have roamed the Earth for millions of years is an irrefutable scientific fact. Heck, some modern species of ape were around millions of years ago - chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, emerged around 4 million years ago.

A million years is a long, long time, I’ll give you that. The human brain is incapable of even comprehending the concept of one million things. However, that’s just the way it is - deep time is, well, deep, and we can prove it.

If you mean alternate theories, as in scientific theories, or even hypotheses based on evidence, the answer is no. I’m afraid that evolution’s a fact, regardless of how unintuitive you might find it.
