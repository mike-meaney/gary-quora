People usually have a fair idea of the size of most large land animals, because it’s much easier to judge size when there are objects in the background. Not all of them (moose and elephant seals come to mind), but the majority, I’d say.

In the ocean, however, there is no backdrop except endless blue. Unless there’s a diver in the frame for scale, we tend to assume that many marine animals are smaller than they actually are - similar in size to the average land-dwelling creature.

Nonetheless, the buoyancy of water allows animals in the sea to become very large without having to support much of their own weight. Here are some oceangoing species which are probably larger than you realized.

*   Manta rays, which have a wingspan of up to about 9 metres and can weigh as much as 2.4 metric tonnes.

*   Leatherback sea turtles, the world’s fourth-largest reptiles, which can reportedly reach a maximum size of 932 kilograms.

*   Lion’s mane jellyfish, the largest specimen of which had 37 metre long tentacles. Its weight of 150 kg was very impressive considering it’s made of translucent jelly.

*   Giant oarfish, possibly measuring up to 11 metres in length. It’s the world’s longest bony fish and may have inspired sea serpent mythology.

*   Japanese spider crabs. They can be much, much larger than the one in the photo, measuring nearly 4 metres across.

*   Giant Pacific octopuses, which (at up to 71 kg) can weigh as much as a typical person - and that’s without any bones. One specimen caught in 1945 was possibly over 180 kilos!

*   Basking sharks, which, at over 12 metres max, can grow nearly as long as the more famous whale sharks.

*   Sunfish, which are the world’s largest bony fish. There are several huge species, but the largest, the ocean sunfish, can weigh as much as a small car.

*   Sturgeons. The largest species, the beluga sturgeon, is one of the longest and heaviest bony fish in the world, and one of the largest predatory fish. It can measure over 7 metres long, and weigh nearly 1.6 tonnes!

*   Conger eels, the largest known specimen of which was caught off Great Britain in 2015. It weighed 59 kilograms.

*   Atlantic cod \- we’ve all eaten them, but not many know that they can grow to be 2 metres long.

*   Marlins, another well-known food fish. Several species can reach up to 5 metres long, and weigh over 1,000 kg. Their close relatives the tuna and swordfish are also unexpectedly huge.

*   Halibut, the biggest of the flatfish. One freak specimen measured 3 metres long and weighed over 360 kg.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dce19b548600b802cd0b135b22b2870c-lq)

*   Catfish, of which there are a handful of gigantic species. The Mekong giant catfish, giant pangasius, Wels catfish and goliath catfish can all exceed 3 metres in length.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3629d172d9e4cce84d63c31bf04a7e95-lq)

*   The bootlace worm. It’s not a very well-known species, but I still think it deserves inclusion, since it can reportedly reach lengths of 55 metres!

I should add, none of the photos above (except for the conger eel’s) show the actual largest specimen ever recorded. Exceptionally huge individuals are very rarely encountered, and becoming ever-rarer, so there aren’t any photos of most of them.

Anyway, thanks for looking at a list of big fish with me, I hope you enjoyed the answer.
