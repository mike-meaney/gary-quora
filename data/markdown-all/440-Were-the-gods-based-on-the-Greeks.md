No. This isn’t my field of expertise but I at least know the answer.

From what I’ve researched, Greek religion in the form you’re likely talking about was around in Archaic Greece, which began in the eighth century BC. Then again, Poseidon was worshipped by the Mycenaeans, so let’s push the date back to 1450 BC. This is probably being generous, but it’ll do to illustrate the point.

The earliest example of a possible god might be the Löwenmensch figurine, or lion-man. This German statuette is 38,000 years old and shaped like a man with the head of an extinct cave lion - Wikipedia says “it may have represented a deity”. Yes, it was zoomorphic, but it still very much looked like a human.

Venus figurines are another very early example of what may have been deities - the oldest one, the Venus of Hohle Fels, is 35,000 years old. It clearly depicts a woman, and it’s been suggested that these statuettes represented some kind of “mother goddess”.

Skipping ahead to the 10th millennium BC, there’s the temple of Göbekli Tepe, the earliest known religious building. Carved on the side of some of the temple’s T-shaped pillars are anthropomorphic, possibly godly beings.

Then, in 7500 BC, the Anatolian proto-city of Çatalhöyük was built. In it we’ve unearthed many, many figurines, most of them female, which almost certainly represent gods and goddesses. The female figurines are remarkably similar to the Venus ones I mentioned earlier.

Around 4500 BC, the civilization of Sumer emerges. The ancient Sumerians had a religion of their own, with a pantheon of named gods. The earliest Sumerian religious texts describe four main deities - An, Enlil, Ninhursag, and Enki. All of them were anthropomorphic and looked perfectly human.

The Indus Valley Civilization began in 3300 BC, and they definitely worshipped gods and goddesses. One Indus valley seal, the Pashupati seal, depicts a three-headed god surrounded by animals.

Then, of course, there’s the Ancient Egyptian religion. Ancient Egypt first coalesced from prehistoric Egyptian cultures in 3100 BC, but the civilization’s religion is thought to have begun earlier. Again, while Egyptian deities did have animal traits, I still think they qualify as looking like humans.

Around about 1500 BC, Hinduism’s Vedic period begins, with many deities, most of them which do indeed look like humans. Among them are Indra, Soma, Varuna, Surya, Vaya, Prithivi and Aryaman.

Around about the same time, there was Minoan religion in Crete, famous for its ritual of bull-leaping. The various Minoan gods include Rhea, the earth mother goddess, Posidaeja, the goddess of the sea, and Therasia, sky goddess.

And all this before the Greeks. The history of anthropomorphic deities goes back more than 37,000 years before Ancient Greece ever emerged.
