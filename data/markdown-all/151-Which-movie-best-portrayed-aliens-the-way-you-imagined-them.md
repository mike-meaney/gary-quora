The ones which are designed to be plausible, rather than just entertaining.

The most popular example of such a film is Alien Planet, an adaptation of the much more detailed (and in my opinion, quite a bit better) book Expedition by the incredible Wayne D. Barlowe.

The docufiction followed two drones as they navigated an extrasolar planet, Darwin IV, encountering many alien life forms - all created by Barlowe. He designed them to look like nothing seen on Earth, which is just what aliens would be in real life.

Here are some illustrations (also by Wayne Barlowe) from his book, which I think are much more beautiful than the film’s CGI aliens.

There were some points which I would criticize in terms of plausibility. Mainly, the animals didn’t seem to be related; they were all extremely different as if they themselves hailed from many different planets.

However, the book was extremely innovative in how it portrayed alien life, and the movie of course also embodied that innovation.

There are other similar speculative docufiction films. The oldest I know of is Disney’s Mars and Beyond, which was way ahead of its time in terms of the alienness of its aliens. Some of the concepts were implausible, I think, like flora that used sonic weapons (that wouldn’t work in air, especially Mars’ thin air).

Then there’s Natural History of an Alien, a documentary exploring what alien life might be like. It was broadcasted in 1997, to celebrate the launch of the Pathfinder spacecraft. Don’t get your hopes up for the CGI effects, it was 1997 after all.

Cosmic Safari, released in 1999, was very like Natural History of an Alien in its premise and such, although it was more technical and had input and opinions from scientists of various fields, like Alien Planet.

The most recent one I haven’t yet mentioned is Extraterrestrial. I actually really enjoyed this miniseries; it focuses on two worlds, called Aurelia and the Blue Moon. The former is a tidally locked planet, while the latter is a dense-atmosphered moon of a gas giant. It actually found a way to break the maximum height of tree-like flora by catching water from above rather than pumping it up from the ground.

All of these documentaries are available on YouTube, but I probably shouldn’t link them here. Enjoy.
