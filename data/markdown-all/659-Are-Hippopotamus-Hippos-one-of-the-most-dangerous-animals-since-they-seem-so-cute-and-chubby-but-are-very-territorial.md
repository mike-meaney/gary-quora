As this video demonstrates, hippos are not always cute:

What it does, however, demonstrate, is that they certainly are territorial. Also, they’re not really “chubby” - they have only a thin layer of subcutaneous fat, their short legs (which are adapted for swimming) make them look much dumpier than they are in reality.
