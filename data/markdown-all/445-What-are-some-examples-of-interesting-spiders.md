Oh, where to start…

I’m of the opinion that, as a group, spiders don’t get nearly enough attention as they deserve. Of the 48,000 spider species, there are handfuls of mind-blowingly fascinating species. Here are some of my favourites.

Peacock spiders. The males in this genus are famous for the iridescent hues of their abdomen, often accompanied by extravagant bristles. Much like their feathered namesake, this is used for sexual display, or attracting females. The colours are not produced by pigments, but rather by microscopic reflective structures in their scales.

Other spiders have different methods of winning over potential suitors. The recently discovered Jotus remus, found in southeastern Australia, has a feathery paddle on two of its legs. While courting females, it hides behind a leaf and waggles this fan seductively at her.

The display features of long-horned orb-weavers are more mysterious. The females of this species have a pair of impressive spines curving up from their abdomen. Their purpose isn’t really known, but it could be for sexual selection, territorial display, or an anti-predator adaptation.

However, what’s even more interesting are how certain spiders catch their prey. Take, for example, the trapdoor spiders of Africa and Eurasia. Using specially adapted digging mouthparts, they create burrows and cap them with a camouflaged trapdoor.

When prey on the surface treads on one of the countless silk tripwires outside the burrow, the trapdoor spider leaps out and drags it back under the ground.

Then there are the amazing fishing spiders. These amphibious arachnids have a coat of long hairs which allow them to literally walk on water, as well as trapping a layer of air around them when they go underwater.

As their name suggests, fishing spiders feed on aquatic prey, including fish. In the night they lie in wait by the water’s edge, and are able to tackle fish 5 times their size using muscular, thickset limbs.

Even more extreme is Darwin’s bark spider, found only in Madagascar. This orb-weaver spins immense, 25 metre-wide webs across rivers and lakes. To do this, it produces the toughest biological material known to man, silk which is 10 times stronger than Kevlar, per unit area.

The webs, which are the largest orb webs in the world, are built over open water - an environment where no other spiders can compete with them. It was not discovered by Charles Darwin, but was named in his honour as it was described on the 150th anniversary of his Origin.

Another one of Madagascar’s many incredible arthropods is Olios coenobitus. This species is known for the unique way in which it constructs its home; it uses its silk to hoist an empty snail shell off the ground, and lives there, suspended from a branch. Unfortunately, it is still quite poorly-studied.

Portia is a genus of jumping spiders which, while outwardly unremarkable, has evolved highly complex, even “intelligent” behaviour. While on the hunt, Portia spiders may take an hour-long detour to find the best angle of attack on their prey. They adapt their hunting tactics to the different species they feed on (other spiders, mainly).

When hunting web-weaving spiders, they often deliberately trip the web’s line to lure the victim into approaching. Against other jumping spiders, which have excellent vision, they imitate forest floor detritus. Sometimes, they leap around randomly in order to cause their prey to react, giving away its position.

One of the most formidable animals that Portia is known to tackle are the spitting spiders. Except for the polar regions, this family is found virtually everywhere, but is nevertheless underrated.

To kill their prey, these spiders spit two zig-zagging strands of fluid from their mouthparts. This fluid is a blend of venom, which speeds up the victim’s death, and silk, which forms a sticky net to trap it.

One spider, on the other hand, has nearly done away with this “prey” business altogether; Bagheera kiplingi. Native to the forests of Central America, this jumping spider is in fact a herbivore; over 90% of its diet is plant matter.

It mainly eats Beltian bodies - little yellow buds of nutrients which some trees produce to attract ants. These ants get food and shelter by inhabiting the trees, while the tree gets protection from creatures which could damage it.

Speaking of ants, ant-mimicking spiders are something which have evolved independently quite a few times. Usually jumping spiders, they imitate the appearance and behaviour of specific local ant species to scare off potential predators.

These spiders have a pinched waist, ant-like eyes, and they even lift up their front legs to mimic antennae. Some have bulbous “heads” on the end of their mouthparts with false eyes on them. As they usually live among the ants they mimic, they have to be careful not to be found out by the insects, as the ants might attack an impostor.

The bird-dung crab spider of Southeast Asia is perhaps an even cleverer mimic. To camouflage itself from its unsuspecting prey, this spider has an incredible resemblance to bird droppings. Its skin is brownish-white, and glossy, giving it a “moist” sheen, and covered in random nodules and lumps.

They sit motionless in a messy smear of silk to complete the look. The most fascinating part, however, is that they even smell like bird droppings, making this a very rare case of an animal mimicking the smell of something else.

While we’re on the topic of spiders luring prey in with a scent, I must mention bolas spiders. Some of these also imitate bird dung, while others resemble snail shells, like the one below. As they lie in wait, the smell they emanate mimics that of moth pheromones.

Rather than constructing a web, bolas spiders simply have a sticky gobbet of silk dangling from one of their legs; a bolas. The glob is a complex, multi-layered concoction perfectly engineered to adhere to prey. When their odour attracts a moth, the spider swings the bolas, ensnares the insect and reels it in.

What’s more, there’s yet another group of spiders which camouflage themselves as bird droppings - trashline orbweavers. Some of them spin a patch of white silk fabric in the centre of their webs, before adding chunks of dead leaves, to make something with a striking resemblance to bird dung.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-879394ea73ca52b8b2d6f4a095561a9f-lq)

Better yet, other trashline orbweavers use leaves, twigs and even their own skin to make a much bigger and more intimidating “spider” on their web:

There are also some which make these strange spiral patterns out of silk.

Moving on, let’s look at a concept which would terrify some; social spiders. There are around 25 species, which congegrate in massive groups of up to 50,000. These armies live in the world’s largest spider webs, which can be big enough to smother entire trees.

Group-living has several advantages for spiders. They can swarm large prey which gets caught in the silk, take care of each other’s young, and make short work of web maintenance. The last of the three is especially important, since many social spiders live in rainforests where precipitation constantly damages spider webs.

The scorpion-tailed spider may sound like another horrifying arachnid, but thankfully this isn’t the case. The females are brightly coloured and have a long, spiked tail, not unlike that of a scorpion. However, they have no stinger, and their bite is harmful only to insects.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-011c0281a21346a8871a77f829f6b174-lq)

One spider which is definitely more heartwarming than horrifying is Toxeus magnus. This is a Chinese species of ant-mimicking spider, and a rare example of parental care in arthropods. Mother T. magnus secrete a nutritious fluid which their young need to survive; essentially the same concept as milk in us mammals.

The spiderlings lap up the “milk” from a furrow underneath their abdomen, and die within 10 days without it. This discovery was only published in 2018 (on this very date, coincidentally), and as far as I’m aware, it’s the only known occurrence of a non-mammal animal “lactating”, except for the birds which produce crop milk.

This answer is really getting long by now, so I’ll go over seven more lovely spiders and wrap things up. First, let’s look at the fascinating diving bell spider. This species lives almost its entire life underwater, hunting, mating and sleeping below the surface.

A coat of hydrophobic hairs trap a silvery layer of oxygen around them, essentially forming a biological SCUBA tank. Even more amazing are their bell-shaped webs, pictured, which are made of silk and some unknown kind of gel. The spiders inflate these with air from the surface, and the silk allows gas exchange to occur.

Spiders have not only conquered the land and water, but also the air. Selenops (or the “spider glider”, as I like to call it) has an incredibly flattened body which allows it to glide and even maneuvre mid-air. This allows them to cover long distances in the forest canopy.

If you’re arachnophobic (and somehow haven’t stopped reading long before this) and thought that this was bad enough, beware that Selenops is agile on land too, and can turn or pivot faster than virtually any other land animal known.

While we’re on the topic of strange locomotion, I have to talk a bit about the wheel spider of Africa’s Namib Desert. If attacked by a pompilid (spider-hunting wasp), it escapes by turning on its side and simply cartwheeling down the sand dune at a speed of 1 metre per second.

Wheel spiders are really only vulnerable to attack while they dig their underground nests. They have to shift around 16 kg of sand to do this, which, relative to their size, is like a human shoveling 5,600 tonnes.

Two more to go. First, there's the spiders in the genus Cyrtarachne. Beneath a thin, translucent membrane, their abdomen produces vibrant pulses of colour in mesmerising swirls. Why? As of now, we do not know.

The bulk of the documentation on this phenomenon has been by Singaporean photographer Nicky Bay, who has many spectacular captures online, and so far no actual scientific research has been conducted on these species.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-62346300a53fada705277d71f008fb6e-pjlq)

They're not the only dazzling spiders out there. The mirror spiders of Australia have countless platelets on their abdomens, made of highly reflective guanine. They can even contract and expand the plates at will.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-80bbfcb9d1cea245162453e1b7ea375f-pjlq)

Meanwhile, the flower crab spider can change colour to blend in with its environment. When they perch on pale flowers, they assume a white hue. However, if they move to a yellow flower they secrete yellow pigment into their skin cells and change colour.

Interestingly enough, they sometimes also change shades based on what they've eaten. Certain prey cause this crab spider to turn pink, brown, green or orange.

For my last taxon, I will introduce you to the pelican spiders. Also known as assassin spiders, this family is found in southern Africa and Australia. They are an ancient group dating back to Jurassic times.

To strike their prey from a distance, pelican/assassin spiders have evolved a very long neck and elongated jaws, hence the names. They impale their victims on these jaws, envenom them, and then take them into their mouth, which is actually below the neck.

I could go on, and on… and on, but alas, I think 26 spidery friends is enough for one answer. I don't want to lose all my arachnophobic followers, after all. Thanks for sticking around all the way, I really hope you've enjoyed.
