Hatchlings would be a universal term.

“Chicks” is also used when describing the young of theropods, and of course birds themselves.

“Calf” is a recognized, and fairly widely used, word for the young of sauropods and non-saurischian herbivores. I’ve also heard “fawn” being used from time to time, but not much.

Of course, there are more specific terms for avian dinosaurs, such as nestling, fledgling, cygnet, gosling, ducking, puffling, eaglet, owlet, and peachick.
