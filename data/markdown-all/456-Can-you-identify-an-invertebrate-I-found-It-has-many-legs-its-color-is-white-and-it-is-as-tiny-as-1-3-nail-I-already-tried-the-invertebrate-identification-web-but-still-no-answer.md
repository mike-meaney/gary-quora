## Can you identify an invertebrate I found? It has many legs, its color is white, and it is as tiny as 1/3 nail. I already tried the invertebrate identification web, but still no answer.

I zoomed in on your image, and to be honest I slightly doubt that that’s an organism you’ve got there, or at least an arthropod.

There’s no regularity to the legs, no discernible symmetry, segmentation etc. However, I found an image vaguely similar online:

This is a larva of the predatory beetle Cryptolaemus sp., also known amusingly as the “mealybug destroyer”. If this is your creature, the legs are not legs at all but fuzzy projections on the larva.
