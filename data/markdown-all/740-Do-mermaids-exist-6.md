No.

First of all, apes are mammals. That means they need to breathe air and would’ve been seen countless times when they surface.

Secondly, apes are social. If they’re social, that means that they have to communicate, and they’d do so with vocalizations; these vocalizations would be heard by humans or by technological equipment.
