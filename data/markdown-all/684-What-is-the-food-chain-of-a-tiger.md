Tigers are apex predators, so they have no natural predators when they’re fully grown (Some tenacious leopards may kill a tiger cub or two, however.).

The food chain in a tiger’s environment would go something like this:

Tiger (Tertiary consumer) ← Leopard/Bear (Secondary consumer) ← Deer/Boar/Monkey (Primary consumer) ← Plants ← Sunlight
