During the Pleistocene, a lot of ocean water was locked up as ice in the polar regions, so sea levels were significantly lower than they are today. This meant that England was connected to mainland Europe - forming a landmass called Doggerland.

This meant that it was easier for large megafauna to colonize the area, and so Britain had a lot more megafaunal wildlife. In particular, it seems to have been a haven for bears - mega bears.

Cave bears, Ursus spelaeus were huge - males averaged at around 350–600 kg, occasionally climbing to a ton. They were quite sexually dimorphic and females were less than half the males’ size, generally. It wasn’t a carnivore, though - it was evidently largely a plant-eater, but ate animal food every now and then.

The bear on the right of the illustration is a so-called “tyrant polar bear”, Ursus maritimus tyrannus. Though a subspecies of the polar bear, it was markedly larger than its modern counterparts and perhaps one of the largest ever land mammal carnivores. So weird to think that London was once home to polar bears.

A more obscure type of Pleistocene British bear is Ursus arctos priscus, a subspecies of the extant grizzly bear. It was larger than even the largest of modern Kodiak bears, and probably bigger than cave bears too. Not only that, but it was no omnivore like a modern grizzly - it was evidently hypercarnivorous.

As well as its bears, Pleistocene/Paleolithic England had all kinds of other megafauna. In terms of herbivores, there were mammoths, elephants, woolly rhinos, giant deer of several species, and even hippopotami! There were plenty of carnivores too - hyenas, lynxes, lions, leopards, and wolves - including a brawny extinct variety called the megafaunal wolf (see [this answer](https://www.quora.com/Did-Pleistocene-Europe-have-an-apex-canid-predator-like-North-Americas-dire-wolf/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")).

Sounds cool, right? I’m convinced that humans have made the world objectively way less awesome through their overhunting and exploitation.
