## Would a T-Rex or Giganotosaurus be able to lift an elephant clenched in its jaws?

It depends on exactly what you mean. There are three living species of elephant; from biggest to smallest, they are the African savanna elephant, Asian elephant, and the African forest elephant.

At birth, African forest elephants weigh about 105 kilograms, which a Tyrannosaurus rex or Giganotosaurus carolinii would likely have no trouble with. However, if you’re only talking about adult elephants, things get a little more complicated.

When fully grown, forest elephant cows can weigh as “little” as 2,000 kilograms. Let’s go with that figure. However, the answer to the question still depends on what you mean by “lift”.

The paleontologist Donald M. Henderson has already done some research which will be of great importance to us, here: [Balance and Strength—Estimating the Maximum Prey‐Lifting Potential of the Large Predatory Dinosaur Carcharodontosaurus saharicus](https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ar.23164 "anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com"). His paper was inspired by a piece of paleoart titled “Double Death”:

It depicts a pair of Carcharodontosaurus saharicus, closely related to Giganotosaurus, lifting up a rebacchisaurid sauropod. Henderson calculated that if one C. saharicus held an object in its jaws weighing up to 2,500 kilograms, its centre of gravity would still be above the feet and thus it would not lose balance.

If that’s what you meant by “lift”, then yes, a T. rex or G. carolinii would most likely rise to the challenge. However, actually raising the object up to head height is another matter altogether. According to Henderson, a Carcharodontosaurus could “only” manage to do this to objects weighing 424 kilograms and under.

Granted, that paper applies only to Carcharodontosaurus, and Tyrannosaurus rex was a much, much more powerful animal. Both its jaw and neck muscles were far more robust than any carcharodontosaurid.

I did some more digging and found this paper: [Craniocervical feeding dynamics of Tyrannosaurus rex](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228627618_Craniocervical_feeding_dynamics_of_Tyrannosaurus_rex "www.researchgate.net"). Many of it’s findings are frankly quite terrifying (for example, it concluded that a Tyrannosaurus could toss a 50 kg object, a.k.a. a small-ish teenager, 5 metres into the air), and its research indicates that the theropod could hold 1,014 kilograms in a neutral position.

Unfortunately for our purposes, that’s no fully grown elephant, but it is a fricking car, so the moral of the story: T. rex was an absolute badass.
