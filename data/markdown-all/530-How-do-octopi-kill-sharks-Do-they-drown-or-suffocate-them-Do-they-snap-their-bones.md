As far as I know, octopuses (fun fact - octopuses, or octopodes, is the correct plural of octopus) have never been known to actually kill sharks, only deter them.

As you can see in this still from Blue Planet II, the octopus sticks its tentacles into the shark’s gills so that it can’t breathe. The shark - in this case a pyjama shark Poroderma africanum - is still well able to wrestle free of the octopus’ grip, but it won’t be returning any time soon.
