The largest known animal from the Paleozoic era is, to my knowledge, Dunkleosteus terrelli, an enormous predatory fish weighing four metric tons.

It doesn’t look that heavy at first, being only 6 metres, but its armour plating would have weighed it down a lot. It belonged to an extinct class of jawed fish called placoderms which had bony armor covering their head and thorax.

A close relative of Dunkleosteus, Titanichthys, about the same size, was actually likely a filter-feeder rather than an active predator.

There were other giant fish swimming around in the Paleozoic era. Helicoprion, the whorl-toothed shark (technically it was a eugeneodontidan, but that’s a mouthful and it was a shark relative), 12 metres long and weighing 1 ton.

Some sharks of the extinct group called the Ctenacanthiformes outsized the modern great whites, and there was a species of frilled shark which grew to over six metres long, Chlamydoselachus goliath.

In the Permian, there were many large land animals. The largest I am aware of is the powerful therocephalian Anteosaurus. Upper estimates put this carnivore at 600 kilograms in weight.

In close second there’s the ridiculous-looking pelycosaur Cotylorhynchus, which weighed 500 kilograms. Look at its tiny head.

So there you have it. There were some Triassic animals I was hoping would make the list, like Fasolasuchus and Lisowicia, but they were just about contemporaneous with early dinosaurs.

EDIT: I just realized, there are two more animals which have to be on this list - first, Inostrancevia. Inostrancevia was a gorgonopsian, a type of predatory therapsid adapted for running down prey. Gorgonopsians were the first lineage of predators to develop saber-teeth.

The largest of them was Inostrancevia, which was huge - it weighed a ton, more than twice the mass of a polar bear.

The animal its eating is a Scutosaurus, an armoured reptile formerly thought to be an early turtle relative. It was just as heavy as Inostrancevia and was covered in bony scutes, hence the name.
