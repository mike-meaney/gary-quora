## What do we know about the first inhabitants of South America 15,000 or 20,000 years ago or more? What language did they speak? What were they look physically?

Short answer - possibly nothing like modern South American natives.

Long answer - to the best of my knowledge, the earliest human fossil from South America whose life appearance has been reconstructed is the 11,500 year-old Luzia woman, from Eastern Brazil.

In 1974, this woman’s skull and fragmented skeleton were unearthed near the large city of Belo Horizonte, remains which were once thought to have been lost in the recent tragic fire at the National Museum of Brazil. Miraculously, however, they were recovered.

She was about 20 when she died, perhaps at the hand of a dangerous animal, and stood less than five feet tall. She’s thought to have been a member of a band of hunters, and was named Luzia in honour of the famous Lucy.

Facial reconstructions show that this person had some surprising features in life. Her head would have been narrow and ovular, and her chin prominent. Here’s an alternative reconstruction:

So, as you can see, Luzia was probably very different from your typical modern Amerindian. Rather, she had characteristics more in line with, say, Aboriginal Australians:

Melanesians (natives of New Guinea, Fiji, Vanuatu and so on):

Or the Negritos of the Andaman Islands, Thailand and mainland Malaysia.

Is it possible that Luzia and her people were, genetically, Austronesians? Despite appearances, this is highly unlikely, as DNA analyses strongly suggest that she’s a true Amerindian - just one with features much different to modern indigenous Americans.

Whether her people were as anomalous in their day is much less easy to discern. Granted, some human fossils from North America pre-date Luzia and had typical Native American features, such as “Eva de Naharon”, a Mexican woman from 13,600 years ago.

Granted, her features might suggest Southern Asian ancestry rather than Siberian, but that’s a whole different can of worms and her features were still broadly Amerindian.

Another example from around 13,500 years ago is the “Señora de Las Palmas”, also from Mexico.

Nevertheless, it's quite possible that some of the earliest South Americans were like Luzia, and very different from what you'd expect. As for what language they spoke, we may never know…
