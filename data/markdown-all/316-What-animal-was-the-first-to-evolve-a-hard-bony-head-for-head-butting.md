## What animal was the first to evolve a hard bony head for head butting?

The adaptation you’re talking about is called pachyostosis: the thickening and densifying of bone. Many seagoing creatures have pachyostosis in their chest, the heavy mass of bone serving to counter the pull of the buoyant lungs. However, in land animals, pachyostosis is usually used to fortify the head for head-butting tests.

Surprisingly, this feature has been around almost as long as large, land-dwelling wildlife has in general. The Permian period marked the beginning of the reign of amniotes (reptiles, mammals, birds and their relatives) on land, a reign which continues to this day.

Likewise, the Permian was the first time that animals started slamming headfirst into each other…

So, to answer your question, Anteosaurus was the earliest head-butter we know of. This powerful therapsid roamed Southern Africa 266 million years ago, and would surely have been an apex predator in its environment. Anteosaurus was huge, weighing up to 600 kg - in fact, before the rise of the dinosaurs, it was the second-largest known land carnivore of all time.

The skull of this animal was not only huge (at 80 cm in length), it was extremely thick. Thus, it’s thought that the males would have head-butted or wrestled over territory and mates.

Around the same time - 265 million years ago, specifically - another group of therapsids (early cousins of mammals) developed pachyostosis - the tapinocephalids. They, however, were sturdily built herbivores, not predators. The most well-known species was Moschops, which was in fact probable prey of Anteosaurus.

Some of its brethren, such as Ulemosaurus and especially Tapinocephalus, had even thicker, more prominent domes on their skulls. The latter, which may have weighed up to 2,000 kg, was certainly not the kind of animal I’d like to find myself slamming my head into.

The next possible head-butting creatures I’m aware of popped up not too long after Anteosaurus and the tapinocephalids - the burnetiids. This was yet another family of therapsids which evolved around 260 million years ago, and consisted of a handful of small, agile carnivorous species.

The burnetiids share a common characteristic - a striking array of strange lumps, or bosses, on the front of the head. These may have been for display purposes, but it is also indeed possible that they had a use in head-to-head combat between rival males. The species illustrated below is Burnetia, which yet again lived in South Africa.

So, those were all the ancient head-butters of the Permian. The period ended with the infamous P-T mass extinction, also known as the Great Dying - the most devastating blow the Earth’s biodiversity has ever been dealt. Up to three quarters of species on the planet were wiped out, and the therapsids lost their dominion over the land for the next 186 million years.

In their stead, reptiles became the most prevalent terrestrial wildlife. From the Triassic to the Cretaceous, the world was ruled by archosaurs. Sure enough, they soon produced a dome-headed warrior of their own - Triopticus.

Pachyostosis is clear in the skull of this 230 million year old reptile, which turned its head into a powerful battering ram. Triopticus gets its name from a little hole it had on its scalp, almost like a third eye socket. This may have been an opening from which the pineal gland secreted hormones.

That about summarizes all the pre-dinosaur species which we think may have had a fondness for head-on collisions. I could go into all the head-butting forms which came after these four - pachycephalosaurs, ceratopsians, titanotheres, and so on - but an answer can only go on so long, I suppose.

Thank you very much for reading, everybody, I hope you enjoyed, and have a great day.
