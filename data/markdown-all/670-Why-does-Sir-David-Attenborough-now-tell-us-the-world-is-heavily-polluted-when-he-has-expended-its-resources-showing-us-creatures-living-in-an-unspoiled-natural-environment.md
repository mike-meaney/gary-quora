## Why does Sir David Attenborough now tell us the world is heavily polluted when he has expended its resources showing us creatures living in an unspoiled natural environment?

His urges for us to take action against pollution are simply warnings, nobody’s making money out of them.

In contrast, documentaries need to sell well, and not as many people will watch them if they don’t paint a picture of pristineness.

David Attenborough doesn’t actively support this representation of the environment, the directors do it because they need to make money.
