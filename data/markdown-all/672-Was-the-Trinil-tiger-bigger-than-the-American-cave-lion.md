From Wikipedia:

> But now it is thought that it might have been a bit smaller than the Bengal tigers and similar to the [Indochinese tiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indochinese_tiger "en.wikipedia.org")'s size

So no, given that American lions were bigger than all extant big cats, it was not larger.
