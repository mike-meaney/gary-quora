As of 15 hours before the posting of this answer, 237,000 people have “confirmed” that they will be attending the event, with a further 265,000 people “interested”. Let’s assume that this is actually serious (which it isn’t), and all interested show up when the day comes.

Let’s examine our troops. We have approximately 502,000 people. The average American Facebook user is 40.5 years old, not exactly ideal for attacking a base in the baking desert, but I’m assuming most who signed up are a lot younger than that.

Allegedly, 29% of American adults own firearms - let’s raise that to a (rather conservative, actually) third given that the mob will probably have a male majority. That’s about 167,000 armed people, but most gun owners have multiple weapons so there’s probably enough for everyone.

Another thing to consider is that people will be bringing their personal vehicles. The vast majority of them will be unfit to brave the ~64 kilometers of rocky desert between the base and the nearest highway, but some of them will have off-road capabilities. Also, the group is so large, that the chances are one of them is rich enough to afford a bulletproof car:

And yes, they really are both available for civilians and street legal. ‘Murica. Now, whether or not a civilian armoured vehicle could withstand actual military firepower rather than just assassination attempts and the like is up for debate.

The first problem the horde will encounter is simply one of getting there. Half a million is an insanely huge amount of people, and the Biblical influx will probably see the most traffic on one road the US has ever seen.

Even if everyone carpools, it would be days and days after the first guy arrived that the last one did. By then, everyone would’ve either been told to go home or collapsed from heatstroke.

And that’s another thing to consider - this would likely be a humanitarian disaster on an unprecedented scale. Think about it - 502,000 young Americans, stranded in the middle of the Nevada desert, with no means of cooperating or coordinating themselves as a group. The military wouldn’t be deployed to fight them off, they’d be there to evacuate them.

Let’s handwave those problems, and pretend that the half-million could all get there on time and avoid starvation, thirst, heatstroke, sunburn, exhaustion and lack of shelter, without emergency aid. Do they have a fighting chance of infiltrating the base? Well… maybe.

One thing which is important to consider is that 502,000 people is enormous. For comparison, as of 2006 the entire Nevada National Guard contained 3,599 members. Granted, if things get serious, they’ll call in backup, at which point our forces will be doomed. So, the trick is to not let things get serious.

The deadliest day in US history was the Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17th 1862, when 23,000 soldiers were killed.

If the base was to open fire on half a million unarmed people, on American soil, and kill them all, the carnage would be over 20 times worse than Antietam. There is no way that whatever aliens or secret technology could be more terrible than the crippling media backlash the US military would receive. The charge would probably be being livestreamed by thousands, too, to make things worse.

So, if everyone conceals their firearms unless shot at, at least some could probably reach the gates without encountering lethal force. After that point… they’ve technically infiltrated the base (and would be arrested and quite possibly jailed), but they won’t be able to get far enough to see anything interesting, since at that point they’re like fish in a barrel and can be easily rounded up.
