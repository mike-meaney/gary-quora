It depends if you consider hematophagy (the consumption of blood) carnivory. There are a few different definitions of carnivorous, and some of them say it can only be considered carnivory if the animal eats flesh (meat.). Personally, I hold with those who say carnivores can be osteophages (bone-eaters), hematophages (blood-drinkers), parasites, etc.

Also, as explained in another answer, only the females are hematophages, while the males drink nectar.
