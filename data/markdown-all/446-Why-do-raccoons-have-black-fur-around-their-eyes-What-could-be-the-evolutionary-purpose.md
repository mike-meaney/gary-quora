It’s for the same reason that you see American footballers with eye black. The dark coloration reduces glare by absorbing light which would otherwise be reflected into the eye.

It’s cropped up many times in nature, most famously in the malar stripes of cheetahs:

As well as in the likes of bat-eared foxes:

And tanukis:

Lions, among other animals, have the opposite; they have pale fur around their eyes which reflects light into their eyes at night. This is because they are primarily nocturnal hunters, whereas the above creatures hunt during the day.

There are alternative hypotheses. Sam’s parasite idea isn’t half-bad; additionally, some animals have black coloration to highlight certain areas of their body.

For example, I’ve heard it said that oryxes have black bands to highlight their muscles, and Thomson’s gazelles have a black side stripe to make conspicuous the alarm gesture they do where they contract their sides to warn others.
