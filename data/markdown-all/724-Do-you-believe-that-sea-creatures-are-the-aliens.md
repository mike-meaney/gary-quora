What do you mean by aliens? If you you’re asking if I think that marine animals may have strangle, alien-like appearances, then…

Absolutely.

However, if you’re asking if I think marine animals are descended from life-forms on extraterrestrial planets, then no. Absolutely not.

While we may not understand the intricacies of taxonomic relations between animals, all scientists agree that all animals are related. They’re all low-temperature carbon-water based multicellular eukaryotic life forms, descended from colonial choanoflagellates, which reproduce using DNA and consume organic matter, breathe oxygen, and can move freely.
