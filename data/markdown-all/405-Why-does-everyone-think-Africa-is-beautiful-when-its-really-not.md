This isn’t beautiful.

Kibera, Nairobi

Neither is this.

Paris

So I guess the real question is, why do people think Paris is beautiful when it’s really not? And the answer to that question would be: there are uglier areas, but there are also many parts of the city that are beautiful, like this.

Those places are far more beautiful than most other European cities, so much so that people have come to think of the city as a beautiful place - which, for the most part, it is.

Similarly, there are parts of Africa which aren’t beautiful - just like anyplace - but just like Paris, there are parts which most definitely are. Except that Africa’s 300,000 times bigger than Paris, so there’s going to be even more variation.

Having been to Africa several times, I can confirm that there are slums, drab cities and tin shacks. However, I can also tell you that Africa contains, in my opinion, the most spectacular landscapes anywhere, and that it really is the most amazing place in the entire world. You can accept that are there are dodgy parts, but to truly see Africa for what it is, you must recognize that it is amazing.

In the words of Mahatma Gandhi,

> If a few drops in the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty

So, the bottom line is that Africa is beautiful. The presence of those few dirty drops does not spoil the beauty of the world’s second-largest landmass. Africa - home to amazing scenery and unique wildlife - is like nowhere else on Earth.
