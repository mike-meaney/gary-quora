There have been so few studies on king cheetahs that there’s no official data for this kind of thing, but I’d say that it’d have, if anything, disadvantages.

As you can see in the picture above - and supported by countless other photos, as well as my own firsthand observation - cheetahs are chiefly diurnal hunters on really, really open terrain, hence their cursorial habits. There are a few bush-living ones, but

First of all, let me just say that I don’t know why the hell cheetahs have spots in the first place. It’s probably just a result of their genetic bottleneck, but they’d be way better off if they were unmarked and tawny like lions.

The king cheetah mutation just gives them a lot more black. All that black stands out against the golden grass - especially during the day, when cheetahs hunt - and alerts the prey to the cheetah’s presence even sooner. Cheetahs are sprinters, not marathoners, so they need to get a decent proximity to their prey before they run.
