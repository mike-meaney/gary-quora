I believe it’s all in the forepaws. If you’ve ever seen a big cat take down its prey, they grab it’s neck, pull it down and bite its throat.

Felids have retractable claws and their forelegs are fairly mobile, almost like “arms”. That way, it’s much easier for them to kill their prey quickly, which also means that their canines are damaged less.

Canids (dogs) and hyenas lack retractable claws, flexible forelegs, but do have more robust canines. Their teeth are stronger, perhaps, because both families are better adapted for scavenging.

You may not have heard of them, but there is in fact an extinct tribe of canids called the Borophagines, or “bone-crushing dogs”. They have no felid equals, and are an example of how canids are better suited to scavenging and demolishing bone than felids.

And, obviously, hyenas are the best adapted scavenging mammals on the planet, so there’s no question there.

To summarize, my point is that dogs and hyenas are:

1.  Better suited to eating prey alive, and
2.  Not as good at killing prey quickly as cats.

This ultimately is a great way of showing the balance of evolution, how species unable to do something in one way will evolve traits to do it in another.
