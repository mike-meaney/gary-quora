Bottlenose dolphins have been observed agitating pufferfish, something which makes them secrete a slimy nerve toxin which, in small enough quantities, has a hallucogenic and narcotic effect.

The dolphins, after doing so, were observed to be in a trance-like state, which is presumably pleasurable for them. They were also seen to stare at their own reflections in the surface.

In a far less amusing incident, a chimpanzee called Travis - upon drinking tea which had been laced with the drug Xanax - attacked his owner, ripping off her jaw and hands, and blinding her for life.
