*   Hesperornithes
*   Halszkaraptor

*   Spinosaurus
*   Possibly Lurdusaurus
*   Maybe Liaoningosaurus, a kind of ankylosaur

*   Various pterosaurs
*   Crocodilians
*   Choristoderes

*   Turtles - sea turtles are fully marine
*   Sea snakes
*   All kinds of semi-aquatic serpents
*   Various monitor lizards

*   Marine iguanas
*   Several other lizard species
*   Pleurosaurus, an early tuatara

*   Thalattosaurs
*   Most amphibians
*   Families Telmatobiidae, Typhlonectidae and a few salamander families are fully aquatic amphibians

And that doesn’t include invertebrates, although a few I can think of are Odonate (dragonfly/damselfly) larvae, mayfly larvae, those Hawaiian amphibious caterpillars ([They’re really cool](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/amphibious-caterpillars "www.americanscientist.org")), diving beetles, diving bell spiders and water boatmen.

Most of the above list are semi-aquatic, but they still have aquatic adaptations and spend much of their lives in water. Many, nevertheless, are fully aquatic, like cetaceans, sirenians, plesiosaurs, icthyosaurs, mosasaurs, thalattosaurs, sea otters, and the amphibians in the last bullet.
