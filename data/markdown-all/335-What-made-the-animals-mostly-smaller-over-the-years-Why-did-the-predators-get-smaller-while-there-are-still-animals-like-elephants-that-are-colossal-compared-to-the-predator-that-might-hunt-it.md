## What made the animals mostly smaller over the years? Why did the predators get smaller while there are still animals like elephants that are colossal compared to the predator that might hunt it?

All the largest land predators of all time were theropod dinosaurs, and all the top 10 heaviest lived in the Cretaceous period. Why were they so big? Well, because their food was.

So then, the next question which follows is why don’t we have any such herbivores today? Among the main reasons is that the Earth is currently dominated by mammals, specifically therian mammals, which bear live young.

If you’re viviparous and want to be big, then you have to have big babies. There’s only so much you can squeeze out of a birth canal so mammals can only grow so big. If you’re like a sauropod, however, and lay eggs, then there’s no such problem.

Another thing - one of the “signature moves” of mammals is generally good intelligence and social skills. That’s why we do pack-hunting better than anybody else, and the thing about a pack is that the size of an individual member doesn’t need to be as close to the size of the prey.

In other words, the size of the pack is inversely proportional to the necessary size of the individual (assuming prey size stays the same). Why be an energy-expensive 18-ton monster when you can weigh 100 kilograms and team up with friends?

One last thing. There were some really bigass predators around very recently, in the last few tens of thousands of years. However, they’ve gone extinct, chiefly due to competition with that global pain in the neck, Homo sapiens.

Here are a few carnivores which lived in the Pleistocene epoch but were very recently wiped out.

*   Smilodon populator, max. 400 kg

*   Xenosmilus hodsonae, max. 300 kg

*   Arctodus sp., max. 957 kg

*   Tyrant polar bear, max. 1,000 kg

*   Arctotherium angustidens, max. 2,457 kg

*   Megalania (Varanus priscus), max. 1,945 kg

If the upper estimates are correct, all these predators would have been positively gigantic for their respective families. Some of them are dubious (especially the Arctotherium upper estimate), but still, it’s such a shame they’re gone.

So, as you can see, it’s quite a complex answer to your question. Mainly, though, it’s down to the three things I outlined.
