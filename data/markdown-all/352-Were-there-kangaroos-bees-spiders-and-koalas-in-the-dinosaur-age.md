There were certainly bees during the time of dinosaurs. The first plants with flowers appeared during this time, and they were pollinated by bees. The oldest known bee is 100 million years old, and it’s called Melittosphex burmensis, beautifully preserved in amber.

There were also spiders which lived alongside dinosaurs - in fact, spiders are even older than the dinosaurs. Here’s another amber fossil, one which has captured a moment in time as a prehistoric spider attacks a wasp.

On the other hand, there were no kangaroos in the dinosaur age - before the dinosaurs went extinct, most mammals looked very similar, like shrews or rats. However, there might have been some animals which looked kind of like kangaroos.

This is Schleromochlus, which was a close relative of the ancestors of the pterosaurs (your son might know them better as “pterodactyls”). It had long legs and a skeleton which suggests that it moved by hopping, like a kangaroo.

Similarly, there were no koalas in the time of dinosaurs. However, there were animals which had a similar role in the food chain. Drepanosaurs were koala- or sloth-like reptiles which lived in the trees and probably had a very similar lifestyle.
