I’ve been to Kenya a couple of times, and I’m by no means a local expert, but I’ve visited a fair share of its best national parks and reserves. All the photos below are from my trips there. I can wholeheartedly recommend these following destinations:

*   The Maasai Mara. If I could only go to one place on a Kenya trip, it would absolutely be here. The sweeping, open scenery is really unique, the Great Wildebeest Migration is a spectacle to behold, the local tribal culture is fascinating, and there are animals to be seen wherever you look.

*   Lake Nakuru. This lush and forested national park surrounds a huge, shallow lake. The misty, wooded environment is a stark contrast to Kenya’s typical arid landscape, and bird life is jaw-droppingly abundant. It’s also the only part of the country where you can see Rothschild’s giraffes.

*   Samburu National Reserve - easily one of the most scenic parts of the country. It’s hot, dry and dusty, but is located along the beautiful Ewaso N’giro River, which is fringed with doum palms. Due to its unique semi-desert climate, it has a ton of wildlife you can’t see elsewhere in Kenya.

*   The Ol Pejeta Conservancy. This area is famous for its rhinos, of both the black and white species. In fact, it’s home to the last two northern white rhinos on Earth, as well as a docile (but blind) black rhino which you can stroke and feed. There’s also a really cool chimpanzee sanctuary there.

*   Amboseli National Park. Located in the shadow of the breathtaking Mount Kilimanjaro, close to the Tanzanian border, this has got to be the best place to see elephants in Kenya. The scenery is eerily remote, scarred by frequent tornadoes, and occasionally marshy. Great birdlife too.

*   Lake Naivasha, the smaller neighbour of Lake Nakuru. It shares many similarities with the latter, but it’s a much better place to see hippos. You can even take a boat tour onto the water! The terrestrial wildlife around the lake isn’t as rich as Nakuru’s, however.

*   Tsavo West, a huge national park southeast of Amboseli. Similar to Samburu, it’s very dry, but has unique reddish dust (which stains its iconic “red elephants”). There are a lot of cool spots, such as the volcanic rocks at the Shetani Lava Flow and a flourishing water-hole right next to a hotel.

Those are all the Kenyan wildlife areas I’ve been to, and each of them was beautiful in its own way. There are so many others - Kakamega, Mount Kenya, Tsavo East, Buffalo Springs, Meru, Shaba, Aberdare, Sibiloi, Hell’s Gate, Chyulu Hills, Marsabit - which I hope I can visit one day, and I’m sure they’re spectacular too.
