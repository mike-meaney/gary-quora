I think that the yapok, Chironectes minimus, is very interesting, yet fairly little known. Also known as the water opossum, it’s found over much of South and Central America, and it’s pretty cute too. They mainly eat fish, but sometimes actually manage to catch sleeping bats.

It is a fascinating creature in numerous ways. First of all, it’s the only truly semi-aquatic marsupial in the world. Its close relative, the lutrine opossum, does venture into the water every now and then, but not enough to be called semi-aquatic.

Yapoks have evolved several adaptations to improve their aquatic abilities. Their back feet are webbed, though their front ones aren’t - perhaps to maintain dexterity. What’s very cool, though, is that they can seal their pouches shut so they can swim without their young drowning.

Yapoks are also the only extant marsupials in which males have pouches as well as females. These are nearly as airtight as the females’, and are used to protect the reproductive organs in cold water.

Yet another interesting thing about these opossums is that it appears that they have independently evolved a sixth digit, likely derived from a wrist bone. Better yet, this extra digit is opposable just like the human thumb. Perhaps, in the far future, intelligent yapoks will dominate the world and build civilizations as we did…
