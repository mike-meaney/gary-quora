There are, as it happens. The order Rheiformes contains two species of ratite which the average layperson probably couldn’t distinguish from an emu or ostrich. They are the American rhea and Darwin’s rhea.

The former, also known as the greater rhea, is found in eastern South America, whereas the latter, a.k.a. the lesser rhea, inhabits Patagonia and the Andean Plateau. Ironically, Darwin’s rhea was first described by Alcide d’Orbigny, a French naturalist who was a major rival of Charles Darwin.

Some authorities, including the IUCN, recognize a third species - the puna rhea - but it is generally thought to be a subspecies of the lesser rhea. Rheas, ostriches and emus are all ratites, and - while they look very similar - they all evolved the appearance independently.

This fascinating revelation came to light when it was discovered that certain ratites which lived in the same place (e.g. moas and kiwis, both of New Zealand) were less closely related to each other than other ratites, meaning they must have flown to the region separately, meaning their common ancestor wasn’t flightless.

The nail in the coffin was the discovery that tinamous - another group of ratites which live in the New World - are nested deeply within the group, evolutionarily, rather than being basal to it. Tinamous aren’t flightless, so this disproves the idea that ratite flightlessness evolved just once.

Historically, both Madagascar and New Zealand also had their own large, ostrich-like ratites. These were the elephant birds (the largest birds known thus far) and moas (the second-largest birds known) respectively.
