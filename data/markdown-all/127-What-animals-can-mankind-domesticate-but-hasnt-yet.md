There are many examples, but one I’d like to put forward is the spotted hyena.

In 1790, the traveller James Bruce noted that, in the Cape of South Africa, spotted hyenas are kept as pets by the local peasants. He writes:

> He is preferred to the dog himself for his attachment to his master, his general sagacity, and even, it is said, for his qualifications in the chase.

Then, in 1801, Sir John Barrow in his An Account of Travels into the Interior of Southern Africa that people in the Snow Mountains of South Africa had kept hyenas and trained them to hunt large game. He writes that they were:

> As faithful and diligent as any of the common dogs

Then, of course, in the walled city of Harar, Ethiopia, you have the semi-urbanized clan of spotted hyenas, which at night report to a regular site to be fed scraps by the locals.

The animals are so tame that tourists are allowed to feed them - from their mouths. Yes, you can hold a meat-baited stick in your mouth and have wild carnivores come up and eat it. It’s also worth noting that being fed scraps by humans is thought to be the way that wolves came to be domesticated.
