## Do Hyaenas ever pursue lion cubs or herbivorous calves? Do they hunt similarly to wild dogs?

Lion cubs have not, as far as I know, ever been documented to be killed by hyenas. Adult lions, however, have most certainly died at their hand, but they are not always eaten.

Spotted hyenas will often tackle wildebeest calves and zebra foals, though it seems they prefer larger animals. Thomsonâ€™s gazelle fawns are simply too small, and buffalo calves are typically too well-guarded to attack.
