No, as far as we know… but we can attempt at making one here. For at least a rough estimate, it isn’t as hard as it sounds. So, this is Pangaea:

Figuring out the climate is simply a matter of determining temperature and precipitation. First of all, we need wind. Although the lay of the land does have an effect on prevailing winds, it would take much longer for me to go into that much detail.

Instead, I’ll just go with a simplified version of Earth’s prevailing winds, like this:

Using that, we can guess at the surface currents of the oceans. Warm currents are marked red and cold currents blue.

Thirdly, we need to know where the high mountains are. Based on a map by Britannica, it should look something like this:

You can already see certain modern ranges like the Appalachians, the Caucasus and the beginnings of the Andes. The last thing we need to start figuring out the biomes is temperature - as in, average global temperature.

According to Wikipedia, during the Triassic Period the average global temperature was 17 degrees Celsius, compared to 14 today. It’s hard to predict the implications of this on climate, but as an estimate I’ll just expand the tropical climates, and shrink the polar ones, a touch.

So, I’ve come up with something like this:

The sandy-coloured areas would be extremely arid deserts. They are found very far inland, and on the leeward side of mountain ranges, even on the coasts (in places with cold currents).

The light green areas would be milder, with a similar climate to today’s savannahs or semi-arid regions.

In the wettest areas of the tropics, such as along warm coastal currents or on the windward side of mountain ranges, you might find tropical rainforests.

The black areas, as said, are high mountains.

Moving into the cooler latitudes, we have a lot of dark blue. This, I think, would be where you’d find temperate, continental climates, similar to Eastern Europe or the mid-Atlantic states.

In the lighter blue areas, the change of seasons would be less drastic due to the stabilizing influence of the sea. Climate-wise, think Western Europe.

Marked orange are the temperate, coastal regions which are more arid - the Mediterranean areas.

In pink, we have subtropical areas which, while seasonal, are hot and humid. The largest of these in the present day are located in the Southern US and South China.

Lastly, there are the colder climes - the boreal forests, marked purple,

And, in the far north, the tundras, which I doubt would look much different to today’s.

In any case, that’s my guess at the biomes and climate zones of Pangaea, at least in the Triassic Period. This is just a rough estimate, so it’s unlikely to be very accurate, but it’s the best I’ve got.
