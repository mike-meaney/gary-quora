It faced a lot of competition

The Miocene seas which Carcharocles megalodon inhabited were probably incredibly competitive; they were chock-full with all kinds of large predators.

Perhaps an adult Megalodon’s biggest rival would be Livyatan melvillei - a 50-ton sperm whale with teeth twice the size of bananas, the largest feeding teeth (i.e. excluding tusks) of any animal in history. Livyatan, in my opinion, was probably the most formidable predatory tetrapod ever to live.

In addition to this monster, Megalodon had to contend with several other species of raptorial sperm whale, 2 giant species also in Carcharocles, 3 more species of giant shark, a dolphin the size of a killer whale, and various “shark-toothed dolphins” or Squalodontids.

Its true identity has long been debated

Originally, Carcharocles megalodon was thought to be closely related to the great white sharks, due to the similarity of their teeth. However, it’s now thought that the similarity is down to convergent evolution - both Megalodon and the great white hunt large prey, and evolved teeth for the same purpose.

Now, scientists think that Megalodon is a member of the extinct shark family Otodontidae, closer to mako sharks than to great whites. For a long time, the controversy was settled - however, recent studies have claimed that C. megalodon should not be C. megalodon at all, but O. megalodon.

Otodus is an earlier genus of shark, thought to have evolved into Carcharocles. These studies argue that that Megalodon - and its relatives - are too similar to Otodus to be in their own genus, and should be species of Otodus instead.

Why did it go extinct?

There are numerous ideas on the extinction of Megalodon. The first of these is climate change - according to this idea, cooling temperatures stalled the Gulf Stream, depriving the shark’s native seas of nutrients to support a rich ecosystem.

A different hypothesis suggests that it was due to the extinction of several whale species which Carcharocles megalodon depended on for prey. Some say that whales simply evolved to be too big even for Megalodon’s jaws.

Other ideas still maintain that it was the emergence of smaller, faster predators that drove Megalodon to extinction. Perhaps the culprits were early killer whales and other cetaceans (which can hunt large whales, but in agile pods), or even the modern great white.
