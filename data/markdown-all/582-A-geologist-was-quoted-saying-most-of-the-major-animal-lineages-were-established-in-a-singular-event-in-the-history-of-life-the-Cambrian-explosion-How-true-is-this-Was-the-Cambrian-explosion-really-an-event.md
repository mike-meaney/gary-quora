## A geologist was quoted saying most of the major animal lineages were established in a singular event in the history of life

This is another example of the conceit of hindsight, arch-nemesis of understanding evolution.

By looking at extant animals, we observe that some of them share the same bodyplan, while others don’t, and so we group each rough bodyplan into a large taxon called a phylum. Then, to stay phylogenetically correct, any extinct organism evidently related to the modern phyla is grouped with or within that phylum.

For example, here is a Precambrian (purported) arthropod ancestor, Spriggina.

Were I some kind of Ediacaran biologist, I would classify Arthropoda not as a phylum, but say, a class of the phylum Ecdysozoa (which is in reality considered a superphylum containing Arthropoda). It doesn’t look awfully different from other standard worms of the time, yet because of our classification system we must categorize it as more arthropod than worm.

Another example of how confusing this “present-centric” system is is that if there is a mother animal which is the common ancestor of two groups (let’s say chimps and humans), then one of its children is on the human line of apes while the other is on the chimp line, despite the two looking almost identical.

So, perhaps by a spike in oxygen levels, the rate of evolutionary change rose and things began to look more different. It is a whole law of evolution that the further back in time you go, the more similar organisms look, so what are we to expect?

I could have talked about other things, such as the slowness (dozens of millions of years) of the Cambrian “explosion” and the illusion of heightened diversity due to innovations in fossilizable shells and exoskeletons, but this is just a more little-discussed point I wanted to highlight.
