There are. There are more species of carnivorous bipeds than there are species of mammals, in fact.

First of all, there’s the top predatory birds, the raptors. These are some of the only birds that hunt big animals.

You have the 200 species in the order Strigiformes:

About seven in the order Cathartiformes:

More than 200 in the order Accipitriformes:

And 60 in the order Falconiformes:

And those are just the big animal predators. If you include any bird that eats animal matter of some kind, then that would include virtually every species of passerine (Order Passeriformes) in the world, which is about 6,000.

Then we have mammals. Humans are omnivores, but are still the global apex predator, and are bipeds. Virtually all primates have bipedal capabilities, and there are about 200–350 species of them.

If we want habitual bipeds, the mammals have still got some. The Macropods - with 65 species - are bipedal, and most of them eat insects when they’re available.

There are also kangaroo rats, but they are herbivores, and springhares. Springhares are primarily herbivores but eat insects often as well.

Some carnivorous pangolins can walk a few metres on two legs, too.

So, to summarize: All 500 birds of prey (carnivorous), 6,000 passerines (omnivorous), 65 species of Macropod (omnivorous) and springhares (omnivorous) eat meat and walk on two legs all the time. Pangolins (carnivorous), and primates (omnivorous) can walk on two legs for reasonable amounts of time, but don’t do so naturally.
