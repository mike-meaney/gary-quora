The world is full of a lot of amazing, often otherworldy places - some of them you may know, others you might not have heard of. Here are my favourites.

*   Lençóis Maranhenses National Park: Located in northern Brazil, this is an immense field of coastal sand dunes, which - in the rainy season - fill up with vibrant lagoons. To survive the change of seasons, some fish burrow into the sand and form a protective cocoon to wait out the dry season underground.

*   Caño Cristales: This river in Colombia is famous for the many species of aquatic plants which colour its waters red, pink, yellow, green and blue, giving it the nickname “the Liquid Rainbow”. These riverweeds bloom from the start of August through November, the most notable species being Macarenia clavigera, which is only found in the river.

*   Sơn Đoòng Cave: By volume, this is undoubtedly the world’s largest cave - easily large enough to fly a Boeing 747 in. Located in Vietnam (near the border with Laos), it measures some 200 metres in height and 150 in width. Here, stalactites may be 10 times as tall as a typical two-story house, and you can find [cave pearls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_pearl "en.wikipedia.org") as big as baseballs.

*   Dallol: Located amidst the volcanic turmoil of where the African, Arabian and Somali plates are separating, Dallol is a hydrothermal wasteland in Ethiopia. Simultaneously one of the hottest, saltiest and most acidic places on Earth, it’s hard to find a place more extreme. The geological activity has created bizarre salt formations resembling terraces, domes and pillars.

*   Tsingy de Bemahara stone forest: The aforementioned Son Doong cave is the result of the local karstic geology - in Madagascar, a similar situation has created this “stone forest”. The many needles of rock have been eroded by streams into a labyrinth of limestone, and are home to an exceptional number of endemic species.

*   Wulingyuan: This famous section of the Wuling Mountains in southeastern China is home to some 3,000 pillars of sandstone, which tower 200 metres above the ground. Like the stone forest above, the region has been eroded by water, resulting in one of the planet’s most spectacular landscapes. To get a better viewpoint, visitors can take the world’s tallest outdoor elevator to the world’s longest glass bridge.

*   Tepuis: Found in Venezuela, Brazil and Guyana, these are huge sandstone mesas which form most of the Guiana Highlands. Rising abruptly up to a kilometre over the surrounding jungles and savannahs, there are hundreds of them found in the region. The most famous tepui is perhaps Auyán-tepui, because the 807-metre Angel Falls drops off it. One the table-like tops of these mesas, there are bizarre rock formations and huge sinkholes which house many species found nowhere else.

So, those are a few surreal places I can think of, although there are quite a few more I would name had I the time. I tried to avoid the usual picks, such as Pamukkale, Waitomo, and Salar de Uyuni, so hopefully you learned some new things from this answer. Thanks for reading!
