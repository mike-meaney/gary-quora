## What are some of the more amusing or ironic taxonomic, scientific names assigned to newly discovered species, by researchers? Are there any rules for the naming process?

Thanks for your A2A,

As it happens, there are rules for scientific naming of organisms. These are set in place by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) and the International Botanical Congress.

Some of the rules include;

*   The type subspecies of a species (e.g. Homo sapiens sapiens) must share its subspecific name with its specific name, hence the double sapiens
*   Species (and only species) must have a binomial name or binomen, e.g. Homo sapiens
*   The oldest taxonomic name for a species/clade is the proper one. Thus, if someone, today, named our species Anthropus sapiens, it’s not a valid name because there was already one in place
*   Every taxon must have a unique name

Anyway, that’s the boring bit over and done with. Now onto the funny names.

* * *

Some of the more comical scientific names I know of are;

Aha ha, a species of Australian wasp.
