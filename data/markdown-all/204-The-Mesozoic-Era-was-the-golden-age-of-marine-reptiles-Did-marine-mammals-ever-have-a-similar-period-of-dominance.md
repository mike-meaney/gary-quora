The closest thing, I think, would be the Miocene epoch, which occurred roughly from 23 million years ago to 5 million years ago. To me, this is one of the most interesting time periods of all for many reasons, including the fact that it had a huge diversity of mammal life in the oceans.

As Antarctica and Australia split apart, a new ocean current formed - one which wrapped around the whole world. Known as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, it caused a shift in global climate and a massive upwelling of deep-sea nutrients. At the same time, kelp forests and other algae began to proliferate globally.

The oceans were set for a rapid increase in biodiversity, and the marine mammals were among this radiation.

First of all, there were the baleen whales. These had been around since about 34 mya, but this was the first time they really diversified. In the Miocene, there were over 20 different genera of baleen whales, in comparison to today’s 6. This was also the first time they got big, with several species being over 10 metres in length.

One, Balaenoptera sibbaldina, may have even rivalled the modern blue whale in size, although this is debated.

The toothed whales also became much more abundant during this time. One lineage even became the apex predators of the oceans (alongside sharks) - the so-called macroraptorial sperm whales. There were many species, all of which were adapted to hunt other marine mammals, rather than small prey like fish, squid or plankton.

Their teeth were huge and conical, and coated in enamel, and their jaws could open very wide. The muscles of the cheeks and back were evidently very strong, giving them both great bite force and swimming speed.

The largest of all these hyper-carnivorous sperm whales was Livyatan melvillei, which was perhaps the largest active predator ever to exist. Named after both the Biblical Leviathan and the author of Moby Dick, it may have measured up to 17.5 metres in length. Each of its teeth were over a foot long, the largest (excluding tusks) of any animal ever.

Being such a massive animal, it likely could have preyed on almost anything it encountered, including other whales. Livyatan’s main competitor was likely Otodus megalodon, the infamous shark of comparable size. Giant sharks flourished in the Miocene for the same reasons that marine mammals did, and O. megalodon was the biggest.

Another Miocene sperm whale - a much smaller, lesser-known one - which I find interesting is Rhaphicetus. It had a very long, thin beak and rows of tiny teeth, adapted for quickly snapping up fish. It was basically like a sperm whale trying to be a river dolphin.

Speaking of dolphins, even some of them decided to hop on the “supersized” bandwagon. There were the various species in Squalodon, which were about the size of a modern killer whale, but much toothier. They were originally mistaken for dinosaurs when discovered, and get their name from their shark-like dentition.

Other giant dolphins of the Miocene include Macrokentriodon:

And Hadrodelphis:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f73c88cec8ef1b34149d56d423f12b29-pjlq)

There were many families of toothed whale back then which we don’t even have any more, such as the Inticetids, with their almost crocodilian snouts:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-29084eabbb1fcfc426512b1723cf8c52-lq)

And, perhaps the strangest Miocene cetaceans of all, the odobenocetopsids. The one genus in this group - Odobenocetops - had a bizarre pair of asymmetrical tusks projecting backwards from its broad snout. These may have actually been sensory organs, as they were likely too brittle for fighting.

Odobenocetops had powerful lip muscles, but nothing in the way of teeth (aside from its tusks). This indicates that it was a suction feeder, vacuuming up shellfish on the seabed like a walrus.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c05d69f26aa6d206b9110ffa2a429d46-pjlq)

And all that was just the cetaceans. Over the course of the Miocene, the evolution of the pinnipeds (seals and their relatives) accelerated - at the beginning of the epoch, most were otter-like semi-aquatic creatures, and by the end, they closely resembled the species alive today.

One of these early, primitive pinniped relatives was Kolponomos. It had the build of a bear, and was originally classified as a cousin of raccoons when it was discovered, but it turns out that it was actually a precursor to seals. Its huge neck muscles and robust molar teeth indicate that it was a specialist predator of tough-shelled clams and the like, so it was almost like a giant sea otter.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7192afae3b1a3c2eb83da56af5f7e8f3-lq)

As the Miocene progressed, the pinnipeds became more familiar. A new family, the desmatophocids, evolved, related to today’s walruses and sea lions. The largest species, Allodesmus, was a big boy, measuring around 2.5 metres long.

What’s really interesting about Allodesmus is that, if you look at a cross-section of its teeth, there are abrupt growth rings at regular intervals. This, we can assume, is because the males would stay on the beach during the mating season, to defend their harem of females. During this time they would not venture out to sea to find food, so their teeth didn’t get worn down at all.

It’s amazing how much we can tell about an animal’s behaviour based on so little material.

Eventually, the pinniped groups we know today emerged - the odobenids (walruses), otariids (eared seals) and phocids (true seals). Back in this time the walrus family in particular was incredibly diverse; there were at least eighteen species, in contrast to the one living walrus today.

The largest of all these was the formidable Pontolis magnus, pictured on the right below. With an estimated weight of up to 4,000 kg, this beast was as big as an Asian elephant and is easily one of the largest carnivorans ever to exist. If that wasn’t enough, it had four tusks instead of two.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a24b8d3d7889b2475e74b6fdf70fee69-pjlq)

Another genus, Pelagiarctos, was of a similar build but wasn’t quite as large.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1773717b1482c2e84dcd75c4f985372f-lq)

On the opposite end of the spectrum, you had the adorable Nanodobenus, the smallest-ever known member of the walrus family. It was about 1.6 metres long and didn’t even have any tusks. I like to call it the smallrus.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a0bc8c507586bb9e83312b5bbc726de4)

Then came the otariids, represented today by the sea lions and fur seals. They seemingly weren’t as diverse as odobenids during the Miocene, but there were still some very interesting species. My favourite is Thalassoleon, which was huge - the size of a modern walrus. It lived in California.

Confusingly, Thalassoleon translates literally to “sea lion”, even though it was a fur seal. In fact, it’s thought to be the direct ancestor of the northern fur seal, an old species which originated in the subsequent Pliocene and is still alive today.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-777c4bb0b3a92dd72aba4075ca2e55e6-pjlq)

Finally, there were the true seals, in the family Phocidae. These are distinguished from other pinnipeds chiefly by their lack of external ears, among other things. There are two genera which stand out to me. Firstly, there’s the delightful Praepusa.

Praepusa may be the smallest ever marine mammal, measuring around sixty centimetres in length. There were quite a few species - one in what’s now the Netherlands, and a handful more in Central and Eastern Europe. During that time, the latter region was covered by a huge inland sea known as the Paratethys, the last remnants of which are the Black and Caspian Seas.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-617150440a7888510a8be68c06526b5d)

The second is Hadrokirus, which was less cute and a lot less tiny. Found on the Pacific coast of South America, it was related to today’s Antarctic seals, such as the leopard seal. Around 2.5 metres long, its jaws were thickly muscled and bore robust teeth, perfect for crunching tough matter. This may have been shellfish, or perhaps even bone.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-98d3eee4cfb95887852d64425c48cd3b-lq)

That creature the Hadrokirus is feeding on in the illustration above is perhaps the strangest of all the Miocene’s marine mammals; the sloth Thalassocnus. Yes, believe it or not, even sloths cashed in on the new underwater bonanza of productivity. Thalassocnus was perfectly adapted for the semi-aquatic way of life, with dense bones and a long, beaver-like tail to counteract buoyancy, and a strong set of jaws for chomping seagrass.

However, it would have been clumsy on land, as it had weak neck muscles (since it spent most of its time with its head down on the seafloor) and brittle legs. Like hippos, they probably walked along the bottom of shallow water to graze.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6ceddbd0804cbad7dd028266c87b1cc7-lq)

The modern three-toed sloths are quite closely related to Thalassocnus, and they too are surprisingly strong swimmers.

Lastly, I’m going to talk a bit about otters. Just like basically every other animal group in the Miocene, these guys suddenly became huge too. The largest member of the mustelid family ever was the Miocene otter Enhydriodon, which has been estimated at up to a staggering 200 kilograms in weight.

This lion-sized beast was not technically a marine mammal, as it was a freshwater animal, dwelling in the lakes and swamplands of Ethiopia. Its thick, crushing teeth indicate that it fed on a lot of hard food - perhaps turtles, crocodilians, armoured catfish, bivalves and the like. That being said, it may have preyed on land animals too…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-65407c26c06b83a6350977e735dc9b7e-lq)

A close relative of Enhydriodon, Enhydritherium, was also very large, and could be found in what would become Mexico and the southern United States.

Then, over in Asia, you had Siamogale, which lived in the wetlands of China and Thailand. Its weight has been estimated at around 50 kg, comparable to a grey wolf. One species, S. melilutra, was discovered in just 2017.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b394096d222f2d35d951ff68bbd93ff9-pjlq)

So, that about covers the amazing marine mammal fauna of this time.

The brilliant part is that this is just one part of what makes the Miocene so unique: at the same time, you had the emergence of many giant sharks and penguins, the first grasslands, a wave of supersized creatures on land, a huge swampy lake of mega-beasts in the Amazon Basin, and ecosystems in South America which were dominated by reptiles, not mammals.

I hope you’ve enjoyed this (long) answer, thanks very much for reading. Have a great day.
