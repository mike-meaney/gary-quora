Kamunyak, the lioness

Kamunyak - meaning “Blessed One” - is, or perhaps was unfortunately, a female lion native to Samburu National Park in Kenya. At the age of two or three, in late 2001, Kamunyak did something which would make her famous and cause uproar in the ethological community.

She was seen with the calf of an oryx, scarcely a few months old. But this calf was not dead and it was not her prey. The oryx had been, unfortunately, separated from its herd, but it was not yet to meet its end, for the lioness had adopted the calf.

For 16 days, Kamunyak protected it voraciously. She defended it against potential predators and even rival lion prides, and tried her best to care for it. Alas, an oryx is not a lion cub, and a bit over two weeks into her parenthood the calf died, likely from starvation.

Dr. Craig Packer, a lion expert, wrote this on the event after hearing about it from Saba Douglas-Hamilton (the well-known conservationist who first documented the adoption):

> My best guess is that she is just a subadult and subadults can get into some pretty weird routines (some become obsessed with tyres and start chewing on every LandRover they see; others get obsessed with canvas tents and like to twang the guy ropes) — but they eventually outgrow it. I’d bet that she gives this up by the time she’s 3.5 – 4 yrs old.

However, Kamunyak proved everyone wrong. That first oryx was not the last we would see of her bizarre behaviours, by no means. The Blessed One, over the course of her life, adopted 5 more oryx calves. Sadly, a similar fate befell them all, although that is to be expected.

The lion lies down with the lamb

The calves were taking their toll on Kamunyak, too. A lion cub can be told to stay, so as not to blow one’s cover on the hunt, but oryx know nothing of how stealth works. Many of the lioness’ hunts have apparently been ruined by her “children”, and you can see it - look how gaunt she is in the first picture.

Kamunyak was last sighted in 2004, and despite several well-funded attempts to find her, she hasn’t been seen since. It’s likely that the starvation has kicked in and the Blessed One has met her end.
