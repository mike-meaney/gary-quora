Well, something on that scale would be an apocalyptic scenario, but it is possible that a remnant of the human race could get by with just five species. Of course, the primary reason we need other organisms is for food. So, how can we minimize the number of food species and still have a healthy population?

For one thing, we need potatoes. It’s a commonly cited fact that humans can survive in the long-term on a diet of only potatoes and milk, much like the Irish did during the Great Famine. That’s mostly true - the main ramification of such a diet would be the absence of the micronutrient molybdenum.

Potatoes are also self-pollinating, meaning they don’t require insects such as bees to reproduce. Instead, they have both male and female flowers on each plant, and pass pollen from one to the other.

So, now we need “milk”, and something to cover our molybdenum needs. As it happens, we can kill two birds with one stone here. First things first, mammalian milk is out of the question - vertebrates need ecological support from far too many species. Instead, we can use a milk substitute - the ideal option being peanuts.

As a legume, the peanut has three vital characteristics - it’s self-pollinating, it can be used as a substitute for milk, and it’s also a rich source of molybdenum. Not only does it complement the potatoes in our minimalistic diet, but it tackles the issue of molybdenum deficiency.

The main concern I have with this potato-peanut milk diet is the lack of Vitamin D. Indeed, most plant-based milk substitutes are fortified with the vitamin artificially. So, as a rich Vitamin D source, I think we need some kind of edible mushrooms.

Of course, being fungi and not plants, mushrooms don’t need to be pollinated. But what’ll they eat? As decomposers, they could break down the dead and decaying potato and peanut plants, balancing out the micro-ecosystem.

We’ve used three of our five species, and things are looking pretty good. And we’ve still got two species left - what shall they be? We need something to aerate the soil in which the plants will live, and I think earthworms are the right animals for the job.

Like the mushrooms, they’re decomposers, and will help prevent dead plant matter from piling up. On a small enough scale (in climate-controlled, airtight spaces, as the mass extinction would have screwed up the atmosphere big time.), I believe that an ecosystem could function with these more.

For our last species, I’m going with one of termites.

Termites are edible and high in protein, and they can be easily farmed even in small spaces. As for food, again they’re decomposers, so they can be fed the dead remains of the other organisms.

So, if you were to build a bunker of sorts, with life support systems to maintain proper levels of oxygen inside, and farm potatoes and peanut plants - with the aid of artificial climate control, mushrooms, worms and termites - you probably could survive, indefinitely, in this post-apocalyptic scenario.

Edit: In this answer, I had to ignore bacterial species; with just five including them, human survival is a no-no. We need bacteria in our body to protect us from diseases and digest our food, many leguminous plants need them to fix nitrogen, and termites need them to break down cellulose.

Then again, some have argued the definition of a species can’t apply to bacteria, since they reproduce asexually. From that point of view, I guess the original answer more or less checks out.
