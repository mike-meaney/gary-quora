Around 23 million years ago, the Andes had become high enough that they caused a huge increase in rainfall in Amazonia, because they blocked clouds from blowing further west. This, in turn, meant that the land was being eroded at a very high rate, and an enormous system of lakes and wetlands was created.

This is known as Lake Pebas, although it was more likely many lakes, or perhaps just a huge network of swamps. In any case, what is most fascinating about the Pebas ecosystem is the animals which inhabited it. They include:

*   Stupendemys, one of the largest turtles in history. Its shell was over 3 metres long, and its carapace alone weighed as much as a small car. Additionally, males had a set of horns protruding from either side of their necks, which would have been used in combat.

*   Purussaurus, quite possibly the largest crocodilian ever to live. A type of caiman, it was probably between 10 and 13 metres in length, and could have weighed over 8,000 kilograms. Additionally, it had an estimated bite force of 69,000 newtons, as much as twice that of Tyrannosaurus rex.

*   Gryposuchus, a very large gharial which was roughly 10 metres long. It was a member of an extinct group known as the gryposuchines, which were generally seagoing species - however, Gryposuchus itself seems to have been more of an inland freshwater-dweller. Its name translates to “griffin crocodile”.

*   Mourasuchus, yet another giant crocodilian. It’s nicknamed the “pancake croc” for its bizarre snout, which was broad and flat - almost like a duck’s bill. It’s thought that it also had a large, grooved pouch in its throat, like pelicans do. These were both adaptations for filter feeding - to me, the idea of a caiman filtering water like a whale is pretty amazing.

*   Phoberomys, a genus containing several species. These were among the largest rodents ever to live - some may reached weights of up to 700 kilograms. In terms of ecology, they were probably similar to modern day hippos - herbivores, spending most of the day in the water, perhaps grazing at night.

As you can see, in its time Lake Pebas would have been a true land of giants. Of course, this is not to mention all the land animals from the area - terror birds and giant ground sloths among them - or those from other regions of South America, such as the Argentinian Megapiranha (it’s exactly what it sounds like).
