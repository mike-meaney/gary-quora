I’ve written about quite a few such rituals before - from [hyena feeding](https://www.quora.com/Can-hyenas-be-domesticated/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") to [wearing gloves made of stinging ants.](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-rituals-of-boys-initiation-into-manhood/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") This time, though, there’s another old tradition I think deserves a mention.

In northern India, there exists an obscure community of Muslim people known as the Mirshikar. The vast majority of their numbers (which are estimated at least 10,000) are found in Bihar, a densely populated state in the foothills of the Himalayas. The name Mirshikar roughly translates to “lord of hunters”, I believe, and it is a well-deserved title.

These people are renowned for their practice of hunting and trapping small animals, especially birds. The man in the photo above seems to have caught some Indian ring-necked parakeets and what I think are quails.

Mirshikar culture is so closely entwined with bird-hunting that at least one community has (or rather had, as we shall see) a rite of passage involving the capture of a so-called Loha Sarang. This creature was the bird that we typically call the black-necked stork, a near-5 foot tall beast with a nasty dagger-like bill.

Should he desire to marry a woman, a young Mirshikar man must complete this ritual. He would venture out in search of a stork, armed only with a sharp wooden rod tipped with sticky, caustic lime (a traditional hunting weapon of this group). Once this heavy implement was affixed to its wings, the Loha Sarang is effectively grounded.

If the bird was returned, alive, to the village, the marriage ceremony would go ahead. If the boy failed, he could still try again and again indefinitely until success, and since these people were often polygamous, some would catch multiple storks in order to marry multiple women.

However, this rite of passage has not been practiced in nearly a century. In the 1920s, a would-be bridegroom was gored in the flank by a black-necked stork he was trying to wrangle, and died instantly. After this tragic event, the custom was discontinued for good. This boy was one of the relatively few people known to have been killed by a bird.

So, that about concludes this answer. Thanks for reading, have a great day. The moral of the story: there are safer ways to woo a potential wife than wrestling a vicious waterbird with a razor-sharp twelve-inch beak.
