Striped hyenas:

Striped hyenas are, first and foremost, smaller than spotted hyenas, with a median average mass of 38.5 kilograms, as opposed to the spotted hyena’s 44–64 kilograms.

There are pelage differences too; striped hyenas are, obviously, striped, while spotted hyenas are spotted. (You can tell I’m an expert). Striped hyenas have an erectile mane of long hairs, while in Crocuta it is much more reduced.

The tails of striped hyenas are longer than those of spotted ones, and their ears are larger and pointier. Now, onto behavioral differences. Striped hyenas live on their own or in pairs, whereas hyenas may live in groups of over 90 individuals.

Striped hyenas are quieter and have a smaller repertoire of vocalizations, and are less aggressive and more elusive. Lastly, they scavenge a lot more than they hunt, unlike spotted hyenas.

Brown hyenas:

Brown hyenas are also smaller than spotted hyenas, weighing about 40 kilograms usually.

Brown hyenas have an erectile mane, just like striped ones, whereas spotted hyenas do not. Brown hyenas are unmarked except for their striped legs, and have thick brown fur and a paler face.

They’ve got long tails too, usually about as long as that of a striped hyena, but longer than spotted hyena’s. Again, they’ve got pointy ears rather than the rounded ones of Crocuta crocuta.

Behaviorally, brown hyenas are very similar to striped hyenas; solitary, non-aggressive, elusive, and primarily scavengers.

Aardwolves:

They’re the smallest of all hyaenids, weighing in at about eight kilograms. That’s literally the square root of a spotted hyena’s weight - in other words, they’re small.

Like Hyaena and Parahyaena, aardwolves have a dorsal mane which can be erected when they’re distressed, aggressive, excited, or agitated in general. In terms of markings, they have stripes, much like the striped hyena.

Their ears aren’t as pointy as those of a striped or brown hyena, but they’re still a lot less rounded that those of a spotted hyena. Their tails are long, but proportionately thicker than any other hyaenid’s.

Their strict diet of termites means that they have no reason to be social; insect licking is, I’m afraid, a one-man job. They’re mainly nocturnal, and are just as gentle and reclusive as their striped and brown relatives.
