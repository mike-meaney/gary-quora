## Is Spain the only European country to have deserts? The are some in the AlmerÃ­a, Granada and Murcia areas (with Westerns filmed there such as The Good, The Bad and the Ugly) but do any other European countries have a desert as such?

The Tabernas Desert of Almería, Spain, is commonly referred to as the only desert in mainland Europe, even though there are several other patches of desert nearby, scattered across the southeast of the country.

The Canary Islands are mostly desert too. Some people associate them more with Africa, or simply as part of Macaronesia, but ultimately it doesn’t matter for our purposes as they are also in Spain.

So, are there any other, non-Spanish deserts in Europe? Italy has the so-called Accona Desert, but it is misnamed from a meteorological standpoint. It would be more accurately described as a Mediterranean climate, or a badland.

In Sardinia, there’s also the Piscinas, sometimes called the “Little Sahara”, but this is really just a coastal dune field.

Looking at Greece, we have our first possible contender; the Lemnos Desert, located on a small island in the Aegean. I haven’t seen any climate data which would prove its status as a desert, but I also haven’t seen it called otherwise anywhere.

Turkey has a couple of deserts, such as the Karapınar Desert pictured below, but all of them are in the Asian part of the country, east of the Bosphorus. The European side has a Mediterranean climate.

Time to start looking in more… unexpected places.

Enter the Błędów Desert, located in Poland, believe it or not. It formed when human exploitation lowered the water table, killing off the plants in the area and reducing the soil to loose sands. The Germans trained soldiers for North African deployment here, during World War II.

So, a fascinating place, but not a desert in the scientific sense.

Even more weirdly, there’s the Råbjerg Mile of Denmark. It certainly resembles a blistering desert, but it’s actually just a massive, two square kilometre sand dune, which is slowly migrating across the land as winds blow it northeast.

There are quite a few similar expanses of sand dunes in the Netherlands, the most famous one being known as De Lunse en Drunense Duinen. Try saying that three times fast…

Germany has the Lieberoser Desert, but again, this isn’t an actual desert climate - rather, it’s a barren area of land created by a forest fire in 1942. It has the nickname “Little Siberia”, as it was later used as a Soviet military training ground.

In the interior of Iceland, tectonic activity has created a huge barren region where little plant life grows. Some consider the Icelandic Highlands to be a desert; not an arid desert, but rather a volcanic desert.

Now, time to look further east. In the southern part of Romania, you’ll find what’s known as the Oltenian Sahara; an 800 square kilometre stretch of sands. During Communist rule, the region’s water was pumped out to irrigate farmland elsewhere, creating a hot, arid, treeless wasteland.

The “desert” is growing to this day, consuming about 10 square kilometres of land a year. Dăbuleni, the largest town in the area, has a dedicated sand museum - the only such museum in Europe. Since the Oltenian Sahara is so hot and dry, you could perhaps make a case for this being an actual desert, but I’d say it’s more semi-arid.

The Oleshky Sands of Ukraine are a similar story; they certainly are semi-arid, but not quite dry enough to be considered a true desert. Created by overgrazing from sheep, it was later used as a bombing ground by the Soviets. The area spans 160 square kilometres and even experiences mild sandstorms.

And now, we come to the list’s first undeniable European desert, through and through (outside Spain); the Ryn Desert of western Kazakhstan and southern Russia. It lies to the northwest of the Caspian Sea, just within the boundaries of Europe.

This area is firmly categorized as a cold desert under the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system. So, to answer your question; yes, there is at least one desert in Europe outside Spain.

I suppose I could have put this at the start and finished the answer there, but then we wouldn’t have learned as many fun facts along the way. Thanks for reading everyone, and have a good day.
