Other answerers have some great examples, but I’d like to nominate one more - Undeniable, by none other than Dr. Bill Nye. Chapters 6–21 offer a good explanation of all areas of modern evolutionary theory - from the tree of life to homologies to genetic bottlenecks to punctuated equilibrium.

I would strongly recommend you purchase it, as it also contains some fascinating stuff on the evolution-creation “debate”, GMO foods, and the possibilities of alien life.
