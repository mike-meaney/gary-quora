Here are a few of my favourites, which many haven’t heard of, yet are still fascinating.

Concavenator, a large theropod with a triangular crest above its hips:

Amargasaurus, a sauropod which had two rows of spines running along its neck. Some speculate that they may have been connected by a membrane of skin:

Shunosaurus, another sauropod, with a spiked club on the end of its tail:

Linhenykus, an alvarezsaurid with two one-fingered stubs for arms:

Yutyrannus, a less obscure tyrannosaur said to be that was covered in feathers:

Deinocheirus. This one’s better known among the paleontologically informed, but still underrated:

Nanshiungosaurus, a therizinosaur which some speculate may have lived a moose-like, wetland-living existence:

Siamosaurus, a spinosaurid that inhabited Thailand:

Lastly, I’d like to mention not only one species, but an entire ecosystem of them. During the Late Cretaceous, Europe was a cluster of islands. The limited resources on islands causes species to evolve into “dwarf” forms, so the biggest animal in these European islands was in fact a pterosaur.

Thanks for asking, hope I answered well.
