Neurological advancement is a very difficult concept to define or measure, and perhaps not even one that really exists. However, what I think you’re getting at is what’s usually vaguely referred to as “intelligence”; in other words, behavioural complexity.

So, which arthropod has the most complex behaviour? The excellent [Ken Saladin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ken-Saladin "www.quora.com") makes a well-argued case for the wasps in the genus Ammophila in his answer. Here, I will write about an additional candidate for the title: Portia jumping spiders.

Most Portia species live primarily by hunting and eating other spiders, sometimes double their own size. In order to take down their fearsome prey, they employ a wide variety of incredibly complex strategies, indicating that they have some degree of “intelligence”. They even have special tactics for each type of spider they pursue.

If Portia is stalking a web-building spider, it will be extra careful to avoid being spotted, as these targets are extremely sensitive to subtle vibrations they detect on their web. The Portia might take extensive detours up to an hour long in order to find the optimal angle of attack. Amazingly, it will even wait for gentle gusts of wind to tread on the web, masking its movements to the prey.

Another crafty ploy that these jumping spiders use on web-building spiders is mimicry. They sometimes make deliberate vibrations on the web’s silky threads, imitating the struggles of an entangled fly or the beckoning of a potential mate. The victim is lured to its death by these deceptive signals.

One of the most dangerous types of spider that Portia is known to hunt are the spitting spiders, pictured below. The name is an apt one: to dispatch threats, their mouthparts expel twin jets of toxic fluid in a peculiar zig-zagging pattern. This fluid is a combination of silk and venom, which together produce a sticky net to trap unsuspecting prey.

When on the hunt for spitting spiders, Portia will always approach from behind, out of reach of the deadly spray. That said, if it’s a mother carrying eggs they seek, they attack head on, because the enemy’s spitting mouthparts are occupied, holding the egg sac.

Occasionally, they go after other jumping spiders. These opponents present their own set of challenges: namely, acute vision. Rather than hunt them down in the open, Portia lie dead still and mimic forest detritus. Only when the jumping spider prey has walked close by do they strike.

One might argue that all these hunting strategies are just pre-programmed instincts that have been wired into them from birth, and not really indicative of intelligence. However, research has shown that Portia spiders have the cognitive capabilities to, when confronted with totally unfamiliar hazards, invent and remember effective new tactics through trial and error.

Portia seemingly even have basic social abilities. One species, P. africana, has been observed in East Africa living in groups and sharing food amongst one another. They are also able to distinguish between the silk threads spun by different individual peers, a trait which might imply some basic form of sociality.

While they may not be on the level of birds or mammals, it can’t be denied that Portia jumping spiders are incredibly intelligent. There are very few invertebrates which come anywhere near them in terms of behavioural complexity and inventiveness. That, I think, is as good a method as any for determining which arthropod is the most “neurologically advanced”.
