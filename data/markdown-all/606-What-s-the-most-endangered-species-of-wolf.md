As other answerers have told you, it is the red wolf, Canis latrans.

Not only is it the most endangered species of wolf, it is the 4th most endangered carnivore species in the world. Whatâ€™s really depressing about this is that the species only appeared about 10,000 years ago, making them one of the youngest species on Earth.
