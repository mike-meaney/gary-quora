No.

I assume you’re referring to the infamous “dinosauroid” from the 1982:

The idea that humanoid form is the only body compatible with high intelligence has long been cast away. Elephants, octopuses, crows and dolphins look nothing like humans, and yet are incredibly intelligent, not leaps and bounds behind us in fact.

To form a civilization, the only thing you need besides a good brain is tool-making manipulators. The standard theropod hands would suffice fine, and opposable thumbs would help.

Otherwise, any anatomy is fine.
