The Great Whiskey Fire of Dublin

It’s the afternoon of June 18th, 1875. Up until this point, it was a fairly normal day in the Liberties, a working-class area of central Dublin. That is, until a river of flaming whiskey and malt, six-inches deep and over 400 meters long flowed through the streets.

Between 4:45 and 8 PM that day, two buildings - a malt house and a bonded warehouse - caught fire. The problem was, between them, they contained 5,000 barrels (about 820,000 litres) of whiskey, malt and other spirits. The barrels burst and a raging liquor inferno poured across the area.

Despite this, many saw how to make the best of the situation. An issue of the Irish Times from 3 days later reports:

> It is stated that caps, porringers, and other vessels were in great requisition to scoop up the liquor as it flowed from the burning premises, and disgusting as it may seem, some fellows were observed to take off their boots and use them as drinking cups.

Unfortunately, the great fire, which engulfed the Liberties, hospitalized 24 people, of which 13 died. However, none of the two dozen burned, drowned or inhaled smoke

No, the only casualties of the fire died from alcohol poisoning. They drank too much of the flood’s whiskey and succumbed to the booze. Welcome to Ireland, I guess.
