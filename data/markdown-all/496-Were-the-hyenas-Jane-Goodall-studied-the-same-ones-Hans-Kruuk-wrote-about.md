Probably, yes. The family of spotted hyenas which Jane Goodall studied in the 1980s lived in Tanzania’s Ngorongoro Crater, like these hyenas.

In his seminal 1972 work The Spotted Hyena: A Study of Predation and Social Behaviour, Hans Kruuk compiled observations of spotted hyenas in two different locations - the Serengeti plain, and Ngorongoro, mainly focusing on the former.

As far as I know, Kruuk studied all the hyenas in the Crater, as he managed to figure out the territorial ranges of all eight clans in it:

Given that his work in the Ngorongoro Crater was only a couple decades or so before Goodall’s, I think it’s very likely that she studied some of the individuals Hans Kruuk had previously observed.

Thanks for the A2A!
