Our understanding always changes, but this, I believe, is the most up-to-date description I can give.

The “average” Tyrannosaurus rex was, according to estimations, between 11 and 12 metres long, about 3.5 metres tall at the hip, and approximately 6 tons in weight. The full range for adults, based on our current specimens, 10.5–12.3 metres in length and 5.5–9 tons in weight.

Scales vs. feathers

Unfortunately, it seems likely (at least currently) that T. rex was either featherless, or only had feathers on its back. Sorry, supermegafluffy Rex. This is based on the fact that we have multiple skin impressions showing scales, as well as several clues in the bones indicating the absence of feathers.

Appearance

The colour of T. rex cannot be predicted - mammalian apex predators usually have browns, yellows and greys as background hue, but that’s probably due to their poor colour vision compared to birds. However, we do know that it probably had keratinous “lumps” over its eyes and cheek, large ornamental scales on its muzzle, and fleshy, immobile tissue over the teeth, kind of like lips.

Behaviour

Tyrannosaurus probably commonly fought with other members of its species and was apparently a cannibal, too. Due to the large brood size of the animal, parenting was probably limited. The average T. Rex lived 25 years and reached adult size at 20, perhaps reaching sexual maturity in the late teens, but little is known in that area. Whether they were social is a topic of much debate.

Feeding:

Tyrannosaurus was likely either a “hit-and-run” predator, making a destructive bite and letting shock, blood loss or exhaustion do the rest, or a cursorial pursuit predator. In any case, it targeted large prey, especially ceratopsians. They evidently ripped the heads off killed Triceratops to access the neck flesh which was covered by the frill.
