No, not at all.

Bottlenose dolphins have been many times documented to rescue humans from circling sharks. Humpback whales are probably the most altruistic animals in the world, driving off killer whales to protect seals and even letting sea lions seek refuge on their backs while being hunted.

Chimpanzees, especially young ones, seem to have a burning desire to care for other animals as if they were children, much like young human girls with dolls. For the most part, these are inanimate objects like rocks, but occasionally, live animals will be adopted and taken care of, such as this chimpanzee with a baby genet.

There are dozens more examples, many of which you can easily locate on the Internet. There are orangutans rescuing birds, dogs saving deer, and as Donna said in her answer, elephants have been seen to tug a young rhinoceros out of a mudhole which it was stuck in.

These are all products of altruism, something once an evolutionary mystery, which is behaviour by an animal benefiting another at its own expense. Humans are far from the only species which exhibit altruism on an interspecific level, itâ€™s a widely known phenomenon in mammals.
