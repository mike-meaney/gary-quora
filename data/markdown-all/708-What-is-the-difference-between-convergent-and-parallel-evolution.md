Okay, so let’s label things here, just to make it easier to understand.

So, in either of the evolutionary terms, there will only be three labels, if not less. Each label - which we’ll say will be A, B and C - denotes a specific body plan or trait, not a monophyletic clade (So A would apply to both fish and icthyosaurs).

In convergent evolution, in this case the evolution of a streamlined body for aquatic animals, there is always an A, a B, and a C. Here, A is an ancestral fish, B is an Artiodactyl like Indohyus, and C is a streamlined body that has pectoral fins and a propelling organ at the end of the tail. Even though an early fish is nothing like an ungulate, the end result is still very similar.

In parallel evolution, on the other hand, there is only an A and a B. In the case of the evolution of equids and Thoatherium, A represents a prehistoric ungulate, but B refers to a long-legged, single-toed grazer with a long head. Horses and Prototherids do not form a clade, but they are somewhat related - and while that ancestor looked different to them, it was the same for both organisms.

My apologies if that was confusing, but the bottom line is; with convergent evolution, the ancestors of the resultant organisms are very different (E.g. protochordates and ancestral whales). With parallel evolution, the ancestor - while different from the result - is the same for both organisms, which themselves will thus share many vital characteristics.
