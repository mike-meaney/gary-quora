## If all life on Earth was wiped out and the Earth remained habitable, would life evolve on the same path as before or would it be totally different with another species becoming intelligent?

Definitely not.

If you restarted time to 4 billion years ago, it would. But the thing with the scenario you propose is that the passage of time continues to move on.

Therefore, all the crucial events and extinctions that shaped the life of our planet would not happen.

There would be no Cretaceous extinction, so the dinosaurs wouldn’t have gone extinct. Except that the dinosaurs wouldn’t have been so diverse at the time, because there was no Triassic extinction to kill the land crocodiles.

Then again, not even the land crocodiles would’ve evolved because there was no Permian extinction to begin the Age of Reptiles and seize the world from the amphibians.

But who knows how the amphibians would have been doing by then for that matter, since there was no Devonian extinction to beat them back?

Maybe a whole different kind of fish that would have gone extinct in the Ordovician extinction would have colonized the land, producing an entirely different tetrapod body plan.

The point is, the events that would never happen in the future but happened in the past have shaped the life of our planet tremendously different from how it would have been without them.
