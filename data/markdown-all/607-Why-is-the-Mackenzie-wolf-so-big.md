They live in quite a cold environment, and the larger you are, the lower your surface area-volume ratio. Heat requires surface area to be shed, so the amount of heat your body is producing is disproportionately larger than the amount of heat you can radiate - basically, it keeps them warm.

Arctic wolves probably arenâ€™t as big because food is more hard to come by in their habitat. More size means more cells, more cells means more required ATP, and to get more ATP you need to get more food.

Lastly, size is also helpful for predators, as it can help you overpower larger prey - and get more food. No matter how specialized its dentition, a least weasel is not going to kill a moose. Acquiring larger prey is especially important for pack hunters, because the mass of the kill has to be divided by the number of animals eating.
