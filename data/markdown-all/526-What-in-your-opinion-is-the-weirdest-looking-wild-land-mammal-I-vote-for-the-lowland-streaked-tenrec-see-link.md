The tenrec is a good choice, for sure, although I’m not sure it makes my cut. Here are a few strong contenders for the title, in my view.

*   The platypus, of course.

*   The aye aye.

*   The star-nosed mole.

*   The Antillean ghost-faced bat.

*   The naked mole rat.

*   Pangolins, the scaly, COVID-carrying little critters.

*   Elephants, which are so familiar to us that they seem normal, but in truth are incredibly strange and unique.

*   And, perhaps more so than any other animal on this list - humans.

So, no really obscure or little known species in this answer, except for the bat I suppose, but it’s no coincidence that most of the truly bizarre mammals have gotten their deserved attention already.
