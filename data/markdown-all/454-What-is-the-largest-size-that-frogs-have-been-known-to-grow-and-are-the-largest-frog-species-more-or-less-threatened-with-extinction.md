> What is the largest size frogs have been known to grow

The largest ever frog was probably Beelzebufo ampinga, a creature which lived in Madagascar about 70 million years ago, during the time of dinosaurs. According to estimates, it was about 41 centimetres long and could have weighed nearly 5 kilograms.

Also known as the devil frog, I think it's entirely plausible that this giant fed on the eggs or even young of the dinosaurs they coexisted with, such as Majungasaurus and Masiakasaurus. Technically, the largest specimens we have measure 23 cm, but they are juveniles, and scaling up gives you the 0.4 metre figure.

Today? Most certainly, I'm afraid. The largest extant frog is the goliath frog, which weighs over 3 kilograms and is found only in Cameroon and Equatorial Guinea.

Sadly, the goliath frog is endangered as many local peoples hunt them for food. However, we're trying our best to save them - the IUCN is working with the communities towards sustainable hunting, and Equatorial Guinea has heavily limited the amount exported for the pet trade.
