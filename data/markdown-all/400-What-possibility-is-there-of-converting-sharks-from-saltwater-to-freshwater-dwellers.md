The only true freshwater shark alive today are the river sharks, genus Glyphis, of which there are three species. Of these, the Ganges shark is the only one which is restricted to freshwater only, and is found in India.

There are also the much more famous bull sharks, which can tolerate both saltwater and freshwater conditions. Unfortunately, theyâ€™re the third-most dangerous shark in the world, with 100 recorded unprovoked attacks on humans.

There is also an extinct group of sharks, the xenacanths, which are thought to have been freshwater animals. They were very strange, with eel-like bodies, venomous spines on their backs and weird, bifurcated teeth.

The main reason freshwater sharks are so rare is that fresh water is typically less concentrated than the water in their cells. Due to osmotic pressure and tonicity, this means that water diffuses into the cells, causing them to rupture when they overfill.
