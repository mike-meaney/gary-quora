## Why don't strong animals/predators have large defined pectoral muscles like we do?

These are humans in their “natural state”.

I assure you, these men are in superb physical condition. Chances are they’re fitter than you. However, they’re not excessively muscular, at least superficially - nor is any “natural” animal.

There are no Arnold Schwarzeneggers hunting kudu in the Kalahari or ice fishing in Greenland. Humans who body-build are doing so to make themselves more attractive to potential mates (and yes, that is really why you’re doing it, regardless of your sexual orientation), not to aid their survival.

Humans depend on tools for hunting, and so we have little use for immensely strong muscles (throwing and running are the main things we’re “supposed to” use our muscles for). Most large predators require musculature, and believe me, they are muscular.

However, they’re still more reasonable compared to the most muscular of humans. The only animals which are truly ripped are freaks who have often undergone training for extra muscles, like the famous Roger:

In short, (some of) us humans only have big defined pecs because we have the luxury of professionally set up weight training procedures and a lot of time on our hands.
