The overall definition would be “zoologist” or “animal biologist”, but that’s a very broad term. Zoologists may be:

*   Acarologists - who study mites and ticks
*   Amphibiologists - who study amphibians
*   Anthrozoologists - who study human-animal interactions
*   Apiologists - who study bees
*   Arachnologists - who study arachnids
*   Batrachologists - who study amphibians
*   Biological anthropologists - who study human biology
*   Carcinologists - who study crustaceans
*   Cetologists - who study Cetaceans
*   Cognitive ethologists - who study animal cognition
*   Coleopterologists - who study beetles
*   Cynologists - who study dogs and their biology
*   Echinologists - who study echinoderms
*   Embryologists - who study the development of animal embryos
*   Entomologists - who study insects
*   Ethologists - who study animal behaviour
*   Helminthologists - who study parasitic worms
*   Herpetologists - who study reptiles and amphibians
*   Icthyologists - who study fish
*   Lepidopterologists - who study butterflies
*   Malacologists - who study molluscs
*   Mammalogists - who study mammals
*   Myrmecologists - who study ants
*   Nematologists - who study nematodes
*   Ophiologists - who study snakes
*   Ornithologists - who study birds
*   Parasitologists - who study parasites
*   Paleozoologists- who study extinct animals
*   Planktology - who study plankton
*   Primatologists - who study primates
*   Testudinologists - who study tortoises and turtles
*   Teuthologists - who study cephalopods
*   Saurologists - who study lizards
*   Zoogeographers - who study the geographic distribution of animals
*   Zoopathologists - who study animals’ relationships with diseases
*   Zoophytologists - who study planktonic animals
*   Zootaxonomists - who study the taxonomic classification of animals

That’s all I can think of off the top of my head, but there’s a lot more.

Fields of biology which may include studying animals include:

*   Ecology
*   Marine biology
*   Biomechanics
*   Anatomy
*   Evolutionary biology
*   Cell biology
*   Genetics
*   Human biology
*   Paleontology
*   Physiology
*   Wildlife biology (Yes that’s a separate thing)

And a bunch of other obscure branches. Thanks for reading a long, long, list, and I hope the answer was satisfactory.
