There’s a photo which made the rounds a while ago which I think is a perfect answer to this question:

Above is a harpy eagle next to a man, although one might be forgiven for thinking the eagle was just a smaller person in a feathery suit. In captivity, female harpies can grow to astonishing sizes - the largest known was a staggering 12.3 kilograms!

That’s about as heavy as an average two year-old. Keep in mind that birds are, by design, built to be ultra-light; their bones are pneumatised, or porous, and the skeleton itself takes up a meager amount of the apparent size. Hence, that mammoth harpy eagle would have been much larger than a toddler, volume-wise.

In terms of maximum size, harpy eagles are the world’s largest eagles. However, on average, Philippine eagles are bigger, and ignoring captive harpies, the Steller’s sea eagle (pictured below) has a higher maximum weight than either.

Quite surprisingly, however, is the size of a certain bird which can dwarf any eagle. By maximum mass, it’s the largest flying bird on Earth. It can weigh more than an average 7 year old boy. It’s nearly a metre long and over 2 metres from wingtip to wingtip.

And, if you live in Europe or the Eastern US, it’s probably pretty common where you live.

The mute swan.

I’m sure most people know they’re pretty big, but nevertheless very few are aware that a certain male mute swan was recorded weighing 23 kilograms, which, for a flying bird, is mind-blowing. In fact, discounting now-extinct species, that swan is the heaviest flying bird known to have lived.

Of course, when we look at extinct flying birds…

Things get taken to another level. But that’s an answer for another day.
