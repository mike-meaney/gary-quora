## Are hyenas just giant mongooses?

Phylogenetically, the closest relatives of hyenas are mongooses and kin and Malagasy carnivores. Malagasy carnivores, taxonomically known as euplerids, are a group of predators native to Madagascar, the most well-known member of which is the fossa. Together, these three families form the group Herpestoidea.

However, in terms of their evolutionary history, it’d be better to call them “giant civets”. All Feliform families are thought to have descended from a viverrid (civets, genets, oyans and the binturong)-like ancestor. Compare, for example, the earliest known cat, Proailurus:

With a modern genet:

And the same is true for the hyenas. This is Plioviverrops, an early hyaenid.

Its anatomy is strikingly similar to that of a civet.

In short, it’s more that hyenas are giant civets (adapted for cursorial ground hunting), and mongooses in turn are long-bodied, weasel-like civets.
