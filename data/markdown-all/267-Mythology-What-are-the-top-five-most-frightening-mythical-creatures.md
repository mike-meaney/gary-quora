These will be obscure ones, about which there is little information online, so I’ll do more than five to compensate for the short descriptions.

Zoureg

This serpent from Arabic mythology can reputedly cut through literally anything; it’ll just slither right through walls, trees, rocks and people like a hot knife through butter. The only way to kill it is by chopping of its head as it sleeps.

Penanggalan

A vampire from Malayan mythology, the Penanggalan is a flying woman’s head with bloodied entrails hanging out of its neck. At night, it perches on the houses of laboring women and screeches when they give birth. Using an invisible tongue it laps up the woman’s blood and then returns home to slip into its headless body.

Marool

A giant fish from the mythology of Shetland. It has countless eyes and a crest made of flames (not shown in the illustration). It shrieks in delight as ships sink and lures drowning sailors to their doom with a phosphorescent tongue.

Chang nam

These fist-sized elephants from Thai myths might not seem intimidating at first, but they are truly overpowered. If you see it, you die. If you see its shadow, you die. If it stabs you with its venomous tusks, you die. If it stabs your reflection, you die. Even if it stabs your footprint, you will die. Above is a hoax “taxidermi” of one which gullible tourists can buy in Thailand.

Binaye Ahani

Some Southwestern American cultures believed in these creatures called “Alien Gods”, the offspring of women who mated with inanimate objects. In the case of the Binaye Ahani, the father in question was a cactus. They have no limbs and only the rudiment of eyes, with humanoid faces. From their eyes they shoot lightning which fries any aggressors, and they never move from their spot.

Abuhuku

A humanoid, arboreal creature with the head of a mosquito, this beast is covered in sticky skin which makes its embrace deadly. They cut a hole in the skull of their human prey (always of the opposite sex to them) and suck out the blood. The empty skins of their victims can be seen hanging from trees.

Yara-ma-yha-who

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7bb5a06ba55f57e18f8d18c1db6456d4-lq)

Hailing from Australia, these monsters have huge heads, toothless mouths, jaws which can be unhinged and huge distensible throat pouches. Using suction pads on its fingers, it sucks the blood out of wandering children until they faint. The child is then swallowed whole and later vomited back up. After a second swallowing, you become hairless. After a third, you become covered in hair. After a fourth, you too become a yara-ma-yha-who.

Devouring gourd

Also known as the devouring pumpkin, the devouring gourd was a gourd (pictured above, not of the evil variety) which never stopped growing until it was far, far bigger than a human. It swallowed person upon person, cows, dogs, poultry, even whole villages, until only one pregnant survivor was left. This woman’s son later killed the beast and freed all its victims.
