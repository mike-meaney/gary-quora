Most of today’s large, land-dwelling carnivores can be divided into two categories: the cursorial (running) pack hunters and the solitary ambush predators. It would seem that, for mammals at least, these are the two most efficient survival strategies, because several groups have independently evolved to fall squarely into each category.

All canines which are macropredatory (they eat very big animals, that is) subscribe to the former lifestyle. To be specific, that means the grey wolf:

The dhole:

The African wild dog:

The wonderful yet underappreciated bush dog:

And the dingo (as well as it’s little-known relative, the New Guinea singing dog):

They’re not the only members of the category, however. Despite being more closely related to felines, hyenas very much exemplify this hunting strategy - the spotted hyena in particular.

All of the animals above work together in packs in order to bring down prey much larger than themselves. Because each individual is small (in comparison to the quarry), overpowering prey through brute strength is unfeasible. Instead, they must use superior endurance to run victims into the ground.

This is reflected in their anatomy. The legs are very slim, and the claws are big and blunt in order to provide traction during a long-distance pursuit. The wrists are stiff and immobile, preventing any joint stress that might come with the repetitive impacts of running. The forelegs also tend to be a little longer than the hindlegs.

Long, unbroken pursuits are most viable in open environments, and as such these carnivores typically inhabit savannahs and grasslands. The air carries scents well in these landscapes, so they always have acute senses of smell - hence the elongated, or telocephalic, snout.

Another factor at play is the fact that, once an animal has been chased to the point of total exhaustion, it’s not going anywhere. Thus, pack-hunting carnivores are in no rush to actually kill their prey - they can just start eating and let it die slowly.

To capitalize on this macabre advantage, their carnassial teeth (at the back of the mouth, equivalent to our molars) are usually huge, adapted for crushing through meat, sinew and even bone. In spotted hyenas, the carnassials are almost comically out of proportion!

Now, let’s discuss the second hunting strategy: solitary ambush predation. While the textbook examples of the former category are canines, the most obvious exemplars of this one are felines. Big cats, to be more specific.

That includes the tiger:

The leopard:

And the puma:

Lions are an interesting case, since they live the lifestyle of a pack-hunting predator, but only evolved this behaviour very recently. Anatomically, they still have most of the hallmarks of ambush predators.

Cheetahs are somewhere in between the two - they have many characteristics typical of pack-hunters (males even hunt in cooperative groups called coalitions), but also a few of their feline relatives, and they tend to use agility as their weapon of choice, rather than stamina.

Anyway, there are a handful of other members of the ambush predator classification, such as the polar bear.

As said, all of these animals lead solitary lives. This has resulted in most of them being much larger than animals which hunt in packs - in order to tackle very large targets, they have to carry muscle mass equivalent to that of several small predators.

Rather than running down their prey, they sneak up on it, getting in as close as possible unnoticed before pouncing. Most, but not all, live in forested ecosystems, where the dense vegetation can conceal their approach.

Since they don’t have the luxury of finding their victims in a state of exhaustion, ambush predators must be extremely efficient killers. The legs are thickly muscled, with the back pair being longer than the front pair, in order to produce a powerful lunge. The wrists are very flexible, able to grasp the prey, and the razor-sharp claws are retractible, ensuring that the ground does not dull them.

The dentition is also very different to what you would see in a cursorial pack-hunting predator. Rather than the carnassials, it is the fangs that are absurdly enlarged, as they are used to deliver that lightning-fast fatal bite. Yes, ironically, felines have bigger canines than canines.

This trait is most pronounced in the clouded leopards. Relative to their size, they have the largest canines of any cat, being almost comparable to the saber-tooths of old.

The snout is also brachycephalic (shortened, in other words), a feature which maximizes bite force. This tends to compromise the sense of smell, so the sense of hearing is often much more developed. Good hearing also lends itself well to the forest landscape.

So, that was my incredibly long-winded and digressive way of answering your very simple question. Hopefully some of you found my rambles interesting. If you didn’t want to read all that, here’s a straight answer: canines hunt in packs, so they don’t have to individually match the physical strength of the solitary felines. Thank you for reading, have a great day.
