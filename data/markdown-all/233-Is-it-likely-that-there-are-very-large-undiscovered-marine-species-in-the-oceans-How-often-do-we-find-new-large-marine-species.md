## Is it likely that there are very large undiscovered marine species in the oceans? How often do we find new large marine species?

Well, Type D killer whales were only discovered to be a new species a couple of months ago, and they’re pretty big. People knew about them beforehand, yes, but they weren’t confirmed as unique until very recently.

In 2016, a beached carcass of some kind of beaked whale was reported as a new species. Known to local Japanese as the karasu or kurotsuchi, this new species is as of yet unnamed, but definitely big - 7.3 metres long, and also bigger than its previously known relatives, in fact.

In 2003, a species now known as Omura’s whale was discovered, Balaenoptera omurai. It is still highly mysterious, but - curiously - it’s not all that obscured. In fact it’s apparently found all over the world. At up to 12 metres long, this definitely qualifies as very large. It’s quite beautiful, too, I think.

My point is that it’s not all that unusual for sea creatures much bigger than humans to be suddenly discovered, even in modern times. As you can see, it does happen, although I doubt anything very different from what we currently know about is lurking in the depths.
