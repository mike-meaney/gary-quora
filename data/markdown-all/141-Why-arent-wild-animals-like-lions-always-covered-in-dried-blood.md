In the case of lions at least, because they spend a huge amount of time every day licking themselves clean. A lioness spends around 15–18 hours resting daily (18–20 for a male) and much of that time is spent grooming.

They also groom each other a lot, which serves to strengthen social bonds. When I was in Kenya last year, I captured these two male lions cleaning each other. As a side note, you might notice that they don’t have manes. This is quite common in males in drier climates.

As well as hygiene and bonding, it also ensures that the stench of blood doesn’t alert prey of their presence during hunting. And it’s not just lions; pretty much all mammalian carnivores clean themselves by licking.
