Okay, let’s have a look at this guy.

In this answer, I’ll just be basing my speculation on what I can see in pictures, not on the lore of the films, which I’m not very familiar with. Godzilla is, of course, a reptile - but what kind? There are a few clues one notices right away.

*   Godzilla’s very large thighs are positioned vertically, directly under the waist. This means his hip sockets angle downwards, allowing for an erect leg posture - a feature found only (among reptiles) in some pseudosuchians, which are extinct distant relatives of crocodiles, and dinosaurs.

*   Clearly, his rear limbs are longer than his forelimbs. This “high-hipped” anatomy is typical of the archosauriforms, a reptile group which includes crocodiles, dinosaurs, and many more of their relatives. Even in quadrupedal members of this taxon, the hips are clearly higher than the shoulders.

*   He also appears to be covered almost head-to-toe in thick, scaly armour plating. In zoological terms, he has osteoderms \- deposits of bone embedded in the skin. Many reptiles have osteoderms, but Godzilla’s specifically resemble scutes - bony plates with a layer of keratin on top. Crocodiles bear the archetypal example of these kind of scutes.

Noticing a common factor here? There are likely other ways to interpret Godzilla’s classification, but in my opinion he fits the clade Suchia best. Suchia is a sort of umbrella group that includes crocodilians and all their extinct cousins, dating back to the Early Triassic; 249 million years ago.

Specifically, Godzilla really reminds me of one family of suchians - the aetosaurs. These were herbivores which existed for about 30 million years during the Late Triassic. In many respects, they resembled ankylosaurs - dinosaurs which would evolve 60 million years later.

To me, their similarities to the famous monster are obvious - the small head, tapering neck, barrel-shaped torso, bulky hind legs, huge tail, and so on. They’ve got osteoderms in all the right places, with many species even having spiky projections on their back which recall those of Godzilla.

So, if I had to guess at exactly what Godzilla is, I’d wager he’s a giant, bipedal aetosaur.
