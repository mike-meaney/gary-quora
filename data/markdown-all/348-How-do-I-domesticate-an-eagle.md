No eagle has been domesticated - not yet, anyway - because domestication involves a genetic change in the organism, over multiple generations. However, taming an eagle is certainly possible - indeed, this is an integral part of the lives of many.

In the Eurasian steppe, there are two Turkic ethnicities - the Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz - which practice what’s known as “eagle hunting”. Hunters, known as búrkitshy or bürkütchü, form an intimate bond with a golden eagle, usually female, which is captured as a chick and raised for years.

As well as Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, there are eagle-hunting peoples on the steppe grasslands of Mongolia and Xingjiang. The tradition is traditionally thought to date back to the nomadic Khitan people (below) of the 4th Century, although - fascinatingly - evidence suggests that Neanderthals were catching golden eagles in Spain, 130,000 years ago!

While not the largest, golden eagles are the most powerful of the birds of prey, and the females are especially formidable. The birds are usually used to catch red foxes, corsac foxes and hares, although occasionally young deer or even wolves are hunted.

After the eagle nestling is captured from its nest, which the hunter does himself at only 13, it’s fed daily and wears a hood so it stays calm. When it reaches adulthood, the raptor is presented with the furs and hides of its future quarries, so it knows what to hunt. During a hunt, it’s taken on horseback out onto the steppes, where it may spot prey kilometres away.

Awareness of the eagle-hunting tradition in the West has been helped by the 2016 documentary film The Eagle Huntress. Narrated by Daisy Ridley, it chronicles the story of Aisholpan, a 13-year old Mongolian Kazakh, and her quest to become the first female to compete in the annual Golden Eagle Festival.

The Eagle Huntress grossed over 4.4 million dollars worldwide, receiving a score of 94% on Rotten Tomatoes.

I think that this fascinating tradition - from a pair of equally fascinating cultures - really deserves more recognition in popular culture. How cool would, say, a fantasy novel based on the culture of Kazakh nomads be?
