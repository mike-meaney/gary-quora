My suggestion is Praepusa, a fossil animal I only recently found out about.

(The only reconstruction I could find)

Praepusa is an extinct species of seal which lived during the Miocene epoch, surviving into the earliest part of the Pliocene.

The smallest species, P. pannonica, was only sixty centimetres long, making it smaller than any other known seal, and even (to my knowledge) any other marine mammal.

Interestingly enough, it is one of the few fossil seals in which sexual dimorphism has been observed.
