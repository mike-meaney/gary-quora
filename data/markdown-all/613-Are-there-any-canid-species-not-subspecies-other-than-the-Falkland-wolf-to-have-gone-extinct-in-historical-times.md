## Are there any canid species (not subspecies) other than the Falkland wolf to have gone extinct in historical times?

The last canid species to go extinct before the Falkland wolf was the Zhoukoudian wolf, Canis variabilis.

However, it went extinct 30,000 years ago, so it doesn’t count as a historical extinction.

The next best thing I can give you is subspecies, which include:

*   Hokkaido wolf, Canis lupus hattai (circa. 1973)
*   Japanese wolf, Canis lupus hodophilax (1905)
*   Kenai wolf, Canis lupus alces (1925)
*   Newfoundland wolf, Canis lupus beothucus (1911)
*   Fuegian dog, Lycalopex culpaeus (circa. 1919)

So, I’m afraid to say that the Falkland Islands wolf was the only canid species driven extinct in historical times.

EDIT: I just remembered, the answer is actually probably yes. The Falkland Islands wolf’s closest relative, Dusicyon avus, is thought to have gone extinct around 1000 BCE, which would make it extant (possibly) during the Iron Age. Writing, as far as I can remember, was invented at around 4000 BCE, so it is a historical extinction. Here’s a reconstruction: (Albeit an old one)
