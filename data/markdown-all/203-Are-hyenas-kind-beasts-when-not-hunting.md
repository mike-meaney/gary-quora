Virtually all mammals have very complex personalities, humans most of all. The same can be said of spotted hyenas.

They are affectionate parents.

If they become accustomed to humans, they can come to love them too.

They form deep social bonds and love to play.

At the same time, they are apex predators, and their hunting strategy means that they can’t effectively kill their prey before they start eating. Hyena society can be brutal and unforgiving, especially for new clan members. Humans are sometimes killed by spotted hyenas.

At the end of the day, they’re just like any other intelligent animal. While dolphins do rescue drowning humans and play in bow waves, they also torture other animals and rape females. While some chimpanzees have befriended humans, others have horrifically maimed humans.

Think of all the selfless acts of kindness people have done before. Now think of the genocides. Just like hyenas, or dolphins, or chimps, us humans are complicated creatures.
