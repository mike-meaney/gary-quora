I know this question’s pretty old, but it’s unanswered so I guessed late’s better than never.

I know quite a lot about aberrant colour morphs in big cats, which there are quite a lot of. In big cats alone, there are about 15 more miscolorings, though one or two are reported but unconfirmed.

Zoologists usually organize these colour morphs into 6 major groups, with one out on its own. The first of these is the;

Tawny series

This contains 3 colour morphs and the standard colour: the 3 mutations are as follows:

1\. King - observed in cheetahs, this is where the spots merge and form a network of undulating “stripes”.

2\. Pseudo-melanism - similar to the king phenomenon, this is an even more extreme merging of spots that sometimes renders the big cat (leopards, jaguars and tigers) more black than yellow.

3\. Chocolate - confirmed in cheetahs, there are no photographs of big cats with this phenomenon. However, here’s a chocolate fox instead:

* * *

Now we have the second big group, the;

Red series:

There are 4 mutations here, and they all produce a red- or orange-tinted coat in big cats. These are the red colour morphs:

1\. Erythrism - this causes the coat to be tinted red, and is found in jaguars and leopards. Here’s a leopard who’d be on the less red end of the scale, but is erythristic none the less:

2\. Strawberry - occuring in cheetahs, jaguars and leopards, this is the result of an erythristic cat breeding with one containing the “dilution” gene:

3\. Isabelline - the coat of a cheetah, jaguar or leopard will be cream-coloured. There aren’t many photos of isabelline big cats, but I managed to find one of a cheetah:

4\. Golden - observed in tigers, this makes the stripes orange and the underparts white. It is thought to be the intermediate stage between tawny and white tigers.

* * *

Now, moving on, we have the;

Silver series:

One of the lesser-known groups of miscolorings, these animals all contain the dilution gene, which pales the fur to grey, silver or near-white. There are 4 colour morphs in this group.

1\. Maltese - there are no living examples, but there are historical records (mainly from China) of tigers, leopards and cheetahs with light grey coats and dark grey markings. Here is an artist’s impression:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d3e443d92f6f2d30ac8b4ca7267d05b4-lq)

2\. Blue Chinchilla - another form of Maltese, this is again only reported historically. Assuming these records are correct, it is present in tigers and cheetah and causes a blue-ish coat colour (The picture below is a photoshop)

3\. White (black-marked) - occuring famously in tigers but also in jaguars and some other cats, “white panthers” are big cats that have white fur. There are two forms, the first of which features black markings.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-19ea39ab91250f18b66d2278ee8ec7f5-lq)

4\. White (red-marked) - the second form of white panther is similar superificially and genetically to the first one, but instead of black markings, the bearer possesses red, brown or cream ones.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-32405ded8f37b283159c79b3083a1c98-lq)

So, that’s the silver series done. Now onto the;

Non-agouti series:

Smallest of the major groups, this one contains only two miscolourings. The genes associated with this series induce lack of markings or only faint speckling.

* * *

1\. Speckled - there are no body markings except for a few brown dots. Occurs in cheetah and servals.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b1c17610bcefe1f56520b7fe31561d4-lq)

2\. Ticked - if an animal possesses this gene, it will only have very faint markings. Found in cheetahs and serval, the fur seems blonde at a distance but markings can be seen close-up.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0554a889a1475deaa6ce5b8c36a32b72-lq)

Then we have the second-last group, the;

Black series

You already mentioned melanism, but there are two other miscolorings here.

* * *

1\. Charcoal - no photographic evidence exists, but this dark-grey coloration is seen in jaguars heterozygous for melanism. This is a charcoal corn snake:

2\. Mosaicism - kind of like the reverse of piebaldism, this gives lions black patches. There are no surviving members today, but they have been photographed in zoos.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7c8f2578194c29c52e7aed90dc94067a-lq)

Finally, there’s the last series, the;

White series

You’ve actually already mentioned all the colour morphs here; leucism, albinism and piebaldism. But, did you know that there are two types of albinism?

Yes, aside from the usual plain white albinos, you can also get (In animals with markings) something called “lavender albinism”. It occurs in servals, but I can’t find any photographs at the moment. However, here’s a picture of a lavender albino snake:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6443c233d2cc5bea0b7366997a3d1c37-lq)

As you can see, the markings show faintly rather than complete whiteness.

There are also one or two more colour mutations in big cats which don’t belong to any of the major series. For example, there’s:

*   Flavism: sadly there are no flavistic big cats with photographs today, but basically what it does is it makes the fur very yellow. This is a flavistic alligator:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f81e811b92b39e4c445c82bfd9559050-lq)

*   Vitiligo: similar to piebaldism superficially, this morph always reminded me of an animal that had been splattered with milk. It occurs in many animals, including dogs and humans, but here’s a puma with vitiligo:

I should remind you that I’ve only spoken of colour morphs that occur in big cats, a topic I know a lot about, but there are loads of other miscolorings in other animals that you might be interested in. Foxes, snakes and domestic cats particularly exhibit a wide range of aberrant colour morphs. Also, there are many even more bizarre mutations in big cats that are only reported fragmentally. For example, there’s the “Peruvian tiger”, once thought to be a new species but discovered to be a jaguar with abnormal colour mutations;

“Among these is the so-called ‘striped tiger’, a reddish, jaguar-sized cat marked with white, unbranched stripes.”

To read more about the Peruvian tiger, I suggest going to this page: [Mystery big cat skulls from the Peruvian Amazon not so mysterious anymore](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/mystery-big-cat-skulls-from-the-peruvian-amazon-not-so-mysterious-anymore/ "blogs.scientificamerican.com")

As said before, there are a plethora of colour mutations in the red fox, which are also grouped into colour series like the big cats’ ones are. This page includes most of them; [https://livingwithfoxes.weebly.com/red-fox-colour-mutations.html](https://livingwithfoxes.weebly.com/red-fox-colour-mutations.html "livingwithfoxes.weebly.com")

That’s about all I can say on the matter, and sorry for the late answer. I know the answer was pretty long, but it kinda had to be for such a massive subject. Thanks for asking!
