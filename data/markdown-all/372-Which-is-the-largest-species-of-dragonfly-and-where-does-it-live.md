Technically, the largest dragonfly is the species Tetracanthagyna plagiata, which you can find in the humid forests and wetlands of Southeast Asia - specifically, in Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.

It’s both the largest dragonfly in terms of weight (roughly 7 grams) and wingspan (17 centimetres). As you can see, it is perfectly camouflaged among branches and leaf-litter on the forest floor.

That being said, there is a species of damselfly - known as Megaloprepus caerulatus \- which has a greater span, measuring 19 cm from wingtip to wingtip. Damselflies are close relatives of dragonflies, but they are still separate groups.

Nevertheless, damselflies are often referred to as dragonflies, so I’ll include this species here. In terms of weight, T. plagiata is definitely bigger but as said M. caerulatus has the bigger wingspan. It’s found in the rainforests of Central and South America.

As an adult, Megaloprepus caerulatus primarily feeds on orb-weaver spiders, while the aquatic larvae eat mosquito larvae. The female lays her eggs in water-filled cavities on the branches of trees, known as phyotelmata.

In prehistoric times, there was an order known as the griffinflies which lasted from about 320 to 252 million years ago. Many griffinflies were much larger than any modern insects - one Permian species had a 70 centimetre wingspan - and resembled dragonflies in many respects, but nevertheless were a distinct, separate group.
