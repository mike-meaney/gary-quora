## Does brain size determine the intellect of a creature? Are there examples of an animal with a small brain being more intelligent than a big brained animal?

By weight alone, no. This is the brain of a blue whale next to a human brain.

As you can see, the whale’s brain is much bigger, but humans are clearly the more intelligent of the two species. In fact, baleen whales - with exception to humpbacks - are thought to be among the dullest of mammals. A larger body naturally requires a larger brain to function normally.

If we compare the size of the brain to the size of the body, then we’re getting somewhere. Have a look at this excellent infographic by a Deviantart user.

If you look closely, you can see three blue lines on the graph. Those represent a value called the EQ, or encephalization quotient - for normal species, the brain grows to the 2/3th power of the body mass.

So, to determine how much fancy bits animals have added one, how much extra intelligence they have, you divide the brain mass by that number. He’s also multipled the number by 0.12 so that the average mammal gets a result of 1, but that’s of course an arbitrary decision.

In any case, the closer an animal is to the uppermost blue line, the higher its EQ, and - to a rough approximation - the more intelligent it should be. Out of the species the artist has selected, humans rank highest, followed by Neanderthals. The best-scoring extant animal is in fact the tucuxi dolphin.

However, EQ is most likely not an objective measure of intelligence. Even on the graph, there are many surprises - sea lions and walruses rival chimpanzees, sun bears are amongst the apes, and manta rays and hammerheads are ridiculously high for fish, right up with the mammals.

One thing also to note is that different brains are structured differently. Bird brains tend to be much more compact and dense, and so they have smaller brains than an equally intelligent mammal probably would. In short, EQ is very helpful, but should not be used as the sole decider of intellect.
