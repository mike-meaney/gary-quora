Lone humans may be weak and slow, but most animals know that, if they kill a person, a mob of angry men, turned barbaric by fear, will chase them and shoot them and kill them.

Edit: Numerous people have pointed out that the animals don't “know”, in the cognitive sense, that humans will retaliate. They are right, and I am aware of that fact - I use “know” in the loosest sense of the word. What I mean is that they are instinctively wired to fear people, like primates are with snakes and spiders.
