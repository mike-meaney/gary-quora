Well, I don’t know about elephants, but I can at least speak for lions.

There have been lions in the St. Louis Zoo, Russia for many years. While those ones do have slightly shaggier coats than their wild counterparts, they seem to manage the winters unperturbed.

The Russian zookeeper Oleg Zubkov said:

> "Everybody of course knows that African lions are heat-loving animals. But not all people know that even in Southern Africa temperatures can drop below zero. African lions are very well adapted to the cold and bear it well. In our lions park they also come out in the snow, have long walks and play, but they have warm winter accommodation where they spend the nights."

Also, consider the lion subspecies; Panther leo spelaea. While extinct today, it is still very closely related to the African lion, and had populations within the Arctic circle:

Note: this map uses the now frowned-upon view that cave and American lions are a separate species

The only problem I can think of is where you would put these beasts. The largest wild area in southern/central Europe is the Białowieża Forest, at about three thousand kilometres squared. However, lions are specialized savanna cats, so you’d need somewhere open and spacious.

Up in Northern Europe, you’ve got plenty of open tundra, but I suspect this may be a tad too cold for non-cared-for African lions.

Thanks for the A2A, and here’s another snowy lion to brighten up your day:
