Yes, although perhaps not the kind of shedding you’re thinking of. They don’t slide out of a translucent sleeve, like snakes.

Instead they shed their scales in little bits. In fact, you might have seen a shedding Komodo dragon in photos before and just not noticed it, since it is a subtle thing. Here are some shedding dragons, with the areas of patchy scales highlighted by me:

It’s difficult to spot in some cases. Generally the older scales are more worn, and paler too. The first one is apparently in the early stages of shedding, while the second one is further into it and the last one is almost done.
