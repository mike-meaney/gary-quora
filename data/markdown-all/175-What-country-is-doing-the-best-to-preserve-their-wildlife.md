In my opinion, it’s Bhutan \- a landlocked Buddhist country in the Eastern Himalayas, about the size of Switzerland. Due to its rugged terrain, it has never been colonized in its entire history, and it’s also the highest country in the world, with an average elevation of 3,280 metres.

The Bhutanese government is based on a philosophy called Gross National Happiness, which would be seen as an alternative to GDP for measuring national progress and development. The philosophy has four pillars, one of which is the conservation of the environment.

In the aim to fulfill this, the government has set aside an astonishing 43% of the country to national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and nature reserves, and a further 9% for wildlife corridors. For comparison, if the USA did this, it would be like dedicating all of Alaska, Texas, California, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada and Colorado to protected areas.

Additionally, the Bhutanese constitution mandates that 60% of the country’s land area must be forested. At the moment, the figure is around 71%, compared to my native Ireland’s 10.5%. There are so many trees in Bhutan that it isn’t just carbon neutral - it’s carbon negative.

While it produces about 1.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, its vast forests sequester about 6 million tonnes of the stuff annually! All of these incredible conservation efforts from the government has led to a nation which is rich in biodiversity.

It’s one of the most promising strongholds for the Bengal tiger, with an estimated 103 in the country. If tigers do go extinct in the near future, the chances are that they’ll last longer in Bhutan than almost anywhere else. They’re found in the warmer, southern half of the country, alongside sloth bears, buffalo and clouded leopards.

In the temperate forests on the Himalayan slopes, there are red pandas, bears, sambar deer and muntjacs. Moving further north and further up the mountains still, the alpine areas are home to snow leopards, wolves, and the takin - a muskox-like beast, pictured below, which is the country’s national animal.

Bhutan also has a wide variety of primate species - including three langurs, two macaques, and the bizarre, venomous Bengal slow loris - and nearly 800 species of birds. Among these feathered friends are the endangered white-winged duck and the critically endangered white-bellied heron, of which there are only about 250 left worldwide.
