Vaguely similar, but with more animals, some species you wouldn’t find today, and very different people. Some highlights of the extinct wildlife include:

*   Hippopotamus gorgops, a relative of the common hippopotamus. Weighing a staggering 3.9 tonnes, it was larger than any hippo today - in fact, it was the largest even-toed ungulate ever to live. Its eyes were on strange stalks which allowed it to see above the water.

*   Metridiochoerus, essentially a warthog on steroids. A close cousin of the modern warthog genus Phacochoerus, it was over 1.5 metres long and had four large, upward-curving tusks. Males are estimated to have weighed 380 kilograms, well over twice the size of the largest extant warthogs!

*   Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni, perhaps the largest crocodile ever to live (you noticing a trend here?). It’s estimated to have been about 8 metres long, and the chances are that it fed on early humans. It’s also perhaps the only animal which would have posed a threat to Hippopotamus gorgops…

*   Sivatherium maurusium, yet another giant. A member of the giraffe family, it more or less resembled a scaled-up okapi with antlers, and its close relative S. giganteum likely weighed about 1,250 kilograms. This would make it the largest ruminant ever to live.

*   Theropithecus brumpti, a close relative of the modern gelada. As you’ve probably guessed by now, it was bigger - in fact, more than twice the size of a large, 20 kg gelada. It also had extremely prominent cheekbones, which were anchor points for frighteningly powerful jaw muscles.

*   Dinopithecus \- basically, it is to baboons what T. brumpti is to geladas. At 46 kilograms in weight, it was one of the largest monkeys ever to live (along with our friend brumpti and a later species, Theropithecus oswaldi). Based on its teeth, it probably ate a lot of fruit, but meat wasn’t off the menu.

Lastly, there were hominins. No Homo sapiens, but some of our predecessors and early relatives, such as the australopithecines Australopithecus anamensis and Paranthropus. It’s also at least possible that the first members of the genus Homo had appeared by now.
