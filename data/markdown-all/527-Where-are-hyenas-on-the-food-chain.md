Well, striped hyenas and brown hyenas are primarily scavengers (Secondary consumers), and eat carrion, human rubbish and small animals. Brown hyenas will sometimes eat fur seal pups where the two species are sympatric. Striped hyenas can kill small-to-medium sized prey such as goats, sheep and sometimes horses.

However, the spotted hyena is a different story. They’re in the same league as lions (Tertiary consumer), and 70 per cent of their food intake comes from active hunting. They’ll eat anything from the like of insects, lizards and birds to buffalo and young rhinos and elephants.

A clan of spotted hyena hunting a rhino

As said above, spotted hyenas are tertiary consumers (Apex predators), so they don’t have any predators besides other tertiary consumers - this essentially means lions in the hyena’s range. One on one, a lion could beat a hyena, but it is thought that this is mainly because of size difference. Research has suggested that if spotted hyenas were as large as lions, they would be equally matched, or perhaps even superior to the big cats. Usually, a group of three to four hyenas will be able to overpower a lioness (Hyenas know this, too - it has been proved that they are intelligent enough to strategically weigh up the odds of a fight based on numbers. When communicating with rival clans, they can tell how many members the opposite clan has by listening to their individual “whoops”, and thus decide whether to engage or not.)

In short, brown/striped hyenas are mainly scavengers, while spotted hyenas are able to defeat almost any prey species in their environment (At some stage in its life). They have no predators, but lions or humans will kill them for reasons other than food.
