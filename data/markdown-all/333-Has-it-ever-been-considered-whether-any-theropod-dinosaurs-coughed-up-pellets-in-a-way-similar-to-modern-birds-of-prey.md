## Has it ever been considered whether any theropod dinosaurs coughed-up pellets, in a way similar to modern birds of prey?

Not only has it been considered, but we have concrete evidence that it did happen! That is, at least in the case of Anchiornis huxleyi, a paravian theropod from northern China which lived around 160 million years ago.

In 2018, a team of Chinese paleontologists unearthed what appeared to be fossilized gastric pellets, found close to Anchiornis skeletal remains. Some of the pellets were even preserved within the throat of the dinosaurs. They contained partially digested lizard bones, and possibly fish scales too.

This isn’t the only thing about Anchiornis we know in incredible detail. The exceptional geological conditions of Liaoning, China have preserved many perfect skeletons of Anchiornis, and even melanosomes, or pigment cells! Because of this, we have a good idea of exactly how this dinosaur was coloured.

It was likely mainly black, with some white on its wings and heels, and a reddish-brown crest on its head. It’s one of the only ancient animals which we know the entire colouration of (save for the tail, in which no preserved pigment cells have been found).

Of course, Anchiornis is outwardly very similar to modern birds - its name translates literally to “near bird” - so it might not be the kind of theropod you’re thinking of. If you’re more referring to the likes of Tyrannosaurus, it’s very improbable that they coughed up pellets, as we have found fragmentary bones in their fossilized feces, also known as coprolites.
