Besides Spiderman? That would be the New Caledonian gecko.

The vast majority of animals which are able to cling to flush walls or ceilings are invertebrates - arthropods like flies and spiders, or gastropods such as snails. There are only three types of vertebrates which are up to the task.

The first are the tree frogs, which are really a handful of clades which independently evolved the same arboreal lifestyle. They secret mucus from the tips of their fingers and toes, allowing them to adhere to tree trunks, branches and leaves.

The second are an incredibly weird and underrated family of mammals known as the myzopodids, or sucker-footed bats. There are only two species in this group, and they’re found only on the island of Madagascar.

On the wrists and ankles of these bats are fleshy cups, and - through secreted fluids and muscle contraction - they allow them to climb the smooth leaves of the traveller’s tree. The leaves are too featureless to be scaled by most arthropods, so sucker-footed bats can sleep without fear of parasites.

Lastly, there are the geckoes, which can grow to larger sizes than either of the previous two animals. In order to climb, these nocturnal reptiles have an ingenius way of sticking to smooth vertical surfaces. Their toes are covered in microscopic hairs called setae, which are arranged in plate-like structures called lamellae.

Essentially, these tiny setae strengthen what are known as van de Waals forces between the toes and the surface, allowing the molecules in the foot to form a weak bond with the molecules in the wall or ceiling. This mechanism could have revolutionary applications in human technology.

The largest of all geckoes are New Caledonian giant geckoes, Rhacodactylus leachianus, sometimes called Leachies. They can be over 35 centimetres in length and weigh nearly half a kilogram. As their name suggests, they’re endemic to the French island of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.

That being said, there is another gecko species from New Zealand, known as the kawekaweau, which measured a hefty 60 centimetres long. However, it went extinct sometime after 1870, and only one specimen of it exists. Personally I find it hard to believe that such a massive animal could adhere to vertical surfaces.

Due to the square cube law, if you increase the size of an animal, its volume will increase at a far faster rate than its external surface area. More volume means more mass, and for that mass to cling to a wall you need a lot more setae.

There is a point where the size of a gecko would require an unreasonable amount of sticky toe-pad area in order for it to climb. The kawekaweau specimen we have doesn’t have comically large feet, so I think it’s safe to say that it didn’t have good adhesion.
