Surprisingly, no. In fact, there’s a whole zoological term for the act of intentionally causing oneself to explode: autothysis. This behaviour is observed in two different groups of animals - ants and termites.

Both are eusocial insects, meaning that most individuals do not reproduce, and are thus genetically “expendable”. It wouldn’t make much evolutionary sense for a normal animal to go around blowing itself up instead of passing on its DNA, after all.

A couple of ant genera use autothysis. The workers of these ants are full of highly corrosive sludge, which they use to their advantage while in combat with rival colonies. When they contract their abdomens, their whole body ruptures, and the substance oozes out.

Of course, they die in the process, but for the greater good of protecting their colony. The yellow goo they release burns any enemy which touches it, and is also very sticky, meaning any other foe which walks in it thereafter may get stuck and perish.

Autothysis is even more widespread in termites, as it is a feature of many species. However, they apply the strategy a little differently. In the case of an attack on the colony, soldiers (or, in some cases, workers) stand at each entrance and rupture their bodies. Their carcasses block all the tunnels into the nest, providing a defensive barrier against the onslaught of rival termites.

One species, Neocapritermes taracua, takes things up a notch by combining the tactics of both ants and other termites. When the workers get old, they become poorly suited to their original duties - ultimately, they are worth more dead than alive.

Copper crystals start to form in a pouch on their abdomen, a deadly backpack, if you will. When the termites self-destruct, they react with chemicals produced by the labial glands to form toxic molecules called benzoquinones.

So, those are two different types of animals which deliberately blow themselves up to protect their colonies. As a fun aside, I’m going to introduce you to a plant which explodes, too: Himalayan balsam. Native to the world’s highest mountain range, it is now considered an invasive pest in many countries.

In order to spread its offspring to new pastures, Himalayan balsam seed pods burst open when ripe, if they are disturbed. Seeds go flying up to seven metres in all directions!

Anyway, that’s all from me for today guys. I hope you enjoyed this shorter-than-usual answer, have a great day!
