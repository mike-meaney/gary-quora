At first glance, tides seem relatively simple. The moon, being such a massive object, exerts quite a lot of gravity on Earth, causing the ocean’s water to be drawn towards it slightly. This creates a “tidal bulge”, shown below (not to scale, of course).

If a marine location is directly under the bulge, it experiences high tide, while if it’s somewhere with no bulge, it’s low tide. There’s also the weaker gravitation pull of the sun to consider (which leads to things like spring tides and neap tides) but overall this isn’t a very complicated principle.

Alas, it’s not that simple of course. If the Earth was a perfect sphere, then the tides would be uniform across its surface, but due to its uneven topography there are many variations. I’m going to focus on an extreme example: the Bay of Fundy in eastern Canada.

This gulf, sandwiched between New Brunswick and the Nova Scotia Peninsula, is home to the most drastic tidal change in the world. At low tide, the water level is up to 21 metres below that of high tide, leaving bare seabed exposed and fishing boats lying on the ground.

This is due to a handful of factors. Firstly, the bay gets narrower and narrower the further in you go. This means that as the tide comes in, water is forced higher as the space around it contracts. At the mouth of the Bay of Fundy, the average tidal range is around 6 metres, but at its deepest recess, it’s over 16.

There’s another factor at play here, too, a rare geographical coincidence. The width of the continental shelf at the Bay of Fundy means that the time it takes for a wave to travel across said shelf is roughly equivalent to one tidal period.

In other words, the natural sloshing and oscillating of the Atlantic is in sync with the tide, amplifying the effect of the latter. This phenomenon is known as tidal resonance, and creates extreme tidal range in the Bay of Fundy, as well as in places like Ungava Bay, also in Canada, and England’s Bristol Channel.

In any case, the powerful tides of the Bay lead to some very interesting phenomena. It’s home to the only tidal power station in North America, harnessing the 160 billion tons of water which pass in and out of it twice daily.

The tide here is also strong enough to produce something known as a tidal bore; a 2 metre tall wave which rolls up rivers (against the course) when the tide comes in. This wave is so stable that one group of surfers were able to ride it for an astonishing 29 kilometres.

Anyway, my main point is this: there are a lot of factors which complicate the seemingly simple concept of tides. This includes the size and depth of the ocean, the shape of the coastline, the dimensions of the continental shelf, and more.

Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoyed.
