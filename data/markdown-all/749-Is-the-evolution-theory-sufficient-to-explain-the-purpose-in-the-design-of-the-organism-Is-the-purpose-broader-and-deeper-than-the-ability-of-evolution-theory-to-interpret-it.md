## Is the evolution theory sufficient to explain the purpose in the design of the organism? Is the purpose broader and deeper than the ability of evolution theory to interpret it?

Evolution is something that, for many, people can be confusing. It is often hard to concieve how the perfectly sculpted hand of a monkey or the complex structure of the eye could ever be created without any sentient, animate design.

But, when you familiarize yourself with the basics of Darwinian evolution, it becomes much more easy to understand.

A famous example often used in explaining his theory is the evolution of the larva of the sphinx moth, Hemeroplanes triptolemus.

This is the famous “snake-mimic caterpillar”. It has evolved something known as “Batesian mimicry”, which is when a harmless animal has features of a harmful one to ward off predators.

When it was discovered by Henry Walter Bates on his expedition to the Amazon, it shocked evolutionists around the world. How could nature craft such an intricate replica on its own? At a time when the vast majority of people were creationists, some believed this to be proof that the Genesis is correct.

Alas, Charles Darwin had an answer. His theory on mimicry and many other phenomena was famously called:

Evolution by Natural Selection

I assume you know the basics of this since you used the term in your answer, but let me walk you through the four principal stages of it and state how it is relevant to the snake mimic.

1.  Overproduction - all species do this. It’s when they produce more offspring than will survive to maturity. Therefore, some moth larva will inevitably not make it past the caterpillar phase.
2.  Variation - when traits of individuals within a species differ. Imagine one day, a caterpillar is born with a couple of black spots on its head vaguely reminiscent of snake eyes.
3.  Selection - when the proportion of individuals in a species with X traits becomes greater because the ones with the less successful Y traits get killed more often. In the caterpillars’ case, the ones with the black spots may seem like snakes to some birds, and get eaten less.
4.  Adaptation - now that the black-spotted caterpillars are more common, they breed with eachother and pass on the black spot genes, which eventually become more and more realistic until,

Hey presto! You have a caterpillar that mimics snakes through Batesian mimicry!

So, what I’m saying here is that evolution, to the finest degree, can theoretically occur without intent, purpose or intelligent design. The astounding preciseness found in animals and plants is a product of millions of years of breeding and natural selection.

Note: While I do believe in evolution, I am not a hard-core atheist. I subscribe to agnosticism, and respect people’s beliefs with an open mind. If you think God created all life as it is today, then I don’t mind and am not telling you what to believe.
