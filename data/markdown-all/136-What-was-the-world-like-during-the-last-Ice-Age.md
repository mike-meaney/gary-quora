Originally answered: What was America like during the last ice age?

The most recent Ice Age occurred in the Pleistocene epoch, a time period which started about 2.6 million years ago and ended just ~11,000 years ago. Though it wasn’t very long ago, the world looked very different back then - the wildlife in particular.

I’m going to assume you’re referring to North America - South America too had some amazing and bizarre fauna in the ice age, which probably deserves an answer of its own.

Much of the continent at the time was buried under the enormous Laurentide Ice Sheet, a mass of ice, miles deep, which extended as far south as Illinois.

Alaska, however, remained largely glacier-free, due to lack of precipitation. As sea levels were much lower (more on that shortly), it was connected to Asia via a landbridge known as Beringia, which allowed animals, and eventually humans, to cross between the two continents.

Today’s Great Lakes, as well as most of Canada’s hundreds of thousands of lakes, were gouged out by the moving ice sheet. And that’s not the only way the great glacier created bodies of water. It was so thick that it redirected moisture-laden winds from the Pacific Ocean further south, to the Southwest region.

As a result of this influx of rainfall, countless lakes formed in California, Nevada, and Utah.

Some of these were vast; Lake Bonneville, for example, was over 50,000 square kilometres in surface area, over twice the size of Lake Erie. Great Salt Lake (pictured above) is the last surviving remnant of Bonneville. And while this region is a blistering desert today, it would have been lush in the Pleistocene.

That being said, most of the world was drier than it is now. Because so much ice was “locked up” in the ice sheets, there wasn’t as much rainwater to go round. This also meant that sea levels were well over 100 metres lower. North America was significantly bigger back then, with Florida being double its modern size:

Anyway, let’s talk about the animals. Whether it be because of human overhunting or climate change (I’m leaning towards the former), they just don’t make ’em like they used to anymore. In the Pleistocene, there were hundreds of large megafauna species roaming the world which have since disappeared.

North America, believe it or not, was home to no less than seven species of elephants and elephant-relatives. There was of course the famous woolly mammoth:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f8f2b23f32d29484a1f55ca147198e89-lq)

And its even larger cousin the Columbian mammoth:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3c0fe30c74cb3dc6dd7488a86963ec5d-lq)

A direct descendant of the Columbian mammoth, the pygmy mammoth, dwelt on Santa Rosae, a “superisland” which has now splintered into the Channel Islands of California. This species was a dwarf, due to its island habitat, standing only 2 metres tall.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-aecd9409e49ad21ee67879e7cc65b118-pjlq)

Other species came from other proboscidean families, more distant and alien to the elephants of today. There were two varieties of mastodon, which had a more elongated frame and shorter legs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9ea27f61aad670fe2b14dc2b650cfe01-lq)

Even stranger were the two surviving species of gomphotheres, which were themselves a separate family. They had huge, spiraling tusks.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4317de5bddc8a39a76bb2a8cac64024f-lq)

These were far from the only huge herbivores in North America. As most areas saw a decrease in precipitation, vast tracts of forest gave way to open grassland, the perfect environment for large grazing animals.

Many of the modern American varieties of plant-eaters were much more diverse. As well as today’s bison species, there was the western bison, the antique bison, the steppe bison and the spectacular long-horned bison:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c34fea9828f9fb994d804061cab8cf3c-lq)

Four different relatives of the muskox co-existed, with the so-called giant muskox being the largest. The pronghorn antelope, too, were very diverse. All three of these once-successful lineages - bison, muskox, pronghorn - have now been reduced to one surviving species.

However, no herbivore group saw as dramatic a reduction in species as the horses. There may have been as many as sixteen differen types of native wild horse in North America, whereas now there are none! My favourite is Equus giganteus, a 1.5 tonne beast which was taller at the shoulder than most horses are at the head.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-99e97ab59bebc653af2a6961d4443366-lq)

Surprisingly enough, there were also camels in North America during the Pleistocene! Camelops was pretty damn big, too, estimated to have weighed around 800 kg.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-010185680260484b157028b549698c8f-lq)

However, perhaps the strangest North American herbivores of all came from a mammal lineage more typical of South America - the xenarthrans. This includes the famous ground sloths, titanic browsers which could weigh up to a staggering 3 tonnes.

Practically every sloth family produced some kind of giant, ground-dwelling variety. In mainland North America, there were at least seven Pleistocene species, the largest being Eremotherium.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8fed39196196c80d4c126eff85ae53a2-lq)

Another xenarthran group, the armadillos, also featured some wacky beasts. There were two separate families of giant armadillos; the glyptodonts and pampatheres. The latter were distinguished by their more flexible armour. The biggest species was Glyptotherium, which measured six feet in length.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d9cc1c6f17ee7f8fdf1b560e53896770-lq)

Speaking of South American animals being found further north, a lot of modern species which we associate with the former continent were found deep into North America too. Llamas, tapirs, capybaras, peccaries, giant anteaters, ocelots, margays, jaguarundis, and more.

One more very cool animal I should mention before I move on to the carnivores; the giant beaver Castoroides. This genus contained two species, which could perhaps grow to weights of 125 kg!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3a8808dc72fa3840bd8ad457cb41de8d-lq)

Okay, now for the North American meat-eaters. The most famous were of course the saber-toothed cats. This included the powerful Smilodon fatalis:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-94ccefafc6f758b025e4c01df805d637-lq)

And the not-quite-so-well-known scimitar cat, Homotherium. There’s evidence that this one may have hunted in groups, like lions do.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9ce48cfe83278e5163e25872cad67ac6-lq)

Earlier on in the Pleistocene, North America was home to other saber-toothed species, such as Dinofelis, Megantereon, Metailurus and the unique Xenosmilus. Xenosmilus was massively built, nearly bear-like, and possibly even walked with a plantigrade gait to support its heavy weight.

Its teeth were triangular and serrated, designed not for quickly dispatching prey, but tearing out chunks of flesh and letting blood loss do the rest. They resemble the teeth of sharks in this respect.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e11dbeba819f130fa19a792f4d3ca1da-lq)

However, these cats had gone extinct by the time human arrived in North America.

In Alaska, there were Eurasian cave lions, which crossed the Bering land bridge. There’s also shaky evidence that there may have been tigers here, if I recall correctly, but it’s certainly not conclusive.

Speaking of lions… the continent had its own special variety, the American lion. About 25% larger than the modern African species, it was one of the largest felines ever to live.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-779a5c4163510008895968b3da3445b5-lq)

There was a North American subspecies of jaguar, too. Known as the giant jaguar, it was significantly larger than its extant counterpart, and ranged as far north as Oregon.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-64ade39823e2abb53b5dc57342e40b69-lq)

And there were American cheetahs! These belonged to a separate genus to the cheetah of today, being significantly larger, but probably behaviourally similar. In fact, they are likely the reason why the pronghorn antelope evolved to run at such breakneck speeds - none of its extant predators can keep up.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1b37fbf81d23219943b811ef376a1c1b-pjlq)

So that covers the felines, but there are also some canines to consider. The most famous would of course be the dire wolf. Once considered to be a close relative of the grey wolf, it’s know considered a separate genus hailing from an American lineage - Aenocyon dirus.

Dire wolves were easily as large as the biggest grey wolves around today, making them one of the largest canid species.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a7de149ec8229a720a01050f8a026955-lq)

In the Pleistocene, grey wolves themselves were supersized. Found in the far northwest of North America (as well as much of Eurasia), the megafaunal wolf was a distinct eco-morph of the wolf species which was adapted for feeding on the much larger wildlife of the time.

It had a bulkier frame, was broader across the snout, and had powerful overdeveloped carnassial teeth. These adaptations allowed it to deliver a very strong bite. They were essentially wolves who took a few leaves out of hyenas’ books.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b8d944fc779cfd7aad8e10071dc6a5b5-pjlq)

The third extinct species of dog in North America was Protocyon. It was a little smaller than a wolf, and its closest living relative is thought to be the strange South American bush dog, which I discuss in further detail in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-strangest-animals-in-the-Brazilian-Amazon/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"). It likely hunted in packs, and bite marks show it preyed on giant armadillos.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8f5b82f67cbf719c7c31cae005a6cb87-lq)

Interestingly enough, the continent was also home to dholes. These reddish hunting dogs are not extinct, but are confined to Asia today. They once occupied much of Europe and North America too.

Then you had the bears. There were several different species of short-faced bears, which had blunt, truncated snouts designed for delivering bone-cracking bite force. The largest of all, Arctodus simus, was one of the biggest land-dwelling carnivorous mammals in history.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e8ce68a7e1017bde0dcc4c4e71dd15a8-lq)

Of course, there were predators not only on the land but also in the air. Birds of prey known as teratorns reigned over the skies in Pleistocene North America. They were some of the most massive birds ever to fly - one mysterious species, Aiolornis incredibilis, has an estimated wingspan of over five and a half metres!

Originally they were thought to be scavengers, like vultures, but now the consensus is that teratorns were largely ground-dwelling predators which snapped up small animals and swallowed them whole.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-52482fea5e5d613e8a2d250f41c6ec2d-lq)

And they weren’t the only big birdies around. There were quite a few giant condors, as well as the huge Woodward’s eagle. It was at least as large as the largest living eagle, the harpy eagle, and its wingspan exceeded that of even the heaviest eagle of all time, New Zealand’s Haast’s eagle.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c52f577d0adb234ab5f7fa0c8d0ef4ed-lq)

Even more unusual was Daggett’s eagle, which was actually a hawk. Its wings were quite short, and its legs very long, adapted for walking long distances. This means it probably lived a similar lifestyle to the charismatic secretarybird of Africa. It stood up to 90 cm tall.

So, all that covers mainland North America, but I haven’t yet touched on the Caribbean Islands. Wildlife-wise, these were a veritable different planet in the Pleistocene. The lower sea levels meant that most islands were much bigger, with more room to accommodate megafauna.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d467c3c5f76b31fcb2bb30bc1fc5f0bf-lq)

However, they were still islands, and many of the animals there which had migrated from the mainland experienced insular dwarfism.

The ground sloths, for example, were much smaller than the gargantuan species offshore. The largest Caribbean sloth weighed “only” 90 kilograms. Some of them may have even been partially arboreal. These sloths may actually be the reason that today’s Cuban crocodile has adaptations for hunting on land.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0794c3ca865d5a5c5128699a5f69b412-lq)

See this [answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-various-types-of-crocodiles/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") for more explanation on that.

In the Caribbean, there were also diverse radiations of monkeys and gigantic rodents called giant hutia. The largest one may have weighed up to 200 kg, or more than triple the weight of the biggest living rodent! Now that’s what I call a Rodent of Unusual Size.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-aaa2ee08524c36cf11114b8b87238bbf-lq)

However, the most amazing thing about the Pleistocene Caribbean was not its mammals nor its crocodiles but its bird life. The feathered friends of these islands evolved flightlessness many times…

There was the giant flightless crane Grus cubensis, the flightless owl Ornimegalonyx, which was the largest owl ever to live (standing over a metre tall and weighing 30 kg):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6d305bf1eb75d842514c1105eef8664f)

The flightless Jamaican caracara, one of the only birds of prey ever which couldn’t fly:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8a8816141aa264cdd02872fbe9b5a007-lq)

And, most interesting of all, the flightless Jamaican ibis. This bird had heavy bony outgrowths on its wings, which it used as club-like weapons for fighting.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ba4093287e4506882bb6f7340f482415-pjlq)

There were also flightless ibises in Hawaii at the time, which had its own wacky birdlife, which I shall very quickly detail. I suppose you could consider it part of North America.

In addition to this ibis, Apteribis, there were a handful of species of moa-nalo, odd, goose-like ducks. Speaking of geese, there was a giant species aptly named the giant Hawaii goose:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3a28df674a71db64767f00a4d34171dc-lq)

And, weirdest of all, the Kauai mole duck. I would sum this one up as a feathered platypus - it was flightless, probably blind and nocturnal, and it navigated its surroundings by touch and smell using its huge, flat beak.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c9c443f528ca0fca12ef5d316b5dae78-lq)

There were plenty of other extinct animals found in Hawaii from this time period, including a bat (one of only two known native Hawaiian land mammals), but none were as interesting as the birds described above.

So, that about covers the entire North American continent during the Pleistocene epoch. There are so many other Ice Age regions I'd love to talk about — the Pampas, Patagonia, Doggerland, the mammoth steppe, the green Sahara, East Africa, Madagascar, India, China, Japan, Indonesia, Sahul, New Zealand, Fiji, New Caledonia and more. But they'll have to wait.

Thank you very much for soldiering through this very long answer, I hope you got some enjoyment out of it, have a great day.
