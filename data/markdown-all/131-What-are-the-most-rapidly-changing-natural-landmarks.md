This lake is the fourth-largest lake in the world - it’s more of an inland sea, in fact. It spans some 68,000 square kilometres, and its waters are home to nearly 40 different species of fish. On the shore of this lake, there is an enormous fishing industry which employs tens of thousands of people.

Or at least, there was a time when all this was true. Since then, this has happened to the bountiful sea:

I’m talking about the Aral Sea, what was once a lake straddling the border of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan. Since the ‘60s, it’s been rapidly drying up - in the ‘80s, it split into the North and South Aral Seas, and by now it’s become a few tiny remnants of what it once was.

The first and most important question which comes to mind is “How did this happen?” It started in the early 1960s, when the Aral Sea was part of Khrushchev's USSR. The Soviet government wanted to make cotton - or “white gold”, as they called it - a major export, and decided to transform much of the Karakum Desert into the agricultural land for growing cotton.

To do this, they diverted the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers - which feed the Aral Sea - away from the lake, to irrigate the arid plains. It is this which would spell doom for the vast expanse of water, and the Soviets knew this well. Many claimed that the Sea was “nature’s error”, and that it would have evaporated regardless.

Over the course of the next three decades, the lake shrunk by 60%, and became saltier than the Dead Sea. The ecosystems in the Aral, as well as in the deltas flowing into it, were decimated. Most of the area the lake once occupied has become a dry wasteland, tortured by dust storms like the one pictured below.

Did I mention that the whole place is toxic, too? As the desertification of the land dramatically reduced the quality of the soil, local farmers had to use far more pesticides than health limits suggest. As a result, the entire region is heavily polluted, and tuberculosis, cancer, anaemia and more are rampant.

Additionally, the economy has been destroyed. The settlements on the shores of the Aral Sea had always depended on fisheries, and they did well for it - the industry employed some 40,000, and produced a sixth of the entire Soviet Union’s fish catch. Now, however, the fishing towns lie in deserts, kilometres away from water, and have long been abandoned.

There might still be hope for the Aral Sea, however. Kazakhstan has made an ongoing effort to save the North Aral Sea, and by 2008, the water level had risen by 12 metres. The lake isn’t absurdly saline anymore, and even commercial fishing is at least somewhat viable. However, the South Aral Sea has sadly been abandoned to its fate and left to evaporate.

I think that the story of the Aral Sea should serve as a glaring wake-up call to those who doubt how much impact we have on the planet. In a matter of decades, we nearly erased one of the most enormous lakes in the world - just by diverting two rivers. The best we can do now is rescue what’s left.
