## What are some examples of small local populations of a certain wildlife species that act or do something in a very different way than the rest of the world's population of that species?

That’s a very interesting question, and I certainly know some good candidates. Here are my favourite examples.

*   On the coast and offshore islands of British Columbia and the Alaskan Panhandle, there are populations of grey wolves which feed almost exclusively on maritime prey, such as fish, barnacles, clams, caviar, seal pups and occasionally even whale carcasses. They also swim much more frequently than inland wolves and are possibly a genetically distinct clade.

*   In Gabon, there is a population of the African dwarf crocodile which is found exclusively in underground caves. These subterranean crocs are generally larger than their surface cousins, and are often orange in colour due to alkaline bat droppings eroding their skin. It’s thought that they eat cave crickets, bat guano and quite possibly live bats. They too are seemingly genetically distinct, and may be in the process of speciation.

*   There is one species of freshwater seal in the world, and two Finnish subspecies of ringed seal which live in lakes. Much less talked about, however, are the lake-dwelling populations of harbour seals. There is one in Iliamna Lake, Alaska, and another in Lac de Loups Marins in Quebec. The former population has been the subject of a heated debate over whether it should recieve special conservation attention due to its uniqueness.

*   Killer whales can be categorized into different ecotypes or races, which vary in appearance, behaviour and diet. Currently, there are ten known types, with five in each hemisphere. The largest of these is the Antarctic Type A orca. Up to 9.7 metres long, these killer whales feed mainly on one species - the minke whale.

At the moment, those four are the main ones I can think of. Hopefully you’ve enjoyed reading the answer, thanks for asking.
