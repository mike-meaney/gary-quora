The Fitzroy River turtle

The Fitzroy River turtle looks fairly standard superficially, but they have a unique adaptation which sets them apart as very weird animals. Simply putâ€¦

They can breathe through their anus.

This process, known as cloacal respiration, means that 70% of the oxygen they get is inhaled through the anus, and that they can stay underwater for literal weeks. However, their breathing hole is of course plugged when they defecate, so they need to switch primarily to conventional inhalation during that time.
