## Of all the main large African predators (lion, hyena, leopard, cheetah, crocodile, etc.) where do they place on the food chain from highest to lowest?

It’s hard to tell, because ecosystems don’t really work in linear chains (Those are more or less to show relationships between a few organisms with distinct trophic levels.). More accurate are food webs, as they account for differing ecological niches.

Lions occupy the apex predator niche (Along with hyenas, more on that in a bit) in most ecosystems in their range, because they hunt in prides. In prides, their hunting success rate is about 30%.

Females hunt cooperatively to catch smaller, more agile prey, but males are present when hunting large game such as buffalo, rhinoceros and elephant.

Crocodiles are the largest of the mentioned carnivores, and have the most powerful bite. However, they are low-energy, ectothermic animals, and thus have poor agility. To quote Wikipedia:

> When it comes to larger prey, success depends on the crocodile's body power and weight to pull the prey item back into the water, where it is either drowned or killed by sudden thrashes of the head or by tearing it into pieces with the help of other crocodiles.

In any case, I believe that the “death-roll” tactic is a very successful behaviour.

Spotted hyenas, despite being reputed as scavengers, are in fact very effective hunters. They are confirmed to live in groups of up to 80 (During some of my trips to Africa, locals have told me that they live in clans of over 100, but there is no scientific documentation for this.). Their jaws are more powerful than any African animal except hippos and lions, and have been known to chew through iron bars.

I cannot find a source for their hunting success rates, as they are often shunned by scientists on the basis of their foul reputation. Hyenas are highly intelligent and have outperformed primates in cooperation tests.

Leopards are solitary and usually tackle small to medium size prey. They have dealt with the problem of carcass defense differently to lions, which became social, by climbing trees.

Their success rates differ between individuals. A lone male may only succeed 14% of the time, while a lone female can be succeed in up to 38% of hunts.

Cheetahs, if we were to present this information in a linear chain, would probably rank the lowest. It is only by chance that they are with us today, as they experience genetic bottlenecks and are over-specialized. They are the most successful of the predators I have mentioned so far, but are very often robbed by brawnier carnivores such as leopards and lions.

The last large carnivore in Africa is the African wild dog, or painted dog. These are by far the most successful of the 6 predators, triumphing 85% of the time, and is actually not far off holding the crown for the most successful predator in the world (Dragonflies have a 90–95% record).

They hunt in groups and rarely come into conflict with their pack mates, hunting small-to-medium size prey.

So, the point of all this is that rather than a single food chain - this eats this which eats this which eats this - ecosystems work as a complex web, with different animals hunting different prey in different ways. If I was to draw a rough diagram of the relationships between these predators, it would look something like this;

Yeah… stuff is complicated. Anyway, since you asked for a food chain, I’ll give you a rough “power ladder” of their killing capabilities;

Crocodile (rarely eats predators though)

Lion and hyena

Wild dog

Leopard

Cheetah

Well that’s enough from me. Thanks for asking, hopefully I answered your question well.
