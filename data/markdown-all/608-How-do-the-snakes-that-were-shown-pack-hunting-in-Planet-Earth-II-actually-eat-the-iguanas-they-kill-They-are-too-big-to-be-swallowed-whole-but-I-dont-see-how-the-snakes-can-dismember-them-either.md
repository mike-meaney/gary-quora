## How do the snakes that were shown pack hunting in Planet Earth II actually eat the iguanas they kill? They are too big to be swallowed whole, but I don't see how the snakes can dismember them either.

According to Wikipedia, a hatchling marine iguana weighs 40â€“70 grams, easily small enough for a snake of comparable size to a Galapagos racer to consume. All snakes have hinges where their mandibles attach to the temporal bone, so that they can eat things much larger than their normal head volume.

Also, Google has plenty of pictures of Galapagos racers eating marine iguanas.
