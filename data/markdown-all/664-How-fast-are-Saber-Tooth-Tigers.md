When you say “saber tooth tiger”, I assume you mean a member of the subfamily Machairodontinae, rather than saber-toothed nimravids or barbourofelids.

If we look at modern big cats, we see that there are fast forms (E.g. cheetah - 120 km/h), and slower forms (E.g. leopard - 58 km/h). However, I doubt that any saber tooth cat could reach cheetah speed, because of the cheetah’s light build.

It’s essentially an overgrown small cat, and Machairodonts are usually big and stocky. It seems speed is important for the saber-tooths, though, because of their unique canines.

It’s thought, but not confirmed, that they would pounce on their prey, go straight for the top of the neck, and knock out the four major blood vessels with one stroke. The saber-tooths actually had a fairly weak bite, so they would use their neck muscles to deliver a quick, killing shear.

For example, a spotted hyena has incredibly powerful jaws, and it essentially eats its prey alive, biting again and again and crushing bone. This is partially because they don’t have flexible wrists that can grapple onto the prey to hold it still while it makes a quick, killing bite.

Note: Both buffalo are alive

So, since they couldn’t simply just bash away at prey until they gave in, they would need a quick burst of speed. If I had to estimate, I’d say a large saber tooth cat species would be able to hit 80 km/h (Twice as fast as Usain Bolt) in short bursts.
