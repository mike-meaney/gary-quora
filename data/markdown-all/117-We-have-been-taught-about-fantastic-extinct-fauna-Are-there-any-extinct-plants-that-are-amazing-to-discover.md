The Ancient Greek city of Cyrene, on the coast of modern Libya, was special because of one prized plant. The Romans said it was worth its weight in silver. Others believed it was a gift from the god Apollo. In fact this plant was so significant that its branching stalk was etched onto almost all Cyrenian currency.

Its name was silphium, and its supposed uses were myriad. It was used as seasoning for food, as medicine for the ill, as an aphrodysiac and even as a form of contraception. Pliny wrote that it “purged” the body of “all vicious humours”. Both the civilizations of Crete and Egypt had a unique glyph in their languages’ writing systems for silphium.

Clearly, this was a very valuable and versatile commodity in the Mediterranean region during Classical times. However, it’s seemingly extinct now, and we still don’t know for sure why, or even what kind of plant it is. However, it was almost certainly in the umbellifer family, Apiacae, which contains carrots, celery and parsley.

The most common hypothesis is that it was some kind of giant fennel (Ferula), although alternative identities have been proposed. As said, the nature of silphium’s extinction is also mysterious - it may have been as a result of overgrazing from livestock, over-picking by humans, or worsening soil/climate conditions.

Another tidbit I find quite interesting is that it’s been suggested that the heart symbol - ♥ - originally came from silphium. Their seed pods, which are shaped exactly like said symbol, are also often found on Cyrenian coins. Given their alleged properties as an aphrodysiac and birth control, it’s possible that this association with love gave rise to the traditional heart symbol.

So, in the days of antiquity there was a miracle cure plant which was circulated and prized all around the Mediterranean, but disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Old coins, ancient manuscripts, and perhaps even a universally-known symbol of love are its only legacy today.

I suppose it’s not as freakish or spectacular as some of the extinct animals we hear a lot about, but it’s still quite fascinating in its own way. Thanks everyone for reading, have a great day.
