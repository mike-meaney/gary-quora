You’ve almost certainly seen a daddy longlegs before. You know, the little brown, spider-like critters with huge legs that you find scurrying about on walls? Many probably think them dull, boring animals - and, to a certain degree, that’s true - at least in the likes of Europe and the US.

When you get nearer the equator, daddy longlegs get a whole lot more exciting. To name a few…

It’s a pity we don’t have any daddy longlegs like these this far north. By the way, despite what you may have heard, they aren’t spiders (they have their own group, Opiliones), and [they aren’t venomous](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/1750151/daddy-long-legs-spider-venom-bite-poison/ "www.thesun.co.uk"). Thanks for reading.
