Well, it depends on the scale of your view of the animal kingdom. Compared to all living things, yes, they are related, but closely - no.

Hereâ€™s a list of taxa that include both giant sloths and dinosaurs:

1.  Living things
2.  Eukaryota (Cells with a nucleus)
3.  Animalia (Animals)
4.  Chordata (Vertebrates and some closely related invertebrates)
5.  Vertebrata (Vertebrates)
6.  Tetrapoda (Vertebrates with four limbs)
7.  Amniotes (Tetrapods whose eggs have an amniose

But this is where their paths split. Dinosaurs belong to the class Reptilia, while sloths fall into the clade Synapsida (Mammals and proto-mammals).
