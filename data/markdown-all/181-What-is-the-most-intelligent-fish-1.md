Manta rays are a strong candidate for this title. They have one of the highest brain mass to body mass ratios of any fish. While this figure - the “encephalization quotient” - can be unreliable when comparing very different types of animals, when you contrast manta rays with other fish it’s clear that their brains are a cut above the rest.

They also showcase behavioural signs of intelligence on par with many mammals. They are curious and seem to maintain close social bonds. Captive manta rays are also one of the few animals that appear to recognize themselves in mirrors. This does not necessarily mean they are self-aware, as is often claimed, but I think it at least shows a higher level of understanding.

Other cartilaginous fish such as sharks also display very large brains in comparison to lobe-finned and ray-finned fish. In the captive environment, tests have shown they respond with curiosity and playfulness towards unfamiliar objects, have good learning skills, and can retain memories for long periods of time.

In the wild, they’ve been observed carrying out creative hunting strategies, such as leaping out of the water to catch birds flying overhead, or dragging a dead whale to deeper waters so it stops floating upwards. Sharks can also recognize the faces of specific human divers or the shape of specific boats.

Several species of fish are also known to make use of tools in the wild. Two species of tuskfish (one is pictured below) and quite a few species of wrasse use hard objects like coral as “anvils”, banging seashells against them until they crack open, or smashing the spines off venomous urchins.

However, some scientists argue that this is not true tool use, as the “tool” is attached to the sea floor and not really manipulated by the fish. Nevertheless, there are behaviours which fit this more restrictive definition.

Various South American freshwater fish such as the banded acara, as well as the brown hoplo catfish (pictured), have a habit of adhering all their eggs to a leaf, and then carrying that leaf around in their mouth, like a tray. Unfortunately I don’t think this behaviour has been photographed yet.

The last group of fish I’m going to talk about are the elephantfish. These African freshwater fish get their name from their elongated snouts. Not only are they notable for having a very high EQ (encephalization quotient, see first paragraph), their brains consume the most oxygen relative to the rest of the body of any vertebrate!

What’s even more interesting about them - and what almost ventures into the realm of science fiction - is that they can communicate with each other by generating and detecting weak electric fields. This form of communication seems to be surprisingly sophisticated, and each individual elephantfish produces a unique electric discharge. This is almost certainly the reason for their supercharged brains.

There’s a lot more I could say about elephantfish, from their unique ear anatomy to how they convergently evolved with the knifefishes of South America, but I’ll leave it at that for now. I should probably write a full answer on them one of these days.

Anyway, those are some examples of fish displaying more intelligent behaviour than most people would have ever thought they were capable of. It’s very hard to say which of them has the most advanced cognition, but based on the evidence gathered thus far I would say manta rays. Elephantfish show promise but I don’t think they have been studied thoroughly enough just yet.

Thank you very much for reading everybody, have a great day.
