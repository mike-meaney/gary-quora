The largest known wolverines have been measured to weigh in at over 30 kg, making them the largest land-dwelling mustelids, with one freak specimen reportedly being 35 kilos.

They have an incredibly thick and cold-resistant coat, which is coated in hydrophobic oils, and their huge upper molars curve inwards so as to tear even the toughest of flesh.

As for wolves? Technically, all domestic dogs are members of the grey wolf species, and I can’t see a wolverine having any trouble with a chihuahua, but that’s cheating. The average male grey wolf isn’t much larger than outsized wolverines, at about 40 kg, but the largest known specimen was twice that size.

It’s also worth noting that the grey wolf is the most common predator of the wolverine in the wild by far, accounting for a large portion of the latter species’ mortality.

So, does the wolverine have a chance? Despite its apparent great disadvantage, I think it’s highly plausible that a large one could kill a rather large wolf.

There are many accounts of wolverines slaying animals which absolutely dwarf them in size. Occasionally, they bring down moose, during the winter when they are weaker and bogged down with thick snow. In this respect, their small size is crucial, as they can walk on top of snow without falling through.

There are actually numerous accounts of lone wolverines killing adult polar bears, the largest land carnivores on Earth. One alleged incident occurred in an unknown zoo some time before 1930, and another on Alaskan sea ice in 1944. Both times, the wolverine was said to latch onto the bear’s throat and suffocate it.

Of course we should take these reports with a healthy dosage of salt. The first event is referenced in scientific literature, but none of the papers mentioning it are available online, and the original source is nowhere to be seen. The second was witnessed by a man whose son later recounted it to a journalist, seemingly years later.

I thought they’d be interesting to bring up nonetheless.

The strongest evidence, I think, pointing towards wolverines’ wolf-killing abilities would be footage of skirmishes between the two. There’s [this one from last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2Qc8_mgGuk "www.youtube.com") and [another from 2006.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Ryzqw6ZPE4 "www.youtube.com") In both cases, the confrontation is initiated by the much larger wolf, but the wolverine fights back, causing the former to abandon the attempt.

If these two incidents show that a wolverine can hold its own against a wolf for long enough to convince the latter to give up, I can’t see why a particularly feisty one couldn’t defeat a wolf in a fight to the death.

Anyway, thanks for reading, hopefully you found this interesting. Have a great day.
