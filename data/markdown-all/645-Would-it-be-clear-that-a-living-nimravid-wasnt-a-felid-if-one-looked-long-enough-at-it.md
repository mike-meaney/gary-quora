## Would it be clear that a living nimravid wasn't a felid if one looked long enough at it?

I’d say that to a mammalogist or paleontologist, quite possibly.

For one thing, the nimravids had shorter legs and tails than cats. There were cats with short tails, like some saber-tooths, but no extant ones.

Here’s a comparison between a barbourofelid and a machairodont:

You can see here that the forelegs are held lower to the ground in the nimravid. You can also see that the thoracic spikes are just as high as the lumbar spine vertebrae, whereas in cats usually they are higher or lower. This is more internal anatomy, but it’d still be visible superficially.

If the nimravid in question is a barbourofelid, then I’d say that you’d definitely know it wasn’t a cat. The strange projections of the jaw for the saber-teeth to slot into haven’t been observed in any cats.

However, these would only be observed if we knew that there was a non-felid group with these characteristics. If people never knew what a nimravid was, then I’d say no; they’d just assume it was a strange cat.

Thanks for the A2A, I hope I answered your question well.
