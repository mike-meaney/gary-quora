## What was Africa like during the ice age/pleistocene? We usually never hear about Africa at this time.

Out of the six inhabited continents of the world, Africa and its wildlife have been the least damaged by the end-Pleistocene extinction. This is likely due to the fact that African fauna evolved alongside human hunter-gatherers, and, thus, prey animals were already adapted to coexisting with Homo sapiens. However, the Pleistocene lasted over 2 million years, and in that time, much has changed.

It being an Ice Age, the temperatures were much lower, and thus it generally took longer for water to evaporate and form clouds. In other words, the water cycle was slowed down, and rainfall levels decreased accordingly. Most of Africa’s tropical forests gave way to drier savannahs, although, surprisingly, the Sahara Desert was sometimes less arid…

Around 14.5 thousand years ago, a change in the Earth’s orbit caused a strengthening of the annual monsoon of West Africa, which in turn brought the so-called African Humid Period upon the continent. With more precipitation directed to the Sahara region, dry sands became grasslands, and low-lying basins filled up with water to become vast lakes.

Lake Chad is actually a remnant of one such Pleistocene lake, one which was so big it was practically an freshwater sea. Lake Mega-Chad, as it is known, was over a million square kilometres in area, absolutely dwarfing the Caspian Sea (the largest modern lake). Chad today is over 700 times smaller than this, and sadly continues to evaporate.

This African Humid Period lasted beyond the end of the Pleistocene, only coming to a close five or six thousand years ago. Before the Sahara returned to its arid state, there were even agricultural civilizations living there.

These people have left behind a wealth of artwork, daubed onto sandstone rock. Cave paintings in Tassili n’Ajjer, Algeria, show a rich selection of wildlife including buffalo, rhinoceroses, hippos and elephants, none of which live there anymore.

Another location in Egypt, known as the Cave of Swimmers, seems to depict people swimming in water. Today, there are no rivers or lakes anywhere near there, so it must have been much more humid at the time.

This all happened after glacial times, though, so let’s get back to the question. In the modern world, Africa has more large megafauna than any other region, this being the reason it’s such a popular safari destination.

However, there are still plenty of interesting animals which lived there in the Pleistocene epoch, but are now extinct. Here are some of my favourites.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-305463447d97b4adc6026d498e497159-lq)

*   Pelorovis, a hefty buffalo-like beast whose magnificent horns each measured up to two metres in length.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-adc3115d7d3e9519fdd38401b4b58911-lq)

*   Rusingoryx, a wildebeest relative. It had a domed nasal cavity containing a complex network of passages, enabling it to produce deep, infrasound honking calls.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c33e6cf8fc925defe1c1bd9c6ee12fc2-lq)

*   Dinopithecus, the largest monkey of all time. This brutish baboon may have weighed as much as 77 kg.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bdb9d45807ae169f52de21a182309825-pjlq)

*   Megalotragus, an antelope which stood an impressive 1.4 metres at the shoulder. It was twice the size of a modern wildebeest!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a776dee579557679a2cedf49459076f6-lq)

*   The quagga, a South African subspecies of the plains zebra famous for its unusual colouration. It only went extinct in 1883.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3c7474ef186e13bd37863f1d722735f3-lq)

*   Bos buaiensis, a massive cow from Eritrea which had a similar horn-span to the aforementioned Pelorovis.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-07a6cfcea0e5184e783104b15f1fb828-lq)

*   The Natodomeri lions, a mysterious extinct population of African lions which were extremely large, much bigger than any extant lion. Anyone who’s seen The Ghost and the Darkness will be chilled by this.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-90df3985062b18b8db779b8001469c67-lq)

*   Xenocyon, a hyper-carnivorous canine which was about the size of a wolf. It was probably the ancestor of the African wild dog of today, as well as the dhole.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-71df48f145ec6fa0e47dd8526b178010-lq)

*   Pachycrocuta, a giant hyena the size of a lion. Like the modern spotted hyena, it was probably an active predator, not a scavenger.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1e221a6e3edea540115f38778b8f32f2-lq)

*   Theropithecus, a relative of the modern gelada of Ethiopia which was over twice as large. It had freakishly prominent cheekbones, which were anchor points for enormous jaw muscles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b261820b957c6aa4757bf95528663901-pjlq)

*   Hippopotamus gorgops, a supersized relative of the modern hippo which, weighing 3.9 tonnes, was the largest known even-toed ungulate ever to live. Its eyeballs were set on weird stalks, allowing it to see above water when submerged.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4e10e2c7e632bf332f0f4cd6b1e221c9-lq)

*   Metridiochoerus, a giant warthog, which had four vicious-looking tusks curving up from its jaws.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-817ae58eafd296f259254dff0e0553df-lq)

*   Crocodylus thorbjarnarsoni, likely the largest true crocodile ever to walk the Earth. It measured a staggering 8 metres in length!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dcff8d5dda0c5244625db9d55efe3915-lq)

*   Sivatherium, essentially a giant okapi with moose antlers. It weighed well over a tonne and may have been the largest ruminant of all time.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-41cefa68deaa7acf1f7f0190fdced3f0-lq)

*   A variety of different hominin species - that is, other species of human, the most famous being Australopithecus. There were also members of the Paranthropus and Homo genera.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8a4cf638986facfd839bcd70a0f1ae8d-lq)

*   Various saber-toothed cats, including Homotherium, a.k.a. the scimitar cat, Megantereon, Machairodus and Dinofelis. The last species is famous for being a known predator of human ancestors.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-79d09a11fc8de2a04c640df9bbcd34b3-lq)

*   Agriotherium, one of the largest bears - and indeed largest land-dwelling carnivorans - ever to live. It weighed around 900 kg.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d8897d44efa6a300d3a2d5f64ec1d312-pjlq)

*   Deinotherium, a strange distant relative of elephants. Skeletal remains of Deinotherium were mistakenly thought by the ancient Romans to be those of a legendary tribal king known as Teutobochus.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-41327d6e81a53d4f2ef58816535f6170-lq)

*   Panthera gombazgoensis, a mysterious big cat which has attributes of jaguars, lions and tigers. Most specimens are known from Europe; the specimen from Africa may in fact be a different, undiscovered species.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f3ff9342b84eb6bdb655383dabf99936-lq)

*   Makapania, an odd-looking herbivore similar to modern muskox and takins. Its horns were especially unique.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cf73b2d7fd29ec7c4ceab66774511962-lq)

*   Viverra leakeyi, a giant civet which was around the size of a leopard. It’s the largest known viverrid of all time.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5b7471e50a8f8ecd4311dbe8007ee55a-lq)

*   The African giant buffalo, Syncerus antiquus. It was once thought to be a species of Pelorovis, our first animal, and it was the largest ever African bovine, weighing up to two tonnes!

So, while the fauna of Africa today is absolutely breathtaking - I’ve had the privilege of witnessing much of it firsthand - a lot has changed since the Pleistocene. I would love to go on a prehistoric safari and see all this super-sized wildlife.

All that isn’t even touching on the extinct animals of Madagascar, which are even more exotic and fascinating. I also omitted the Canaries, and the Seychelles, for the sake of time. I suppose they’ll have to be a story for another time…
