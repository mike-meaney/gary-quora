Well, time to answer this, but in animal edition.

Honey badgers have a symbiosis with honeyguides

It’s a commonly cited “example” of symbiosis that ratels, or honey badgers, follow honeyguide birds and are led to bees’ nests. The honey badger then breaks open the nest, eats its fill of honey, and the bird gets all the leftovers.

Though it’s been written about and presented as fact countless times, there is no evidence that this happens. The myth originated in 1785 when a man called Anders Sparrman heard it from locals, but it’s never been observed scientifically.

Polar bears have fiber optic fur

This myth is very widely believed, and to be honest it does “sound” like something that would be true, superficially. The idea essentially is that a polar bear’s hairs can guide sunlight towards its skin where it will be absorbed as heat.

However, it’s simply not possible for a fiber of any kind to collect light from literally any direction and then somehow guide it along its axis. A variation of this myth also exists for baby harp seals, and has even been stated in one of the most complete [treatises](https://www.amazon.com/Pinnipeds-Seals-Sea-Lions-Walruses/dp/0520064984 "www.amazon.com") on pinnipeds in the world.

Daddy longlegs have the most potent venom of all spiders

First of all, daddy longlegs aren’t spiders at all (although, confusingly, daddy long-legs with a hyphen are), they’re distant relatives better-known to zoologists as harvestmen. Anyway, the myth goes that these arachnids have incredibly toxic venom, but lack the fangs to deliver it.

Let me just say, what kind of idiot made that up? Not someone who knows anything about Darwinian evolution, anyway. As you would think, daddy longlegs have no venom, because they don’t have fangs.

Those are just three of a great many tall tales about animals which are very widely believed and parroted, yet have no truth to them. Some of these are so common that even a handful of zoologists probably take them to be true.
