Thanks for the A2A and sorry for the late answer. Personally, I think there are a few misconceptions regarding the Carboniferous period, an episode in geological time lasting from roughly 359–289 million years ago.

*   Myth #1: the Carboniferous was “ruled by giant arthropods”

It’s true that there were some giant terrestrial arthropods in the Carboniferous. However, there are only a few such species known - Meganeura, Arthropleura, Pulmonoscorpius, and a couple of large griffinflies. Meanwhile, there are a host of fossils of megafaunal amphibians, reptiles, and even synapsids from the period.

In any case, it seems as though tetrapods definitely had the upper hand, and were far more dominant and diverse.

*   Myth #2: the arthropods got so big because of oxygen levels

It’s widely cited that it was the level of oxygen in the atmosphere (which was about 1.5 times that of today’s) that prompted these invertebrates to grow to such sizes. However, that hypothesis has of late fallen out of favor - for in fact, the largest-ever insect was Meganeuropsis, from the Permian period.

The Permian atmosphere had a more or less normal oxygen percentage, and furthermore, there was a group of giant insects in the Triassic period, the titanopterans (pictured), when oxygen was at a measly 11%. It seems more likely that insects being huge is normal for Earth, but flying vertebrates outcompeted them.

That is exciting, because it means gigantic bugs could probably survive in Earth’s modern conditions.

*   Myth #3: Earth during the Carboniferous was a hothouse world

Okay, well this is at least partially true. At the start of the period, the climate was very hot, about 20 degrees Celsius on average. However, temperatures quickly started to drop, and by the middle of the Carboniferous, the world averaged around 12 degrees, colder than our current 14.

The climate continued to drop, and the ice caps to expand, until eventually the Earth entered an ice age and much of the rainforests disappeared, resulting in an extinction event known as the Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse.
