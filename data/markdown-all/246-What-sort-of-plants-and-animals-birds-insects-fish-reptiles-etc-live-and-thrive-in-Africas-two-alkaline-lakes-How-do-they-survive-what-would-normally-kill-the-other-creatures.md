## What sort of plants and animals, birds, insects, fish, reptiles, etc. live and thrive in Africa's two alkaline lakes? How do they survive & what would normally kill the other creatures?

There are actually over 20 soda lakes in Africa, with varying levels of alkalinity. Most of them are found in Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia, although you can also find some in Chad, Sudan and Egypt.

The stereotypical idea of a soda lake is one akin to Tanzania’s Lake Natron.

Due to a high rate of evaporation, the lake is essentially encrusted in salt (natron and trona, to be specific), and is teeming with halophilic, or salt-loving, cyanobacteria. These bacteria give the lake its deep red colour.

Natron is certainly an inhospitable environment. Fish can only survive near the shore, where a few species of tilapia can be found. In the deeper waters, the temperature is too high (60 degrees Celsius) and the salt content too high for many organisms.

Lesser flamingoes, however, benefit from the thriving populations of cyanobacteria, and about 2.5 million of them breed at the lake. That’s about three quarters of the entire global population!

Other soda lakes are more welcoming. I’ve actually been to one - Lake Nakuru, in western Kenya. It’s one of the most basic lakes in the world (it has a pH of 10.5), but you wouldn’t think it - Nakuru supports a thriving ecosystem. The photos below are all taken by me.

In the waters themselves, there are scores of both lesser and greater flamingoes (though not as many as there were - shifting water levels due to climate change have driven many of the birds to nearby Lake Bogoria).

In addition to great white pelicans,

African darters, great cormorants,

Black-crowned night herons, grey herons,

Pied kingfishers,

African fish eagles,

And hippos. Unfortunately, the only hippopotamus I saw in Lake Nakuru was dead, and looking a bit bloated from the buildup of gases.

In the savannas and forests surrounding the lake, there’s a wide variety of birds and mammals to be found, from buffalo to buzzards.
