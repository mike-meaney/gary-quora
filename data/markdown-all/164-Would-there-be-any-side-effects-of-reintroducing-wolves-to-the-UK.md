A good case study to answer this question would be the reintroduction of the grey wolf to Yellowstone National Park. A long time ago, the northern Rocky Mountains wolf was extirpated from the region by humans. The disappearance of such an important predator sent ripples through the ecosystem which had far-reaching consequences.

With nothing to hunt them and keep their numbers in check, the population of elk in Yellowstone skyrocketed. By the ’60s, the problem was becoming critical; the herds of elk were devouring young plant life before it got a chance to propagate. Several woody vegetation species became increasingly rare.

The wolves’ competitors were also seeing population booms; the coyotes, to be specific. Of course, they couldn’t prey on the elk, but they did manage to send the numbers of sheep and pronghorn antelope downhill. Pumas also staked a claim on the wolf niche, descending from the mountainsides to hunt in the grassy valleys. From an ecological point of view, wolves clearly needed to return.

After decades of debating, controversy, and in some cases even lawsuits, the government finally decided to reintroduce grey wolves to Yellowstone. In 1995, young Mackenzie Valley wolves were tranquilized and transported from Alberta to the park, where they were set free.

In the coming years, the wolves and their descendants brought the local population of elk back down to the normal level. The average wolf in Yellowstone kills about 22 elk annually; or rather, the ratio of wolves to elk killed by wolves each year is 1:22. Additionally, the behaviour of the elk changed - they came to avoid valley bottoms and thickets, where young vegetation grows, but wolves also might hide.

These two factors led to the recovery of new-growth plant life in Yellowstone. Willows, aspens and cottonwoods (trees which had previously been in critical decline) popped up all over the fringes of forests. So too did many species of berries; this, in turn, led to a resurgence in the bear population of the park.

The new wolves preying on coyotes had an even more dramatic effect than them preying on elk. The bloated coyote population fell by 50%, and the remaining ones retreated to steep hillsides where their agility and lightweight build would compensate for their lack of speed, if chased by a wolf.

The park’s red foxes, which were once dominated by the coyotes, saw a rise in numbers, as did the hares the coyotes previously hunted. The prey of foxes then saw a consequent decrease, the food of said prey saw an increase, and so on and so forth, all the way down to the microbial level.

More fascinating still is the ripples caused by beavers returning to Yellowstone. Before the wolf reintroduction, there was one beaver colony in the park; 16 years later, there were nine. Like the foxes, their population had been crippled by the coyotes.

The beavers used willow trees (which, as said, had recovered due to the elk population being checked) to make dams. The dams in turn created cool, sheltered water perfect for fish, stabilized the seasonal ebb and flow of the rivers’ runoff, and reduced erosion.

I should add the important disclaimer that not all ecologists agree on the extent of the effect that wolves have had on Yellowstone’s ecosystem. A topic of particularly heated debate is whether or not wolves affected the recovery of willows, and in turn the return of beavers.

Regardless, I think it’s safe to say that while the truth is definitely more complex than “wolves, and only wolves, fixed everything”, the reintroduction has had a very important effect on the ecosystem. But let’s now return to the subject of the question: introducing wolves to the United Kingdom.

Currently, the red deer populations of England and Scotland are slowly starting to burst at the seams. There are some 1.5 million of them in Great Britain, twice as many as there were 50 years ago. In the Scottish highlands particularly, they gnaw away at woodlands and shrublands faster than the habitats can regenerate. Additionally, they are often carriers of lyme disease.

Many call for a massive increase in culling by humans, but others still maintain that a controlled, introduced population of grey wolves, in fenced reserves, would be the perfect solution. As well as their obvious benefits for tourism, a return of the wolf could have just as dramatic an effect in Scotland as it did in Yellowstone.
