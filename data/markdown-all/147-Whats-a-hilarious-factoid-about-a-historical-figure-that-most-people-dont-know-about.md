I’m much more qualified to talk about animals and science than history, but I’ve still picked up a bunch of interesting historical facts over the years. Personally, I think that one of the most underrated historical characters is Götz von Berlichingen. He was a “warrior poet”, born in Germany in 1480, and was one of the most badass people you’ll ever hear about.

Consider the following:

*   At the age of sixteen, he joined the army of the Holy Roman Empire and became an Imperial Knight. From that point, his military career lasted an astonishing 47 years, in a time when the life expectancy was below 40.
*   A few years later, Götz left Imperial service and formed his own private company of mercenaries. In 1502, the Duke of Bavaria sent him and his mercenary army to defend the city of Landshut from a besieging army. They asked him to surrender, to which he responded : “Leck mich am Arsch.” This roughly translates to “kiss my ass” and is the first known use of the phrase.
*   During that same siege, he lost his entire right hand due to shrapnel from a cannon blast. So, he had a prosthetic iron hand engineered for him. The second version of this hand was remarkable in its mechanics; Götz could even write with a quill using it thanks to a system of springs and levers.

*   His survival and recovery from such a catastrophic injury is miraculous, but even more amazing is the fact that he continued fighting battles as a mercenary for 42 years after losing his hand! What would have spelled death for most at the time was really only the beginning for Götz von Berlichingen.
*   During this time, he got involved in a self-reported 15 personal feuds. His most famous one was that with the city of Nuremberg. In 1512, he assaulted a group of innocent Nuremberg merchants, and was subsequently declared an outlaw and banned from the Holy Roman Empire (pictured below).

*   After a few years, he paid the equivalent of 11,000 euros and was allowed back in. However, shortly thereafter, he got into a dispute with the state of Hesse and kidnapped the Count of Waldeck, demanding a huge sum of money for his safe return. Because of this, he received a second Imperial ban.
*   In 1525, he led a rebel army in the Great Peasant Revolt, fighting against the Holy Roman Empire he had once served. After the Empire suppressed the rebellion, he was put on trial but managed to be forgiven after saying he was forced to fight for the peasants. Then, in 1528, he was kidnapped by the Swabian League (who he had fought against previously) and imprisoned for 2 years.

*   The Swabians agreed to set him free as long as he stayed in his castle (which he had purchased with all the money he made as a mercenary), and he did, until 1540 when he was freed from this oath. At the age of 62, he incredibly fought against the Ottomans in Hungary, and then against the French at 64. Götz von Berlichingen was as hardcore as they get.

Finally, he decided to retire after the campaign against the French, and lived out the rest of his years in his castle with his family. He died in 1562 at the age of 82 - more than twice the average life expectancy of a European from that time. When it comes to being a badass, being an Imperial Knight turned mercenary poet with a mechanical hand is about as good as it gets.
