Probably tigers.

A 2013 survey - see [here](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/tiger-is-worlds-favourite-animal-1131562 "www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk") - asked participants what their favourite animal was. Tigers came out as number one, with 21% of those surveyed choosing it. Lions were number five, with 9% - under half of what tigers got.

Also, have a look at this pie chart which is about big cats specifically:

Unusually, cheetahs emerged as number one, but whatâ€™s relevant here is that tigers once again beat lions, by a vaguely similar ratio of ~2:1.

I myself think I prefer lions, although tigers too are amazing.
