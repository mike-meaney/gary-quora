As far as I know, chordates are the only animals which produce vocalizations, though some insects and such produce it by stridulation. So, it is logical to assume that sound production first appeared in fish, and then indepedently in a few invertebrates, mainly arthropods.

What this originated from, I canâ€™t be sure (nor can Google, it would seem) - however, given that our pharynx derives from the pharyngeal slits during ontogenesis, perhaps fish vocalizations were first made by modified gill arches.
