## Do you think that African wildlife is sugar-coated by documentaries? I have seen a shrew eating an eathworm on a tree branch.

Depends what you mean by “sugar-coat”.

If that’s what you mean, then no, no way. I’ve been to several African wildlife parks, and I can tell you, they’re every bit as exciting as the documentaries make out.

In the Maasai Mara, for example, you can see zebras, countless antelope species, buffalo, wildebeest, giraffes, hippos, crocodiles, lions, hyenas, leopards, cheetahs, ostriches, rhinos, elephants, warthogs and innumerable varieties of bird in the space of a single day’s drive.

In that case, I’ll have to say yes. Even the more brutal of documentaries don’t show uncensored footage of real kills - and they probably shouldn’t, since sensitive tourists often end up in bits after seeing a successful hunt in the wild.

Most kills, with the exception of those of leopards and cheetahs, are preceded by the animal going through inconceivable agony. A pack of hyenas, for example, may take up to 7 hours to fell an adult cape buffalo.
