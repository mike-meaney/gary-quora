\-WARNING: LONG ANSWER ALERT-

With modern technology, yes, but with primitive technology, probably not.

However, I do love me some “probably not but maybe”s, so lets have a think about the second scenario. Recent-ish discoveries have shown mammals were significantly more prominent in the Mesozoic than we thought, with evidence of them killing small dinosaurs.

With that in mind, there is a very slim chance that humans could have survived in the Age of Reptiles. I’m not sure when or where you want these humans to live, so I’ll dive in at the deep end and pick a particularly harsh one: North America, 66 million years ago.

So, we’ve got a ton of nasty dinos mucking about in this age. If I was to compare the ecosystem here to the African savanna, the tyrannosaurs would be the big cats, the ceratopsians the migratory herds of wildebeest, and the hadrosaurids the heavy browsers like rhinos and elephants. As you would expect, there would be a whole host of threats to primitive humans in this world. There was Triceratops, perhaps the most dangerous large animal ever to live, there was Pachycephalosaurus, a head-bashing herbivorous monster, and of course there was T-Rex - the most powerful natural predator known to man (And woman, of course).

But, before we get into the juicy speculative details, I just have to show this disclaimer:

DISCLAIMER: In this answer, I will pretend that humans are physiologically compatible will the levels of oxygen in the Cretaceous.

Anyway, moving on. Now, the main threats to these humans are going to be predatory dinosaurs and, perhaps less so, aggressive herbivores. Let’s focus on predators first.

The main group of large predators in North America at this time were the tyrannosaurs. Tyrannosaurus, Gorgosaurus, Albertosaurus, Daspletosaurus, all those guys. Their main advantages were size, power, and possibly pack-hunting. There were also smaller hunters like Troodon, Hesperonychus and Dromaeosaurus. Their specialties were agility, speed and pack-hunting.

Now we’ll see what humans are good at, and weigh up the strengths and weaknesses. In comparison with other animals, there are two things that humans are exceptionally good at:

*   Intelligence: We have the biggest brain size relative to body size of any animal, and have unparalleled skills in strategic thinking, problem-solving and unique capabilities like metacognition.
*   Endurance: This one might surprise you. Humans are adept at long-distance running, far better than most animals. This is because we cool down by sweating, whereas most other animals thermoregulate with panting.

Now it seems like humans actually have something reminiscent of a chance against the biggest flesh-eaters to walk the Earth. First of all, tyrannosaurs weren’t all that fast. Speed in bipeds/quadrupeds is comprised of two things: stride length and stride frequency. Stride length is determined by size, but stride frequency requires musculature and other cursorial adaptations. While tyrannosaurs could move at moderate speeds because of their massiveness, they probably couldn’t manage anything more than a fast walk. So, I believe that a human could outrun a tyrannosaur, at least with a good few metres head start and a long open space to run on.

Then when we bring intelligence into the equation, the odds shift even more towards the human (They’re still technically stacked against us, but we’ve got a chance.). Humans are exceptional about analyzing habits and weaknesses of their enemies and using them to their advantage. And even tyrannosaurs have weaknesses; Being massive, bipedal and with your body oriented horizontally means that T-Rexes are awfully top-heavy. Trip them up, and they’re dead, mate. And us smart humans would know that, and duck under fallen trees (Or something like that), while being chased by a predator. Then the T-Rex would have to turn back or fall over and die.

That shows you how humans could outsmart a tyrannosaur, but what about a lighter hunter? In North America at this time, there are dromaeosaurs, or raptors, like Troodon and Hesperonychus. They were fast, agile, and smart (For dinosaurs). Again, they were built for short sprints, not marathons, so humans could use their sweating superpowers to evade them.

With predators out of the way, the other main threat to humans in the Cretaceous is all the massive herbivores. There were about 17, possibly more, species of ceratopsian in Late Cretaceous America, and all of them had long horns, spikes and beaks (Besides being massive). There were also hadrosaurs, like the massive Edmontosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, which may have used infrasound to dazzle attackers. There would be, inevitably, a lot of human deaths attributed to these herbivores, but as long as we stayed out of their way, the majority would survive.

If primitive humans could survive in Late Cretaceous North America, a relative bloodbath even for dinosaurs, they might be able to survive anywhere, anywhen in the Mesozoic. Nevertheless, the odds would be stacked high against them.

But this leaves one last question. What would happen when the asteroid hit? Humans are really resourceful, and really hard to kill (As a species). Depending on when these humans lived in the Mesozoic, they might be extinct already, or at least have advanced technology. If the latter was true, I am confident that they could survive the Chixculub impact and the barren times that followed.

Sorry for the massive answer, but it takes a lot of speculation to answer such a thought-provoking question as that. If you want a short answer, it’d be:

With modern technology, probably. With primitive technology, maybe.
