## Why don't any big cats live in Europe? Did they live in Europe?

They certainly did. Most recently, there was the cave lion, Panthera spelaea.

Before them, there were other large felids (although not big cats as in Pantherines), one of my favourites being Machairodus aphanistus from the Miocene epoch in Spain.

But to answer your first question; why are they gone?

Well, in the case of the cave lion, it’s fairly simple. There are currently two competing hypotheses; not only are they themselves competing but they’re literally hypotheses about competition.

Essentially, it was either due to human overhunting of prey species, or competition with canids as they established themselves in Eurasia.

As for the older, saber-toothed cats, I can’t really tell since scientists rarely look into the extinction of specific genera and species. Off the top of my head, I would guess that it was cooling climate which claimed Machairodus.

It was likely a forest predator, and as the climate cools, water is sucked up into the poles and the water cycle is delayed, so things get drier. The drying of the Mediterranean region would have caused woodland to give way to grassland, thus removing Machairodus’ habitat.
