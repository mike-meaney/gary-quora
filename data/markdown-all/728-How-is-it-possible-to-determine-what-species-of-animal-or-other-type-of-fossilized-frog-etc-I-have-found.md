For a layperson? My suggestion would be to formulate a hypothesis of what you think it could be by observing the fossil - is it a vertebrate? Is it a tetrapod? How many holes are their in its skull? What are its teeth like? After that, look up an image of the skeleton (if applicable) of your suspect, and see if any bones (if applicable) match. This may take many tries without a fairly thorough knowledge of zoology.
