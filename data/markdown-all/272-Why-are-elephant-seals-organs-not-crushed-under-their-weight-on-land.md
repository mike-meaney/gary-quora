Adam is onto something. Most seals, and especially elephant seals, are highly capable deep-divers. Perhaps the most pressing (pun intended) issue of surviving at great depths is the hydrostatic pressure from all the water above you.

Let me give you an idea of the pressure that elephant seals can experience. The maximum recorded depth for them is 2.388 kilometres. We know that hydrostatic pressure = depth x density of water x acceleration due to gravity. Plug in the values and we get a result of 237 atmospheres, which would be like having a hippopotamus resting on each square inch of your body.

To ensure that their gas-filled lungs are not fatally compressed by the water, seals and other marine mammals deliberately collapse their lungs, instead storing extra oxygen in their blood and muscles, as this diagram of oxygen storage shows.

The side effect of this means that their lungs can comfortably be squashed by force without major problems - and believe me, the weight of an elephant seal is nothing compared to the pressure 2 kilometres beneath the surface.

Thanks for the A2A, hope this answers your question.
