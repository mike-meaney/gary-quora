## Is Octlantis (an octopus city near Australia) proof that if octopuses lived longer they would be able to build a complex society?

While these so-called underwater octopus cities are quite interesting to me, they are far, far from the most surprising or impressive displays of octopus intelligence. The more recently discovered “city” is known as Octlantis, as you say. Here’s a brief overview of what it is.

The site is comparable in area to an average apartment, lies around 15 metres below the surface, and is found off the coast of New South Wales. There may be as many as 15 common Sydney octopuses living there, each in their own den. The cluster of dens is centered around a jutting rocky outcrop.

And that’s all. The octopuses living there don’t (as far as we know) cooperate to hunt or construct dens, communicate, transport resources, or really interact with each other at all, beyond the likes of squabbling or play. What Octlantis, and the other “cities”, does show us is that these octopuses can tolerate the presence of other octopuses living next to them.

Interesting? Yes, certainly. But for an animal which has been seen to have incredible capacity for learning, problem-solving, dexterity, tool use, mimicry and strategy, communal living just isn’t that remarkable. Octopuses are certainly very intelligent, for molluscs at least, but Octlantis isn’t the best demonstrator of that out there.

Whether they could evolve to build complex societies is up for debate. However, as other answerers have explained, lifespan isn’t really the problem here. Octopus mothers die while brooding their eggs and the fathers have no role in parenting, so when the babies are born, they have no mentor to pass on knowledge. This, in my opinion, is the biggest factor holding back a more sophisticated octopus society.
