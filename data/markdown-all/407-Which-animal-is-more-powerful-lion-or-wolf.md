This is the largest animal known to have been killed by wolves:

One of these guys weigh, on average, an impressive 620 kilograms. Typically, about five or six healthy adults are required to take down a fully grown bison.

This is the largest animal known to have been killed by lions:

I can’t get a figure for the weight of a sub-adult African elephant, but I assure you, they’re bigger than bison. The famous “Marsh Pride”, featured in documentaries such as Savage Kingdom and Natural World, have been recorded killing healthy sub-adult male elephants.

So, we know lions hunt bigger prey, but is that just because of the two species’ local prey items? If wolves lived with elephants, would they hunt sub-adults too?

Well, the wolf’s stockier relative, the dire wolf, lived alongside beasts such as the mastodon and Columbian mammoth, the latter of which was bigger than an African elephant. However, there is no evidence for dire wolves hunting mammoths.

We do know, however, that dire wolves ate a type of animal called a ground sloth, which grew to a weight of 1,089 kilograms:

Notice that I say “ate”, not “hunted”. Analysis of bone collagen has proved that some dire wolves consumed ground sloth flesh, but they could well have scavenged a carcass. Even if they did, dire wolves were considerably more thickly muscled than gray wolves.

In terms of large apex predators today, there seems to be two ways to hunt. One way, as demonstrated by the big cats, is to sneak up on your prey and dispatch it quickly. A host of anatomical adaptations come with this specialization; long hind legs for pouncing, a short snout for crushing windpipes, retractile claws, and prehensile fore-paws for grabbing prey.

Wolves and hyenas embody the other major hunting style; long-distance chases. Because of this, they have longer forelegs for running, non-retractile claws for traction, a long, muscular neck for biting, and social habits. Lions are social too, but they evolved sociality for a different reason (See [Gary Meaney's answer to Why are lions social animals while tigers are solitary animals?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-lions-social-animals-while-tigers-are-solitary-animals/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"))

An ambush predator needs to be able to kill its prey before it can run far, while a chasing predator needs to maintain speed and stamina until it catches up. One consequence of that difference, though, is that it has effects on what the predator can and can’t kill.

Wolf prey must have poorer endurance than them, so they can actually catch it. Also, it must not fight back much when it's tired, because wolves cannot slash the victim with their claws. Most prey go into a state of shock when caught, so the wolves just bite away at it until it collapses. Elephants usually tend to run, pull and struggle.

So, to conclude: both are adapted to their respective ways of life, but the lion is probably more powerful.
