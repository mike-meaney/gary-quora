There are plenty of severely underrated giant theropods, all of them 10 metres long or longer. They might not be the very biggest carnivorous dinosaurs, but they definitely deserve more attention than they get - which is almost none. Here’s my list:

*   Bahariasaurus, quite possibly in the same size range as T. Rex, at up to 13.7 metres. It coexisted with several other enormous theropods, like Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus.

*   Deltadromeus, a contemporary of the aforementioned species. It was as long as a T. Rex, but more slender and long-legged, indicating that it could run at very high speeds.

*   Siats, a 4-ton, 12 metre beast. One of North America’s largest ever theropods, this genus coexisted with early tyrannosaurs (which were only little at the time) in Utah, 100 million years ago.

*   Oxalaia, a slightly smaller relative of the much more famous Spinosaurus. Known from Brazil, this spinosaur has an estimated length of 12–14 metres and could have weighed up to 7,000 kilograms.

*   Sauroniops, a Moroccan carcharodontosaur. Its length has been suggested to be as much as 12 metres, but coolest of all its name means “Eye of Sauron”, a reference to The Lord of the Rings.

*   Tyrannotitan, one of the heaviest theropods of all. With a heavy skull and a long, powerful tail (possibly an adaptation for swimming), this Argentinian dinosaur was at least 12.2 metres long and potentially 7 tons in weight.

*   Chilantaisaurus, measuring 11–13 metres long. Not only was it huge, but it had unusually large claws, leading some to believe it was a primitive member of the spinosaurid family.

*   Torvosaurus, perhaps Europe’s largest ever carnivore. Originally thought to be 12 metres long, it was downsized to a still impressive 10. We’ve actually found fossils Torvosaurus embryos, still in their eggs.

*   The largest abelisaur of all times, an unnamed Kenyan predator evidently as long as T. Rex, and by some calculations, possibly heavier. Nicknamed “Titanovenator” on the Internet, it coexisted with a host of other mammoth theropods in Cretaceous North Africa.

*   Sinotyrannus. At up to 10 metres long, this dinosaur was one of the first truly huge tyrannosauroids, hailing from China of the Early Cretaceous. Evidently, the tyrannosaur group evolved large size twice, contrary to previous ideas.

*   Another unnamed species, this one a megalosaurid from Spain. It was relative of Torvosaurus, and apparently only slightly smaller than the likes of Tyrannosaurus rex and the largest carcharodontosaurs.

*   Osteoporosia - only known from fragmentary remains, this possible megaraptoran is poorly understood. However, we do know that it was big - possibly even a staggering 15 metres long.

An honorable mention - the maker of [these tracks](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228465395_Rastrilladas_de_icnitas_teropodas_gigantes_del_Jurasico_Superior_Sinclinal_de_Iouaridene_Marruecos "www.researchgate.net"). The footprints, which came from the Late Jurassic of Morocco, are allegedly “the largest discovered yet in the world”, at over 80 centimetres long in some cases. Tyrannosaurus tracks, on the other hand, are usually around 47.

Note that plenty of the above dinosaurs are poorly understood, hence their obscurity. Hence, in the future they might be downsized when better remains are found.
