Warning: some graphic imagery

I had a draft for this lying around, and by the time I returned to it, it turned out Clayton had also picked hyenas. Oh well, at least mine’s a different format. So, I nominate spotted hyenas, one of the most metal animals in the world.

Consider the following facts:

*   Spotted hyenas have an astonishingly powerful bite, which has been measured at around 1,000 pounds per square inch. Among mammals, only the hippo and jaguar outperform it.

*   In 2011, a couple of hyenas in a Johannesburg zoo chewed through iron bars in order to escape their enclosure. According to the keepers, this is a regular occurrence.
*   Lions usually leave a lot of their prey’s carcass untouched once they’re done. Not so for spotted hyenas - if they have enough time (news of free food gets round fast in the savanna), a pack of hyenas would completely demolish a kill, bones, hooves, hair and all.

*   They eat so much bone that the calcium makes their feces bright white, making them easy to spot. You’ll also regularly see whole hooves, undigested, in spotted hyena dung.

*   Despite being reviled as scavengers, spotted hyenas are chiefly predaceous. Overall, they get - on average - 70% of food from hunting and 30% from scavenging.

*   A clan in the Ngorongoro Crater, according to Hans Kruuk, derived at least 98% of their food from honest hunting. In the Crater, hyenas have thoroughly outcompeted lions as top predator.
*   When they do scavenge, they can do so spectacularly. In numbers, they’re able to drive cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs, even lion prides off their kills.

*   Because they’re in such hot competition with lions, spotted hyenas are nature’s ultimate fast eaters. A single one could finish a gazelle fawn in two minutes, and a group could demolish a large zebra carcass in half an hour.
*   Some hyenas have even been observed swallowing Cape buffalo ribs whole, all in one gulp. For comparison, a buffalo rib is over a meter long.
*   Spotted hyenas are bigger than a lot of people think. At their absolute smallest, adults are 40 kg, but a lot of large females can weigh in at 90 kilograms. Members of extinct populations could have reached 100 kg.

*   They live in matriarchal groups called clans, which can sometimes be huge. In Ngorongoro, there was, I believe, a clan recorded which had over 100 members, potentially dozens of which could be hunting a single prey item at one time.

*   They are highly intelligent creatures, regarded by none other than world-famous primatologist Jane Goodall as being as intelligent as primates. Their frontal lobe is proportionately bigger than a chimpanzee’s.
*   Experiments have shown that hyenas outrank chimps in their cooperative abilities.

*   Spotted hyenas are capable of bringing down huge prey items, including Cape buffaloes, giraffes, white rhinos, hippos and even African elephants.

*   Hans Kruuk documented clans in the Serengeti killing fully-grown bull Cape buffalo, one of the most dangerous mammals in the world. Such a kill would be a Herculean effort even for a pride of lions.
*   Hyenas occasionally do attack humans, but when they do, they can be devastating. One five year-old who was attacked lost his ear and lower jaw, and had a chunk taken out of his head. He survived, thankfully.

*   It’s true that a single hyena would be beaten in a fight by a lion, but this is mainly due to the size difference. A female hyena weighs about as much as a leopard, and usually beat leopards in scraps, so if scaled up to lion size they could likely do the same.

*   Hyenas can barely feel pain, apparently. From Hans Kruuk’s The Spotted Hyena: A Guide to Predation and Social Behaviour: “Hyenas . . . have a very tough skin and are almost impervious to pain”.
*   Hyena prey items, on the other hand, feel a lot of pain. Lacking sharp claws or prehensile wrists like cats, spotted hyenas are unable to dispatch victims quickly and instead have their meat… on the hoof.

*   The females have to give birth through, basically, the equivalent of a drinking straw. Their bizarre genitalia almost always tear and bleed during birth. But they don’t care, because they’re hardcore hyenas.
*   Spotted hyenas are very good at feeding underwater and sometimes dive for extended periods of time to eat kills which they brought down in deep water holes.

*   They are immune to rabies and even anthrax! Studies have shown that clans often sail right through viral epidemics which destroy other local carnivore populations.
*   In Nigeria, there are allegedly spotted hyenas used by gangs as extra muscle to assist in bank robberies. There are also of course the famous “hyena men”, pictured.

*   Hans Kruuk observed a few hyenas kill 82 gazelles in one night, also fatally injuring 27. The hyenas only ate about a dozen. This is, as far as I know, the most extreme example of surplus killing ever documented.

* * *

I don’t think anybody could say that hyenas aren’t badass after reading that. I . apologize if any of the images were upsetting. For clarification; it may seem like I’m portraying hyenas as like movie monsters, ruthless and powerful killers who will stop at nothing to destroy their victims.

I hate it when films do that, and that’s not how I mean to portray them. However, you did ask for the hardcore aspects of my chosen animal. Just remember that hyenas also have a fascinating social hierarchy, are caring towards their young, and are often playful and curious. Here’s a cute scene to cancel out the tooth and claw above:

Anyway, thanks for reading.
