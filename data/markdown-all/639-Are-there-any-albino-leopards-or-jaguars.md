As far as I know, albinism occurs in all big cats.

There’s also a colour morph in both leopards and jaguars called “white panther”. It’s not specifically albinism, but it makes them cream-to-white with blue eyes. Also, in a 1993 document, 11 albino leopards were documented in India.

I’m not sure, but I wouldn’t be surprised if leopards and jaguars can be leucistic as well, which occurs in lions and cougars.
