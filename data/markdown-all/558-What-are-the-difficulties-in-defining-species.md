A species is generally defined as a group of organisms that reproduce with one another in nature. Sounds simple enough, right? Unfortunately, nature is too complicated to adhere to definitions like this. Take the following examples:

Countless organisms - bacteria, archaea, single-celled eukaryotes, many plants and fungi, even some animals - reproduce asexually. Therefore, they obviously don’t reproduce with any other organisms. It would be ridiculous to classify every individual asexual specimen as its own species, so instead, we have to go on arbitrarily decided physical characteristics and such.

In 1981, scientists introduced a medium ground finch to one of the Galápagos islands, where it interbred with a native Española cactus finch. After two generations of the hybrids resulting therein, a bird was produced with slightly different proportions and a different mating call.

Since the hybrids were attracted only to this mating call and wouldn’t reproduce with the “pure” birds, they were classified as a new species - despite the physical traits alone being insufficient to merit this. Is it really fair to call them two separate species just because of a different song?

In a similar vein, just look at humans. Ethnic feuds abound in every inhabited corner of the globe, and it’s not that unusual for two tribes - or, nationalities, religions, take your pick - to never reproduce with one another, due to conflict or taboo. Obviously you’d never call those two tribes different species, however.

As a final example, consider my good friends; dogs. Outwardly, dogs look incredibly diverse, but genetically, they’re very similar. Therefore, we classify them all in the same subspecies; Canis lupus familiaris.

However, due to… mechanical complications, a Chihuahua and a Malamute cannot naturally breed. So are they different species? According to the definition at the start, yes, but they’re never considered as such by scientists.

So, how can we get rid of all these loopholes and inconsistencies? Well, we would do away with the concept of “species” altogether, because in nature, “species” don’t exist.

But that’s not going to happen, of course. Partially because the urge to classify, organize and compartmentalize is simply human nature. But also because we’re probably better off with the concept than without.

Dividing up the world’s organisms into species, while somewhat arbitrary, is extremely useful for those who study these organisms. At the end of the day, perhaps we just have to sacrifice a bit of empirical correctness for the sake of convenience.
