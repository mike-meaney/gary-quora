The Alagoas foliage-gleaner of Brazil hasn’t been seen in nearly eight years, so in 2018 researchers recommended that it be officially pronounced extinct. It’s a member of the bird family known as ovenbirds, which are so named because they build elaborate clay nests.

Even worse, the Alagoas foliage-gleaner is quite possibly two species - the other being the cryptic treehunter, which hasn’t been seen since 2007. In the same 2018 study, it was suggested that it be classified as extinct too. It was only discovered to be a unique species in 2014, meaning we knew about it for - at best - a few years, before its extinction.

Two years prior, in 2015, the Bramble Cay melomys died out. This small rodent was endemic to Bramble Cay, a small (0.0362 square kilometre) sandy island which pokes up out of the Great Barrier Reef, and is Australia’s northernmost land. As it went extinct due to sea level rise, this melomys is the first mammal to go extinct due to man-made climate change.

The most recently extinct reptile is the Pinta Island tortoise. In 2012, the last of this species - the famous Lonesome George - passed away due to cardiac arrest, likely over 100 years old at the time. That might seem ancient to us, but for a giant tortoise to die so early is actually quite unusual.

In 2010, another bird was declared extinct - the Alaotra grebe, a small waterbird which lived only in Alaotra Lake, Madagascar. It hasn’t been seen since 1985, and there’s only one known photograph of it (which is very blurry, an artist’s reconstruction is below).

Another Australian mammal which was recently disappeared is the Christmas Island pipistrelle, an insectivorous bat which has been extinct since 2009\. Despite being abundant on Christmas Island in the 20th century, intensive efforts to find it since ’09 have failed, and the pipistrelle became the first extinct Australian mammal in half a century.

Perhaps the most recently extinct large animal is the Saudi gazelle, which the IUCN declared extinct in 2008. Its story is a sad one, because it was long considered to just be a subspecies of the dorcas gazelle, and as a result, received very little attention from conservationists. A closely related species is shown below.

With the last known individuals dying in 2004, the po’o-uli is most likely extinct, although the IUCN is yet to officially classify it as such. The po’o-uli was found only on the island of Maui, in Hawaii, and was the last member of the diverse lineage of birds known as the Hawaiian honeycreepers to be discovered.

And that’s been my depressing answer on the species which have gone extinct in the last 20 years. This doesn’t include the several subspecies which have died out in that time, such as the Pyrenean ibex and West African black rhino, and there are more species which are likely to go extinct in the next few years without drastic action.
