Well, in general, a young seal is called a pup. This is the same in sea lions, fur seals, but not walruses (Their young are calves.).

I don’t know that much about seal juvenile development, except for a fairly thorough knowledge of harp seal growth. So, all the information below applies only to harp seals (Unless stated otherwise.).

A newborn harp sea or grey seal is called a whitecoat, for its white coloration. Newborn hooded seals are called bluebacks.

12–14 days after birth, seals (If applicable), begin to shed their white coats, at which point they are known as “ragged-jackets”.

After molting their white coats, they enter the greycoat stage. During this time, their blubber builds up and they get quite fat on their mother’s milk, gaining up to 36 kg in weight.

Then, they are abruptly weaned (abandoned) by their mothers. They’re now called “weaners” (Yes, weaners.), and are too immobilely fat to follow their mothers.

They then soon enter the “beater” stage. They learn to swim at this point, and the noise their tails make when doing so gives them their name. Without their mothers, they struggle to find food, and may lose up to 50% of their weight.

When about a year old, the pups molt again, and become “bedlamers”. For several years, their “harp” will develop, at first spotted and broken, but eventually full.

After a few moltings in the bedlamer stage, there isn’t really any term to describe a seal pup’s specific stage of childhood. After 6 years, they becoming adults, and may live up to 30 years.
