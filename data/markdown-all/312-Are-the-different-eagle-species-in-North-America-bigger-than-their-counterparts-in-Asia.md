No. Eagles are mainly an Old World group, probably having only recently colonized the Americas, and as such, they’re much more diverse in Africa and Asia than in the New World. When you look at the biogeography of the giant eagle species, it’s clear that much more are located in Afro-Eurasia.

On average, the largest eagle species by length is the Philippine Eagle, which is native only to the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao in the Philippines. At an average of 1 metre long for females, they weigh up to 8 kilograms and can have a wingspan of 2.2 metres. I think Douglas Adams describes this magnificent bird best:

> A wildly improbable-looking piece of flying hardware that you would more readily expect to see coming to land on an aircraft than perched in a tree.

They usually eat monkeys, bats, colugos, and sometimes even 14-kg deer.

Equally majestic is the Steller’s sea eagle, the largest eagle in terms of weight, at least in the wild. To be found on the North Pacific coast of Asia, it was named after the famous naturalist Georg Willhelm Steller, who discovered many species in the Bering region. Steller’s sea eagles can weigh up to 9.5 kilograms in females, making them the heaviest wild raptors in the world.

Technically, vagrants (individuals which accidentally find themselves well outside their natural range) have been found in North America, but I don’t think this counts as it’s a fluke of nature.

A bird often cited as the largest eagle is the harpy eagle, and indeed captive females have been known to weigh up to 12 kilograms. That being said, Steller’s sea eagles usually outsize them in the wild. This is the first point to the New World, as harpy eagles are found in the forests of neotropics - including the southern part of North America.

Like the Philippine eagle, harpy eagles eat a lot of primates, as well as sloths. They’re not quite at the top of the food chain, as jaguars and ocelots can prey on them.

The white-tailed eagle is the world’s fourth-largest species, and the largest one in Europe. Mainly found in Russia and Northern Europe, but also in other parts of Asia, it is once again an Old World bird. Vagrants in Alaska have also been recorded, but as said I don’t think they count.

It’s one of the best-studied species of eagle, and as such enjoys a [gargantuan Wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-tailed_eagle "en.wikipedia.org")

Moving on to fifth place, we come to a personal favourite of mine, the martial eagle. While it’s native to Africa, and not Asia as your question specifies, it does advance my point that the Old World has much more giant eagles than the New. Africa’s largest raptor, they have perhaps the most diverse diet of any carnivore (over 150 species) and have been known to kill 37 kg antelope nearly six times their size.

I’ve had the privilege of seeing martial eagles in the wild in Kenya - in fact, I took the above photograph myself in the Samburu National Reserve. It seemed to be considering attacking some nearby guineafowl but never made up its mind, unfortunately.

Now we come to the wedge-tailed eagle, Australia’s largest eagle. While Oceania doesn’t fit into the Old World / New World dichotomy (at least in biogeography), there is a population of wedge-tails in the far eastern corner of the Indonesian side of New Guinea, so they qualify as Asian too. They have a larger wingspan than any other eagle, at an impressive 2.84 metres.

Wedge-tailed eagles have been known to hunt even larger prey than the aforementioned martial eagle, such as a kangaroo which weighed 50 kilograms. Considering they only weigh 3–5.8 kg, that’s very impressive.

Barely smaller than the wedge-tailed eagle is the golden eagle, one of the world’s most widespread eagles. Since it’s found in both Afro-Eurasia and North America, I guess this one gives a point to both? Then again, the largest golden eagles - Aquila chrysaetos daphaena \- are native to the Himalayas, which are of course part of Asia.

Golden eagles definitely qualify as the most powerful predatory birds of all. One was even seen killing a young cow which weighed a staggering 114 kilograms! Of course, it was too heavy to fly away with, but it’s still an unbelievable feat on the part of the eagle.

So, after this tour, we’ve found that the Old World boasts six giant eagle species, of which one - the martial eagle - isn’t found in Asia. If you include the golden eagle, North America (and by extension the New World) has two.

What if we include extinct giant eagles? Well, there’s the Haast’s eagle of New Zealand, which isn’t Old or New World, the Malagasy crowned eagle of Madagascar, the Woodward’s eagle of the Caribbean, and that’s about all I can think of at the moment.

So, our final scores are 7 for the Old World, 4 for the New, and 2 for Oceania.
