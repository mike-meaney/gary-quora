As far as I know, no. There are (quite a few) cases of cannibalism in spotted hyenas, and even infanticide, however, these are either already dead or from rival clans.

In fact, female spotted hyenas are very protective of their cubs:

> Females with cubs keep everybody away from them with aggressive postures and sounds

That’s from Kruuk, 1972, The Spotted Hyena

However, if a cub was to die from starvation, disease, a lion attack, etc., I would not be surprised if there instances in which mothers would feed on it. However, infants would certainly not be purposely killed for food.

I can’t speak for the other hyena species, since they’re very poorly studied. Still I doubt that anything of the sort occurs in them either.
