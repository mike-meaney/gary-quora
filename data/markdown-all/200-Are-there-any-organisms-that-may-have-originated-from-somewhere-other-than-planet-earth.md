The closest thing to that we have is one hypothesis - which sounds pretty cool, but perhaps not the most rational - on the cause of the Cambrian Explosion. In case any of you don’t know, the Cambrian Explosion was a period, about 541 million years ago, when most modern animal phyla appeared.

There are many proposed explanations for the Cambrian Explosion, and perhaps the most radical one I’ve heard was put forward in this 2018 paper - [Cause of Cambrian Explosion - Terrestrial or Cosmic?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079610718300798 "www.sciencedirect.com"). The authors’ reasoning was this:

Discoveries a year earlier (see [Origin of the retroviruses: when, where, and how?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187962571730041X "www.sciencedirect.com")) demonstrated that retroviruses - RNA viruses with vertebrate hosts - originated just before the Cambrian Explosion, at about 550 mya.

They proposed that these viruses were in fact extraterrestrial, having been brought to Earth via panspermia, and introduced entirely new genes to life. Animals are able to co-opt retroviral genes into their own genomes - about 5–8% of the human genome came from viruses, and these new genes could have caused this sudden burst in diversity and new features.

Personally, I feel that there is insufficient evidence to support this frankly extraordinary claim, and many scientists agree with me. However, it is, at least, the view of some biologists that extraterrestrials live on in our genomes.
