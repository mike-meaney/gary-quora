## A very long time ago, a type of spotted hyena was seen in Europe. As Europe is wolf country, which of the two species would have been more dominant?

I imagine that they were in fairly hot competition. Both occupied the niche of social pursuit predators, hunting large megafauna. In fact, there was an extinct eco-morph of wolf which was found in Europe, the megafaunal wolf, which was adapted for bone-crushing, just like hyenas.

In fact, many wolf bones have been unearthed in what are thought to be the dens of cave hyenas. Wikipedia says:

> The cave hyena likely killed wolves due to intraguild competition

Intraguild predation is when a predator kills another species of predator which it competes with. Interesting that they “know” the other species depends on the same resource as them.

However, many paleoartists love to speculate. One such artist - Hodari Nundu, who rarely fails to impress - has imagined cave hyenas as cooperating with Pleistocene wolf packs;

This is actually fairly plausible. In Israel’s Negev Desert, striped hyenas are known to walk amongst wolves, lending their superior sense of smell in return for a better chance of food. For more information on this bizarre case, see [Gary Meaney's answer to Do wolves and hyenas depend on each other?](https://www.quora.com/Do-wolves-and-hyenas-depend-on-each-other/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com").

However, this is just a casual speculation on the part of the artist, and not intended to be taken as fact. What seems true is that, at least in most cases, cave hyenas and wolves were not friends.
