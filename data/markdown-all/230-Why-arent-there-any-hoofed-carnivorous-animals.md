## Why aren't there any hoofed carnivorous animals?

There were…

Only they’ve gone extinct now.

Pictured above are Andrewsarchus, Mesonyx, Harpagolestes, Daeodon, Archaeotherium and Pachyaena. Andrewsarchus’ classification is mysterious, but Daeodon and Archaeotherium were entelodonts and the rest mesonychids.

Entelodonts were pig-like carnivores, closely allied to whales and hippos, which sometimes grew to huge sizes - as in the terrifying Daeodon shoshonensis. They were primarily woodland predators and went extinct due to the replacement of forests with more open, grasslandy habitats.

Mesonychids resembled carnivorans in many respects but had hooves. Their extinction was likely caused by competition with huge creodonts like Hyaenodon and Sarkastodon (one of my favourite prehistoric mammals).

There were other hoofed predators not shown in the illustration, too. Some early ancestors of today’s whales ate fish, but had hoofed feet; an example of one of these hoofed cetaceans is Indohyus.

There is even an extinct species of pig (a true pig, not an entelodont) which seems to show adaptations for high carnivory, even bone-crushing - Tetraconodon. However, it’s still an obscure and little-studied species so I wouldn’t bank on it yet.

TL;DR: There have been several occurrences of hoofed animals going carnivorous in prehistory, it’s just that all the lineages have gone extinct. As to why they’re gone, it’s not to do with their hoofedness but rather for miscellaneous unrelated reasons.
