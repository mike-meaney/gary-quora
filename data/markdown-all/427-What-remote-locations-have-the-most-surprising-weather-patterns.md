In the extreme northwest of Venezuela, there can be found an expansive tidal bay known as Lake Maracaibo. At one point, it was a true lake - cut off from the sea - and if it was still this way it would be the largest and oldest lake in South America. However, it’s since become connected to the Caribbean by a narrow strait.

Three sides of the inlet are bounded by the Perijá and Mérida mountain chains, both branches of the Andes. When the trade winds blow warm, moisture-laden air from the Caribbean Sea towards the lake, it mingles with the cold, dry air descending from these mountains. This in turn creates electrical charges, and the result is spectacular - near-constant thunderstorms.

Over the boggy wetlands where the Catatumbo river spills into Maracaibo, this phenomenon, known as Catatumbo lightning, arises. For around 150 nights of the wet season, for 10 hours on each of those nights, lightning continuously strikes - up to nearly 5 times a second!

Such is the lasting brightness of Catatumbo lightning that it has historically been used as a “lighthouse” by passing ships. As the anthem of Zulia, a state of Venezuela, says:

> The light with that lightning  
> Is tenacious Catatumbo,  
> Sets the route of the navigator,  
> What limpid headlight;  
> The dawning of the tropics.  
> The bonfire that dazzles  
> When the zenith it soars  
> The chariot of the sun...  
> No emulate of your glories  
> The refulgent blush.

Here are some more awe-inspiring pictures of the storms.

I should also add that there are plenty of other interesting things about Maracaibo. It has huge reserves of crude oil, the extraction of which has unfortunately led to some horrendous pollution (pictured). It suffers from an infestation of a water plant called duckweed, which fills around 130 billion litres of the lake’s volume. Some villages on its shores have the world’s highest incidence of the brutal Huntington’s disease.

In retrospect, I’ve described it as a polluted, weed-choked, disease-ridden place of perpetual storms. I’m sure there are plenty of more positive aspects to the bay too. Anyway, let’s get back on topic.

With around 1.2 million lightning strikes every year, Lake Maracaibo is by far the most lightning-struck place on Earth. As you would expect, the same factors which were discussed in the second paragraph give rise to somewhat less extreme examples elsewhere. Here’s a world map of lightning strike frequency:

The most noticeable gold patch is in the eastern reaches of the DR Congo, in Central Africa. Again, we’ve got moisture-laden winds blowing in from a warm sea (in this case the Gulf of Guinea) meeting with cold, dry winds coming down from mountains (in this case the Albertine Rift Valley). The same goes for the Kashmir region with the Arabian Sea and the Karakoram mountains.

While these places are impressively electric, Lake Maracaibo is still the reigning champion as the most, uh, lightningsome location on Earth.
