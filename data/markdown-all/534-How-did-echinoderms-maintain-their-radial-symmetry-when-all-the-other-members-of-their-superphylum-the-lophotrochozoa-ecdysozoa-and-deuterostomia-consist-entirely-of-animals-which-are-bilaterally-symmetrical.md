## How did echinoderms maintain their radial symmetry when all the other members of their superphylum, the lophotrochozoa, ecdysozoa, and deuterostomia, consist entirely of animals which are bilaterally symmetrical?

They didn’t; Echinoderms re-evolved radial symmetry after losing it. If we look at echinoderm embryos as they develop, we find they are originally bilaterally symmetric, and then turn radial.

The field of evo-devo, or evolutionary developmental biology, tells us that this indicates bilateral ancestors. Additionally, if you look at the fossil record, here are some early echinoderms:

You’ll find that they’re mainly bilateral, with some exceptions like Gogia there in the top right. Genetic studies - such as [this one](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gj.1018 "onlinelibrary.wiley.com") - indicate that the first echinoderm was bilaterally symmetric, with gills and a water-vascular system. The study I linked says that this creature would have looked much like a Homalozoan:

Homalozoans were bizarre extinct invertebrates, and their classification has long been mysterious. That paper was onto something, though - just a few months ago, they were confirmed to be unequivocally related to echinoderms - [Scientists Finally Solved a Mystery About What This Bizarre 480-Million-Year-Old Creature Is](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a26469816/stylophoran-weird-ancient-animal/ "www.popularmechanics.com").

So, that is how embryology, paleontology and genetics point towards echinoderms having evolved from bilaterally symmetric organisms, regaining radial symmetry.
