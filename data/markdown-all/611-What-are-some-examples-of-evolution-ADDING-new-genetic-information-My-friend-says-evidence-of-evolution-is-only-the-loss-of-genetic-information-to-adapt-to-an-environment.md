## What are some examples of evolution ADDING new genetic information? My friend says evidence of evolution is only the loss of genetic information to adapt to an environment.

That’s a blatant lie. How would that even work? How would one adapt to the environment if what’s left from the loss was already there in the first place? A ridiculous claim.

“You can’t add information” seems to be the battle cry of most modern “creation scientists”, as they call themselves - oxymoronically. This is just untrue, and demonstrably so. Creationists leave the definition of information undefined, impossibly vague and constantly shifting.

No matter how you define information, we’ve seen mutations add it to the genome. We have directly observed:

*   Genetic variety in a population increasing
*   Genetic material in a genome increasing
*   Novel genetic material appearing
*   Novel abilities regulated by genes appearing

Any other meaning of information would have nothing to do with evolution. Here - [Evolution of new information](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Evolution_of_new_information#List_of_studies_showing_increased_genetic_information "rationalwiki.org") - you can find an exhaustive list of studies proving that new genetic information can and does appear.
