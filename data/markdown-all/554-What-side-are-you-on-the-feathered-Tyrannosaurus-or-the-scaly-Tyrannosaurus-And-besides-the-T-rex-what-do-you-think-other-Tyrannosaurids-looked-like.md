## What side are you on, the feathered Tyrannosaurus or the scaly Tyrannosaurus? And besides the T. rex, what do you think other Tyrannosaurids looked like?

I think that it’s quite plausible that Tyrannosaurus had scales all over, but a dorsal mane of feathers running from the base of the head to where the tail begins, like this:

The theropods pictured are actually Lythronax argestes (which is actually really cool, one of my favorite dinosaur species), but you get the idea.

I think this because:

*   It is consistent with what scaly skin impressions we currently have
*   The majority of an animal’s heat is lost through the dorsum
*   It would look really fricking cool
