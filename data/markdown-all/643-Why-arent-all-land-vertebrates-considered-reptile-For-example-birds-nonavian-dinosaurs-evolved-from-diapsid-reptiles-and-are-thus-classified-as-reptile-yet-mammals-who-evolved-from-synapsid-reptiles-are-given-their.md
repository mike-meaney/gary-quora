## Why aren't all land vertebrates considered reptile? For example: birds (nonavian dinosaurs) evolved from diapsid reptiles and are thus classified as reptile, yet mammals, who evolved from synapsid reptiles, are given their own class: mammalia. Why?

The term “mammal-like reptiles” is no longer valid. As we currently understand it, the common ancestor of synapsids and living reptiles was not a reptile - just a basal amniote.

Birds, however, are reptiles, yes. Also, you’re forgetting amphibians which are neither reptile nor mammal nor bird but are, of course, land vertebrates.
