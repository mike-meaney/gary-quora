There are two ways to be successful in the natural world.

1.  You can be the under-dog and live for dozens of millions of years
2.  You can dominate the planet, then die out when things change.

For example, almost every large terrestrial predator niche in the world is occupied by a member of the order Carnivora. That means cats, dogs, seals, bears, hyenas and their relatives. Similarly, virtually all large terrestrial herbivore niches are occupied by ungulates - hoofed animals. You might think that they’re the truly successful animals - for example, I’ve never seen a protist being the apex predator in an ecosystem. And in some ways, these animals are successful - for now.

But the average ungulate genus only lasts about 8 million years. For carnivores, it’s even shorter, at 6 million years. Yet, the cyanobacteria we see today are virtually identical to those from 2.8 billion years ago.

To put that into a more tangible perspective, if we condensed years into seconds, a carnivore genus would last 72 days. On the other hand, the lifespan of the cyanobacteria would be 95 years. Therefore, a genus of cyanobacteria lasts about 31,500,000,000 times longer than a healthy individual human.

But how are they so survivable? Well, bacteria don’t need much to survive. Nutrients, warmth, and… that’s about it. Many don’t even need oxygen. On the other hand, a cheetah needs a good supply of large game, wide open plains, a tropical climate, prey that’s too fast for other predators, and lot’s more.

So, the truth is, that becoming advanced is about becoming suited to your environment. But nature is in constant flux, and environments never stay the same for long. Therefore, the more primitive life-forms are the hardier ones.

Fun fact - it’s thought that if all living organisms on Earth were wiped out - animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, you name it - life would still have a fair chance. Microorganisms on space stations are durable enough to survive the satellites’ eventual reentry, thus transporting organisms to a still-habitable Earth.
