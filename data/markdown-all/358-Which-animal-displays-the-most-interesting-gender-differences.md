Rhizocephalans win, hands down. I’m not even joking - there literally could not be sexual dimorphism more extreme than this.

So, Rhizocephala is an order of Cirripedes (barnacles), and all of the clade’s members are parasitic. This is the female

(Yes that’s actually a barnacle)

The bulbous sac at the top is called the “externa”, while the network of root-like threads is called the “interna”. What is it internal do?” I hear you ask. Well, the roots grow inside the body of a crustacean, usually centering around the digestive system, while the externa grows where the crab’s reproductive organs once were (Which have been eaten by the barnacle, naturally - it’s called “parasitic castration”).

Now, these females themselves aren’t exactly highly complex organisms. They have no appendages or segmentation (Two of the defining features of arthropods), and no internal organs except their gonads, a few muscles and the remains of a nervous system.

What does the male look like? Once he’s passed his larval form, which also refuses to be normal (Since they have no mouths or guts), he attaches himself to the female’s externa, injects his internal cell mass, until he is nothing but a few of these:

Spermatogenic cells. Each one measures only a few picometres in diameter, and swims freely of the rest. The cells fertilize the female’s eggs inside the externa, and fertilizes her eggs. The mature externa drops off its crustacean host, and the newborn barnacles swim out.

TL;DR: The female is a bulbous bladder attached to the ex-gonads of a crab, and has no appendages, segmentation, and barely any organ systems. The male is… a bunch of cells.
