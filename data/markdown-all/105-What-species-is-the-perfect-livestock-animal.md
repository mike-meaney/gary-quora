Surprisingly enough, you could definitely make a case for oysters as the winners of that title. They’re hardly the first thing that comes to mind when you think of livestock, but - as they are animals which are farmed to produce commodities - they do qualify.

Oyster farming is a practice which has been ongoing since ancient Roman times, as their shells, meat and pearls are all valuable goods. But what makes them so special? Well, they’re about as space- and resource-efficient as one could possibly hope for an animal to be.

They can be raised in vertical “gardens” suspended from the ocean surface, with potential for hundreds of tiers. Because of this, one could keep a thousand oysters in a space whose footprint would fit inside a hula hoop. Now imagine a whole underwater forest of these stacks.

Furthermore, they’re about as low-maintenance as animals get. Obviously, you don’t have to provide drinking water for them - they’re immersed in it - and you don’t even have to feed them. Oysters are filter feeders, so they simply sift through the water for plankton. Because of this, they can actually be used to clean up dirty water:

So, not only are they incredibly space-efficient and require no provided food or water, but they can actually benefit the ecosystem of the environment they’re farmed in. Right now, our inefficient agriculture is a massive contributor to climate change and biodiversity loss, so farming like this is more important than ever.

Of course, I’m not suggesting we replace all cattle-rearing and such with oyster farming. I doubt you’ll be having a bivalve burger any time soon. However, it can’t be denied that when it comes to efficiency, very few farmed animals can compare to oysters and their relatives.
