## How quickly do giant icebergs move through the water when in the North Atlantic? How much sooner or later would the Titanic needed to have been at that spot, to avoid the collision, without changing course or speed?

This is totally not my area of expertise, but I saw this question so I might as well answer it.

So, the Titanic sank here:

Which would evidently put it in the Gulf Stream when it sank:

This map of the Stream’s speed suggests it flows about .5 a second at the spot where the Titanic went down:

The iceberg was estimated to be 60–120 metres in length. Let’s go with the upper estimate just to make sure. Therefore, it would take 240 seconds - better known as 4 minutes - for the iceberg to have completely shifted to a different spot.

If it was 60 metres long, it would have taken 2 minutes. So, there’s your answer: 2–4 minutes.
