## Hypothetically is it possible to have two same (or similar) organisms (in looks and function) but with completely different DNAs?

As Frank has pointed out, all organisms on Earth have DNA in common and thus lack completely different genomes. However, it is wholly common for organisms to evolve very similar outward appearances independently.

This is, as Claire said, called convergent evolution. The most famous examples are marsupials vs. placentates and aquatic vertebrate streamlining, but I think the starkest occurrences are those similarities between Australasian and mainland birds and reptiles.

This is an emu:

This is a rhea:

Yes, they’re both ratites, but given that all Paleognath lineages developed flightlessness independently, these appearances were developed independently of each other.

Here’s a few more comparisons between Australian and non-Australian birds:

Brush-turkey vs. wild turkey:

I could go on, but I should probably stop now. Hopefully this answer’s been helpful.
