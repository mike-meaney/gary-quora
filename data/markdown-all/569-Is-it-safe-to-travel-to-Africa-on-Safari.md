In general, no. The larger wildlife poses virtually no danger, provided you have a knowledgeable driver. Elephants, rhino and buffalo do sometimes charge vehicles, but a guide should know how to recognize the signs and leave before that happens.

It’s the small animals which are more of a threat - namely mosquitoes. However, there are plenty of countermeasures which minimize the risk of contracting malaria - mosquito nets, anti-malarial pills and repellent scented wristbands, for example.

Danger from people is, of course, something to keep in mind in many African countries. If you’re in cities like Nairobi, it is advisable to stay out of various dangerous areas, especially poorer districts. There are countries in Africa which are war-torn, of course, but they’re not safari destinations anyway.

Most reserves and parks are safe, although a few, such as [Samburu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samburu_National_Reserve "en.wikipedia.org"), pictured, are the sites of ethnic conflicts. Lodges there have a curfew where you have to be back in by 6:30 in the evening.

Overall, though, once you’re careful the risk of running into danger is low. Millions and millions of people go on safari in East and Southern Africa yearly, and the vast majority of them are perfectly safe throughout their trips.
