## How does evolution explain how something can go from not flying to flying, and other examples like this where it seems there is no mid-point, it either can or can't?

The origin of insect flight is currently mysterious as bugs often don’t preserve well due to their fragility. However, we have plausible hypotheses.

Perhaps the most detailed is the paranotal hypothesis. Many early insect fossils have these lateral flaps, very wing-like in structure, which were probably used to “parachute” from heights, in the same manner that a page falls slower flat than scrunched up.

These lobes, according to the hypothesis, would’ve been rigged up with some musculature, allowing the early insects to glide, like many modern animals do today. At some point, the insects would’ve started flapping as they glided to increase their distance.

Once the flapping got powerful enough, they could achieve powered flight. That’s all there is to it - a perfectly smooth, seamless transition from not flying to flying.

Insects are just one example; I wanted to discuss them as they’re rarely talked about in answers on the evolution of flight.
