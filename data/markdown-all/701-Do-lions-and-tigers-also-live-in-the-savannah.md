Lions live in the African Savannah, especially in East and Southern Africa, where their numbers are highest. Also, they inhabit deserts, like the Namib, and woodland (E.g. Gir Forest).

The answer below states that tigers do not live in the savannah, but this is not entirely true. Yes, they are primarily forest animals, built for stealth and solitary hunting (It is thought that lions are social because of their unique habitat. Massive animals like elephants means massive carcasses, which means lots of scavengers. More lions make it easier to defend large kills.), but they do inhabit savannah as well. An example would be the Terai-Duar savannah in India.

So, your answer is: Yes, lions and tigers do both live in the savannah, but not in the same place.
