If you’ve read through the answers to this question, you’ll probably know every fact there is in existence about India, so to change things up a bit, here are some interesting facts about my country, Ireland.

*   As languages go, Irish is pretty unique. There is no word meaning “yes” or “no”, there are three different sets of numbers used when referring to different things, and like other Celtic languages, sentences are arranged with the verb first, then the subject, then the object (e.g. “Eats John food” instead of “John eats food.”)
*   Sean’s Bar, in the town of Athlone, is one of the oldest (still existent) companies in the entire world. It was established as an inn and trading post in the year 900 by a man named Luain (to whom the town owes its name, which is an anglicized version of “Áth Luain”). It’s quite possible that it once served Vikings. To this day, it’s still a popular pub.

*   On the subject of historical world records, we also have the oldest lighthouse still in use, the oldest yacht club, and the second-longest-running talk show - the Late Late Show, which has been broadcasting since 1961.
*   There is a road in the north of the country known as the N54 in the Republic. It enters Northern Ireland, where it’s called the A3, then crosses an Irish exclave, becoming the N54 again, then it goes back into N.I. as the A3, then finally ends in the Republic of Ireland, as the N54. In short, it changes name four times.

*   On Valentia Island (the third-largest offshore isle of Ireland), you can find the fossilized tracks of an ancient amphibious tetrapod, dating back to 385 million years ago. They are among the oldest evidence in the world of vertebrates venturing onto the land, and thus are of great scientific importance.

*   Another island off this country is Tory Island, which is unique because it has its own “kings”, of sorts. The island’s community chooses a resident to serve as the King of Tory, who has no actual powers, but speaks on behalf of the inhabitants and comes out to welcome all visitors to the island. The last one - a painter and musician- died in 2018, and a new one has not yet been chosen.

*   Lambay Island, near the capital Dublin, has some very exotic wildlife. In 1904, a man named Cecil Baring purchased it and introduced peacocks, kinkajous and flightless rheas. They didn’t do very well and have long since died out. However, his son inherited the island and seeded it with red-necked wallabies from Australia, which are still thriving and now number over 100.

*   Despite Ireland being its famous home, more Guinness is sold in Nigeria than here! The brand is quite popular in Africa, and the Nigerian Guinness brewery was its first operation outside Britain and Ireland.
*   Ireland’s most famous natural landmark (at least in the Republic) is the Cliffs of Moher in the west. They are up to 214 metres tall, and stretch along 14 km of coastline. What most do not know is that it has one of the world’s most dangerous mountain biking trails, less than a metre wide in parts. As far as I know, no one has died cycling here yet, but I fear it’s only a matter of time.

*   Speaking of sea cliffs, Ireland is home to the third largest in Europe - after Hornelen in mainland Norway and Cape Ennisberg in the Faroes. It forms one side of the mountain Croaghaun, on Achill Island, and towers some 688 metres above the sea. Achill is also the largest Irish isle.

*   In the 1840s, Ireland was hit by An Gorta Mór - the Great Famine. As a result, a million died and many more emigrated. In the infamous year of 1847, nicknamed Black ‘47, the native Choctaw of the US donated $170 (equivalent to several thousand dollars today) to the Irish, despite the fact that they too were suffering greatly at the time. A steel sculpture called Kindred Spirits has been erected in Cork in their honour.

*   One of the most baffling and mysterious deaths of recent times happened in Ireland. In 2009, a man checked into a Sligo hotel, and for five consecutive nights left with a bag of belongings which was empty every time he returned. After that, he was seen tearing up pieces of paper and putting the scraps in different bins. That afternoon, his naked body was found on a beach, along with clothing with the labels removed. He went by the alias of Peter Bergmann and no one knows how he died.

*   There are many Irish places with very long names - dozens and dozens of them with twenty letters or more, and in just one word. The longest of all is Bullaunancheathrairaluinn, which has 25.
*   Despite the fact that Irish is an endangered language (there are in fact more people fluent in Polish than Irish in the country), there is an official Gaeltacht in Ontario, Canada. A Gaeltacht is an area where Irish is widely spoken by the inhabitants. Being directly across the Atlantic, the Irish have left their mark on Canada, and Irish was also widely spoken in Newfoundland historically.

Those are the best facts I can think of at the moment, I hope you enjoyed. I might add more later. Thanks for reading!
