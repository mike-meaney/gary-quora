## Why are the grasses of the African savanna, and grains like wheat and barley, not green? Where is the chlorophyll that plants need for photosynthesis?

In the wild, there are a few usual culprits, such as nitrogen deficiency, lack of nutrients and lack of rainfall. The reason that grasslands exist is because their conditions are too harsh for trees to form forests, but not so harsh that they’re deserts.

In these trying circumstances, herbaceous plants - be it the red oat-grass of the Serengeti or wheat in a farmer’s field - are unable to produce as much chlorophyll as they normally would, so other pigments, like xanthophylls, show their colours.

The stereotypical image of an African savanna is similar to the above photograph - parched and yellow. In many places, the landscape does indeed look like this… for part of the year.

During the wet season, the grass has a lot more water, so it begins producing more chlorophyll. It’s like the way your skin tone gets duller if you don’t drink enough water.

The same is true of domestic grains. When rainfall is good and the soil is rich in nutrients, their colour changes to a much lusher green hue.
