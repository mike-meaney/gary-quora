Hunting is a fascinating behaviour, but a tricky one to catch at the right moment. I’ve seen a hunt in action a few times before. Here’s a secretarybird catching its prey (as indicated by the wings flaring up):

The quarry was probably a lizard or a snake, though I couldn’t make out what it was exactly. I saw a black-backed jackal pounce on something once, so I assume it was hunting. Most notably, a couple years ago I saw this cheetah give chase to a Thomson’s gazelle.

(Sorry for the terrible picture, it was pretty far away and I didn’t have a proper camera.)

Unfortunately for the cheetah, the gazelle was too far away and easily escaped. One thing that would be interesting to see is a hyena hunt, or maybe even a marine creature hunting. Those two items on my bucket list are unchecked, as of today.

Another fascinating behavior is [mobbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobbing_(animal_behavior) "en.wikipedia.org"), something many birds practice to ward off predators. I have seen this once, actually and it was pretty amazing. A large flock of wattled starlings, perhaps 100 strong, gave a brown snake eagle a run for his money.

Raptors are kind of bullied by almost all other types of birds, from hummingbirds to ducks. They must feel so lonely.
