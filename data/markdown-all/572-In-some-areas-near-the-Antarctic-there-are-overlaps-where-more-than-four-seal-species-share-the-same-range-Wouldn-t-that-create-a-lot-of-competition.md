## In some areas near the Antarctic, there are overlaps where more than four seal species share the same range. Wouldn't that create a lot of competition?

I assume the seals you’re talking about are the Ross seal, Weddell seal, crabeater seal, leopard seal, and Southern elephant seal. There are also Antarctic fur seals, but they only overlap with leopard seals.

So, first of all, we need to look at the respective niches of each of these species, since - depending on their niche - different species will be competing for different things.

Ross seal, Weddell seal: these ones do share the same ecological niche. They mainly feed on fish, and squid is also a common food source. However, there are differences which eliminate competition to a degree, which I’ll discuss in a moment.

Crabeater seal: this one’s actually quite an unusual seal in terms of diet, as it’s almost an obligate krill-eater. It even has specialized teeth for filter-feeding:

If whales ever go extinct, I’d bet on seals to take their place.

Southern elephant seal: elephant seals do have a significant niche overlap with the first two seals I mentioned, but they’re not obligate feeders of fish and squid, and supplement their diet with molluscs, crustaceans and algal matter.

Leopard seal: as you probably know, leopard seals are obligate hypercarnivores which prey mainly on birds and other seals, and thus have no niche overlap with any of the piscivorous/filter-feeding species.

So, that leaves Weddell seals and Ross seals - and to a certain degree, elephant seals - feeding on the same food source, in the same place. That’s not a lot of competition by ecological standards, but I can take this further just to really show the lack of competition.

We must remember that aquatic habitats are not only divided horizontally, like terrestrial ones, but vertically. Different species can hold their breath for longer, thermoregulate for longer, and withstand pressure for longer, so the deeper-diving species can specialize in deeper areas in order to avoid competition with other species.

Using data from Marianne Riedman’s 1990 paper The Pinnipeds, as well as information from the IUCN, here is a rough summary of the three competing seal’s maximum depths:

*   Elephant seal - 175 metres
*   Weddell seal - 600 metres
*   Ross seal - 792 metres

As you can see, there is a huge gap between the maximum depths, giving them plenty of room to feed, relatively free of competition.

Anyway, TL;DR: since leopard seals prey on tetrapods mainly and crabeaters are filter-feeders, the elephant, Ross and Weddell seals are the only one with majorly overlapping food sources, and they all can dive to different depths.
