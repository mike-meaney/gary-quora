Probably not, but maybe.

The main handicap with gaseous organisms is that gas molecules tend to disperse highly; itâ€™s therefore very difficult for the molecules to interact and form cells, reproduce, etc.

Perhaps if parts of said alien organisms were made of solid grains, they could provide sufficient gravity to keep some molecules together and act as a catalyst for reactions.
