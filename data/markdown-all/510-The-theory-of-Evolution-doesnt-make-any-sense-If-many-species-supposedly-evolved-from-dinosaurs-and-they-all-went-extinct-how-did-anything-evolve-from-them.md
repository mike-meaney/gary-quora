## The theory of Evolution doesn't make any sense. If many species supposedly evolved from dinosaurs and they all went extinct, how did anything evolve from them?

God, not another one of you lot. What does this look like to you?

A bird, you say? Wrong, you fool! Don’t you know it has more than six caudal vertebrae? Or that its pygostyle is not shorter than its femur? How could Ichthyornis possibly be a bird when it lacks those features?

My point is that there are scores of non-bird dinosaurs which, to the untrained eye, look exactly like birds. The fossil transition from the likes of dromaeosaurs to modern birds is seamless and well-studied.

The only “evolutionists” that think all dinosaurs went extinct are those that claim birds evolved from a different type of archosaur, and they are dismissed nowadays. Nobody has ever claimed both things simultaneously, because that would be shot down by peer review in a heartbeat.
