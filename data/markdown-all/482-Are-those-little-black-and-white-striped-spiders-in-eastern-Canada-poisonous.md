As far as I’m aware, there’s no such thing as a poisonous spider, because poison is only harmful to breathe, touch or eat. So, if you’re planning on eating this black and white spider, go ahead, you’ll be fine.

However, what most spiders are is venomous - however, spider venom is generally only an insecticide - in cases in which it is not and it is dangerous to humans, the spider which carries it is known as a medically significant spider.

There are only two medically significant spiders in Canada - black widows and brown recluses. Black widows are, well, black, and brown recluses are, um, brown. So, the answer is no.

For future reference, here are the two venomous spiders you want to look out for:

Side note - as regards what your striped spider actually is, it could be a lot of things. I’m thinking it might be a zebra spider, a parson spider, or maybe an orb-weaver of some kind.
