As David said, itâ€™s an adaptation for streamlining. Cheetahs are highly cursorial animals, and the atrophying of the head has allowed for air to more smoothly flow across the body and therefore minimize air resistance - which would slow them down - during a sprint.

Thanks for the A2A, hope this is a satisfactory answer.
