Animal behaviour

Let’s look at a scene in James Cameron’s Avatar. Don’t get me wrong, Avatar is a good movie and all that - but from a plausibility point of view, there are so many things wrong with this scene.

In the scene, Jake is pursued by an alien carnivore called a Thanator. Here’s how the scene starts.

The Thanator appears behind Jake, who is unaware of its presence. The Thanator is presented as a solitary, big cat-like predator, so it’s almost certainly supposed to be a stealthy ambush predator. Then - of all things - it starts to do this weird display thing where it curls up its lips and expands a crest.

Why would it do this when stalking its prey? That’s what a carnivore might do when squaring up to a rival - it could even pass for a courtship ritual. Then, it decides to snarl ferociously, completely blowing its cover. Yes, these things look and sound cool, but they make no ethological sense.

So then it turns out that the Thanator was actually eyeing up a herd of alien herbivores called hammerhead titanotheres, not Jake. The herd assumes a defensive formation, making them off the menu for the predator. The only way to prevent the titanotheres from doing that would be to 1) get in close, and 2) not blow your damn cover.

So the Thanator does some more random, pointless roaring, and sets its sights on Jake instead, which it for some reason didn’t go for in the first place. He runs, and the Thanator follows. This is where things get even more implausible.

So, during the pursuit, the predator acts really stupidly. It does lots of - you guessed it - unnecessary roaring, and crashes around banging into things like a bull in a china shop, not an agile animal in its natural habitat - look at footage of real large predators hunting; they glide through their environment with incredible grace.

And, most of all, it is inexplicably hellbent on catching Jake. It literally pulls apart tree trunks and plows through what look exactly like Earth bamboo shoots (that’s a whole different can of worms which I won’t open). When Jake hides under the roots of a tree, it starts hacking away at the tree, snarling and slavering ravenously all the while.

And then Jake literally opens fire on the Thanator with his machine gun, and it continues to attack. He makes a break for it, and the alien gives chase once again - more of the same, Thanator leaping around, roaring, smashing up stuff etc., until it actually catches Jake.

Instead of killing him quickly with a lethal bite, like virtually all solitary predators do, the Thanator decides to shake him around - by his backpack - like a ragdoll, and ends up flinging its fricking prey away. Jake runs again, the monster runs after him - all the way to the edge of a huge cliff; the Thanator actually has to scrabble to get back from the rim it was so enthusiastically pursuing Jake.

That’s just one scene, but it displays many aspects typical of a lot of Hollywood scenes involving large predators. You can see it everywhere - Jurassic Park, Jaws, Rampage, King Kong, you name it.

Constantly, animals are portrayed as being ruthless monsters which like to roar a lot for the audience and stop at nothing to kill their prey. I would love to see a film in which predators were depicted realistically - it might not be as spectacular, but it’d be an interesting and refreshing change.
