## What do Christians believe about dinosaurs, since they think the Earth is only a few thousand years old? Do they really believe dinosaurs existed recently, or do they think scientists are making them up?

Most Christians are reasonable enough to know that not all of the Bible should be taken literally, and as such they accept the science of paleontology along with all other science.

However, the small minority of Christians who are Young Earth Creationists have differing views on the existence of dinosaurs - a few today still continue to believe that fossils were either put there by the Devil (and somehow the omnipotent God couldn't care to remove them), or that they are a test of faith from God himself.

Other YEC folk believe that dinosaurs were real, only that birds aren’t dinosaurs, and - wait for it - they coexisted with humans, just like in the Flintstones. And, what’s more, in the Garden of Eden, the carnivorous dinosaurs were nice and vegetarian. And also really inaccurately reconstructed.

Never underestimate human stupidity, as they say. In the word’s of George Carlin, “Think of how stupid the average person is and then realize that half of all people are stupider than that”.
