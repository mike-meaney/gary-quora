There are two different opposing hypotheses on the evolution of pinnipeds - the first is that they evolved separately, with eared seals and walruses being closely related to bears, while true seals evolved from more otter-like creatures.

According to this hypothesis, amphicynodontines (meaning “both dog toothed”) such as Kolponomos are possible ancestors of walruses, fur seals and indeed sea lions. However, Kolponomos and kin are generally thought to be within the bear family.

In any case, the second hypothesis - that seals, eared seals and walruses form a single group - is now the prevailing one, due to evidence from cladistics and DNA. These days, it seems like all pinnipeds started out as creatures similar to Puijila darwini, a 24 million year-old otter-like animal, about a metre long.

Puijila’s (or one of its cousins’) descendants gradually became more specialized for the aquatic way of life, developing flattened flippers and flexible spines. An example of a fossil taxon in this stage of pinniped evolution is the bizarre-looking Enaliarctos.

Roughly 28 million years ago, the Otarioid (walrus and eared seal) and Phocoid (true seal and kin) lineages diverged. The Otariidae family, to which sea lions belong, first appears in the fossil record roughly 16–17 million years ago, with the species Eotaria crypta (bottom right).

The family is split into two subfamilies - Arctocephalinae, meaning “bear-headed”, the fur seals, and Otariinae, meaning “little ears”, the sea lions.

Unfortunately, very little is known about early sea lions, except that they emerged sometime after 11 mya. All of the extinct otariids we know of are in the fur seal subfamily.
