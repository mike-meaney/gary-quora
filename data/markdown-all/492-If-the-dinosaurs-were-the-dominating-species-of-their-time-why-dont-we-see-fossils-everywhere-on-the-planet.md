Each dot represents a cluster of fossil sites in which dinosaurs have been unearthed. According to the Database, members of Dinosauria have been found in 10,802 collections and a total of 27,783 dinosaur fossils, which have been - as you can see - discovered on every continent including Antarctica.

Imagine how many lie in those blank spaces which are hard to reach; the Antarctic interior, the Siberian tundra, the Canadian Arctic and the deserts of Australia. So, to answer your question; we do.
