## Why can a leopard and a lion not breed yet they belong to the same genus?

Leopards and lions breeding is virtually implausible in the wild, but there are in fact leopard-lion hybrids bred in captivity.

When you breed a lioness with a male leopard, you get a “leopon”. Its head is leonine, while it sports a short, tawny mane - interesting, because the leopon is the result of a female lion and a leopard. On its body, it has rosettes like a leopard, and is pale on its underparts.

Then, when you breed a female leopard with a male lion, you get a “lipard”. These are slightly better documented than leopons, as we have some surviving modern examples. Essentially, they look very like lionesses (Again, very interesting, because the lion parent of a lipard must be male.), except with faded or chocolate-coloured rosettes.

Why leopons, from female lions, have short manes, and lipards, from male lions, have none, I do not know. I presume its something to do with the male and female hormones from the two species, but I’m no endocrinologist, so I can’t say for sure.
