## What are the physical differences between a liger and a tigon? The two look pretty similar to me.

Here’s two ligers (Female on the left, male on the right)

As you may know, the liger is the offspring of a male lion, and a female tiger. Ligers have tawny fur like a lion, with very faint tiger stripes. They may also have rosettes inherited from the lion parent (Lion cubs have spots which they lose when they’re older). These markings may be sandy, like the ones in the picture have, but also are recorded being brown and even black. The darker the markings, the darker the ground colour. They also have a pale underside, like tigers, and male ligers have short manes.

There’s also such thing as a “white liger”, the result of a male lion and a female white tiger. Their coat colour is unmarked, and varies from pure white to pale golden.

Scientists postulate that more interesting ligers could be born from a male lion bred with a pseudo-melanistic tigress, or (If there were any living Maltese tigers), blue-grey ligers.

Ligers are also very big (Possibly because of the male lion genes), about the size of an extinct Smilodon populator. Ligers are the largest non-obese felids in the world, with one liger called Nook weighing a hefty 550 kilograms.

Then we have tigons (Male tiger x Lioness).

Whereas the liger is larger than its parents, the tigon tends to be about the same size or smaller than an average lioness or tiger. This is because of growth-inhibitory genes inherited from the mother.

As you can see in the picture, their coat is orange, with a pale underside and slightly darker orange stripes. The males have long fur around their neck and face, but it is perhaps too short to call it a mane, being more like a male tiger’s facial ruff. Like the liger, they can inherit small rosettes from their lion parent.

Because of their lioness parent, they are less muscularly built than their liger cousins, having an overall more gracile form.

Tigons are less well-documented than ligers, so it is unknown whether melanistic, pseudo-melanistic, white or Maltese forms are possible. However, tigons do have some similarities to tigers with a colour mutation known as “Golden tabby”, which may indicate more compatible genes.

I hope I answered your question well, thanks for asking me.
