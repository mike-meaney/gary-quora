The lammergeier, also known as the bearded vulture or ossifrage, is a striking bird of prey which is found in southern Europe, east Africa and much of Central Asia. At 4.5 to 7.8 kilograms, it’s pretty big for a flying bird. Here are some interesting facts.

*   It’s not actually a vulture. Despite commonly being called the “bearded vulture”, it actually lies outside the Old World vulture group, Aegypiinae, instead forming its own group - Gypaetinae - with its closest living relative, the similarly misnamed Egyptian vulture (pictured).

*   It uses makeup. Lammergeiers have unmistakeable, golden-orange plumage - but, believe it or not, this colour isn’t natural. The feathers themselves are white, and the golden hue comes from bathing in oxide-rich dust and mud. Presumably, this makes them more attractive, and is one of the very few examples of cosmetics in the animal world.

*   It eats more bone than any other vertebrate. 70%, sometimes even 90%, of the bearded vulture’s diet consists of just bone and bone marrow. No other bird, or vertebrate for that matter, is this specialized for osteophagy, as it’s called, although certain invertebrates - such as zombie worms, eat more.

*   One killed a famous Greek playwright. It’s said that the ancient Greek Aeschylus, known as the “father of tragedy”, was killed when a bird dropped a tortoise on his head. If this is true, a bearded vulture is likely the culprit - if a bone (or indeed a tortoise) is too tough, they’ll soar with it to 50–150 metres off the ground and drop it, making it shatter.
