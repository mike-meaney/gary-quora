Yes, quite a lot actually. The national animal of Iran is the Asiatic lion, which now only exists in the wild in India’s Gir Forest. However, earlier this year, the country obtained a pair of lions which will hopefully reproduce and be released into the wild.

Lions of the African variety are the national animals in many countries, including Morocco, Libya and Togo - they all had lions at one point, but no longer do.

Additionally, Belgium, The Netherlands, Luxembourg, North Macedonia, Norway, and England have the lion as national animal. Of these, only Macedonia had true lions (until some 2,000 years ago), while the rest - except Norway - were once home to Panthera spelaea, the cave lion, in the Pleistocene.

Sri Lanka and Singapore are also countries which proclaim lions as their national animal, but never had them.

The national animal of Moldova is the aurochs, which went extinct in the wild in 1627, and in the 13th Century in Moldova specifically. Although, from a certain point of view, this one might not count, since cattle are a domestic form of the aurochs.

The national animal of Mauritius is the dodo, which I’m sure we all know is extinct.

Mexico’s national aquatic animal is the vaquita, a species of porpoise. Tragically, within a few years it could make this list, since there’s likely no more than 10 vaquitas left, and none of them are in captivity. They are perhaps the world’s most critically endangered vertebrate.

Oman’s national animal is the Arabian oryx. For decades, it was extinct in the country, but thankfully it’s been reintroduced. It’s also the national animal of Qatar and the UAE, which might count on this list since, while oryx have been reintroduced there, they’re not really wild.

While the Eurasian lynx is found very close by, there are none in Serbia, where it is the national animal.

The Siberian tiger has been extinct in South Korea for over a century, and is the country’s national animal. Interestingly enough, there may be some in North Korea.

Lastly, many countries’ national animals do not exist, because they are mythical; namely Germany and Austria (Bundesadler), China (Chinese dragon), Bhutan (Druk), the Czech Republic (double-tailed lion), Greece (phoenix), Hungary (turul), Indonesia (garuda), North Korea (Chollima), Portugal (Rooster of Barcelos), Russia (double-headed eagle), Serbia (white eagle), Scotland (unicorn) and Wales (dragon).

I know you said “compromised” as well, but if I was to list ones with endangered national animals too, I’d be here all day. To conclude, we have 10 countries where the national animal has gone extinct, 3 where it was never found, 1 where it was once extinct, another where it sadly soon will be, 4 which are a bit iffy, and 13 with mythical national animals.
