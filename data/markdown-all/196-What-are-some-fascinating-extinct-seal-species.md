Good question - I’m glad you asked. Here are a few of my favourites.

*   Hadrokirus \- This was a genus of seal which lived on the Peruvian coast, about 6 million years ago. It was a true giant - more than eight feet long - but it’s most unique because of its teeth. These were extremely robust and powerful, indicating it was either a bone-crusher - a marine hyena, if you will - or fed on a diet of hard-shelled invertebrates, like a sea otter would.

*   Thalassoleon \- this genus is not one of true seals, but rather fur seals. However, Thalassoleon was much bigger than any fur seal today. One species - T. macnallyae of Miocene California - was probably as big as a walrus! Other specimens are known from Mexico and Japan. The generic name literally translates to “lion of the sea”, and is quite fitting.

*   Praepusa \- Another seal genus from the Miocene. The most interesting thing about Praepusa was that it was tiny - perhaps only 60 centimetres long. This would make it one of the smallest marine mammals in history. Some species dwelt in the shallow seas that are now the Benelux countries, whereas others were found in the Paratethys - a vanished inland ocean which the Caspian and Black Seas are remnants of.

*   Pontolis \- Pontolis magnus was likely one of the most dangerous pinnipeds ever. A species of walrus, it far surpassed even the modern species in size - in fact, some estimates put it at a staggering 4 tons! A typical bull Asian elephant weighs 4 tons, too. It also had four short tusks, instead of two long ones. It lived on the West Coast of the US in the Miocene and Pliocene.

*   Nanodobenus \- or, as I like to call it, the “smallrus”. Despite being a member of the walrus family, it was a pathetic 1.6 metres in length, shorter than the average person is tall. And, to add insult to injury, it didn’t even have tusks -it was basically a sea lion which took a wrong turn and ended up in the walrus family. Nanodobenus lived in Mexico, in the Miocene.

So there you have it - five different extinct species of pinnipeds, which I’m guessing you hadn’t previously heard of. You’ll notice that all of them are from the Miocene and Pliocene epochs - that’s unintentional, it’s just that that period had a great diversity of marine mammals.

In fact, all of these species likely coexisted with the famous shark Carcharocles megalodon, and, in the case of some, the super-sperm whale Livyatan. I hope you’ve enjoyed the answer, and that you learned a few new things.
