So far, it seems like California sea lions (Zalophus californianius) and harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) are the most intelligent of pinnipeds, for a number of reasons.

I’m sure you’ve seen sea lions balancing a ball on their nose, or at least heard of the iconic act:

This actually requires a good sense of concentration and balance, as well as the fact that they can be taught tasks by humans, much like a dog. Sea lions have also been:

*   Seen to understand symmetry, transitivity and equivalence
*   Observed bobbing their head to music (Something which actually does require intelligence - it’s rhythmic entertainment and embodies pattern recognition)
*   Trained to speak an artificial sign language, which includes basic syntax
*   Known to have long-term memory (They can perform the ball balancing act after 3 months of not doing it)

Sea lions appear to be adept at learning, especially rather human-like systems, methods, or ways of thinking, which is quite interesting. True seals, or phocids, aren’t as well studied as sea lions in terms of cognitive abilities, but harbor seals seem especially intelligent.

In 1971, a captive seal called Hoover learned to imitate human speech, and spoke in his owner’s gruff New England accent phrases like “Hello there!” and “Come over here!”.

In conclusion, seals and sea lions seem to be highly intelligent animals, with brains adapted for quick self-learning. However, I wouldn’t put them in the league of chimpanzees or dolphins.
