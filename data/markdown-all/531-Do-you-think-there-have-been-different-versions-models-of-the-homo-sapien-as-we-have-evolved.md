Yes, there have been.

Currently, there are two confirmed subspecies of Homo sapiens, with several more unconfirmed. The only one which survives to the present is Homo sapiens sapiens, the type subspecies.

This is a famous reconstruction of an extinct subspecies, Homo sapiens idaltu. Also known as Herto man, H. s. idaltu lived in the Afar Triangle of Ethiopia some 160,000 years ago. Other than the ones from that deposit, we have no other fossils.

Of the unclear subspecies, the two most widely accepted are H. s. neandertalensis, Neanderthal man, and H. s. rhodesiensis, Rhodesian man. I tend to hold with those who classify them as their own species, but let’s introduce them briefly.

You’ve probably heard of Neanderthals. They were stocky, strong humans native to Africa and Eurasia, very similar to us in many respects - they developed complex tools, and even evolved pale skin convergently with Homo sapiens (sapiens) Europeans (and other peoples like Native Americans, Arabs and East Asians)

Then there’s Rhodesian man. Homo rhodesiensis is generally considered synonymous with Homo heidelbergensis, so it’s not really its own species anyway. Its bones were discovered in Zambia and date back to 800,000 to 120,000 years ago.

There are many other proposed Homo sapiens subspecies, including H. s. grimaldiensis, and H. s. cro-magnonensis. Carl Linnaeus, the founder of Linnaean taxonomy, originally divided our species into many subspecies based on the so-called “races” of human, but we now know that blacks, whites, Asians and all the rest are virtually identical.
