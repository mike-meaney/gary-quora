## I wonder how those persons who consider humans natural carnivores would fare in the wild naked and with no tools against other animals?

That’s not the natural state of humans, though. Tool-making has been been with our lineage since Australopithecus, at least, and even the first anatomically modern humans likely had clothes, spears, and the like. Tool use is as much a part of our nature as claws are to a leopard.

Naked and with no tools, yeah, they’d be screwed. But like this:

I mean, some of them would probably die, but they'd have far better chances. In general, humans are omnivorous in their "natural" state, but a fully carnivorous diet is certainly possible - just look at the Inuit peoples of the North American Arctic, who eat only fish, seals, caribou and the like (supplemented, if possible, with a small percentage of plant matter) - in the right conditions.
