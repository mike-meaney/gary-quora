## If birds descend from some dinosaur species, why did that species, and that one alone amongst all dinosaurs, survive?

There are a few reasons, or at least hypotheses. It was probably a combination of several, or all, of these that helped birds survive the K-Pg extinction.

*   Size \- the birds that survived were pretty small. The bigger you are, the more food you need to fuel your mass, so smaller animals are typically better at lasting out severe food shortages.
*   Diet \-Much of their diet was comprised of detritus, of which there was of course plenty, and insects, which were relatively unaffected by the extinction. Other birds lived on seeds, which stay edible for many years and are likely to survive even when their plants die.
*   Intelligence \- according to this paper - [Avian brain evolution: new data from Palaeogene birds (Lower Eocene) from England](https://academic.oup.com/zoolinnean/article/155/1/198/2674320 "academic.oup.com") - birds’ large relative brain size compared to other dinosaurs might have helped them adapt to the rapid change.
*   Flight \- the ability of flight means that birds can traverse large distances to forage for food. This surely helped in the lean times when food items were few and far between.

That’s all I can think of for now. Hope this answers your question.
