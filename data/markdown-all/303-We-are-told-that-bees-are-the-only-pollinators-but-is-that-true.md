I don’t know which authoritarian Ministry of Truth has been telling you that bees are the only pollinators, but whoever they are, they are incorrect. Pollination is a behaviour which has evolved an incredible number of times in the animal kingdom.

Among insects other than bees, we have a plethora of interesting examples. There are several instances of pollination arising in wasps, with perhaps no better example than the aptly-named pollen wasps.

Found in desert regions of Africa and the Americas, these insects flit from flower to flower, gathering pollen and nectar which is stored for later in a pouch in the throat (crop). After digging a small chamber in mud or earth, they regurgitate the mixture into the burrow and lay their eggs inside. This way, the young enter this world already immersed in food.

A wide variety of flies pollinate - in fact, in high-altitude regions, they are often prevail over bees. Take, for example, Philoliche longirostris, a species native to the Himalayas. In order to reach the nectar of extra-long flowers, it has an extraordinary proboscis that can be several times longer than the rest of the body.

Many carrion flies (as well as scavenging beetles) become unwilling pollinators, duped by crafty flora. A myriad of plant lineages have independently evolved carrion flowers - flowers with the alluring fragrance of rotting meat. There are some truly spectacular ones, like the towering titan arum and the giant padma, the world’s largest flower (both pictured below).

Carnivorous flies and beetles smell these, thinking they’ve found themselves a meaty carcass, and lay their eggs in the flowers. When the offspring hatch, they have no food and die off, but the parents often accidentally collect and spread pollen during the egg-laying process.

On a less gruesome note, there’s also a whole adorable family of flies called the bee flies, containing nearly 5,000 species, many of which are pollinators. They resemble little golden fuzzballs! We return back to the realm of gruesomeness with the fact that bee fly larvae attack, parasitize and kill hosts such as beetles.

As I’m sure many of you know, butterflies and moths are important to the pollination process too. One of the most impressive-looking examples has got to be Morgan’s sphinx, a species which also has particular historical significance.

Morgan’s sphinx was the first accurate prediction made using the theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1862, Charles Darwin encountered an incredibly long orchid flower collected in Madagascar, and reasoned that there must be a local pollinating insect with a proboscis of the same length. His contemporary, Alfred Russell Wallace, further hypothesized that this mystery pollinator would be a sphinx moth. He wrote that:

> That such a moth exists in Madagascar may be safely predicted; and naturalists who visit that island should search for it with as much confidence as astronomers searched for the planet Neptune,

Sure enough, in 1867, the Madagascan subspecies of Morgan’s sphinx was discovered, with a tongue exactly long enough to penetrate Darwin’s orchid.

Earlier, I mentioned that some beetles pollinate carrion flowers. There are 400,000 known species of beetle, so - as you would expect - a handful of them have adapted to the pollinator lifestyle. One especially cool group is the colourful monkey beetles, a subdivision of scarabs.

South Africa is home to an astounding diversity of monkey beetles, boasting over a thousand species.

Believe it or not, pollination even happens under the sea. The only flowering plants found in the world’s oceans are seagrasses, and most of them simply use the currents of the water to distribute their pollen to pastures new. However, in 2016, it was discovered that at least one seagrass species utilizes animal pollination.

The experiment found that turtlegrass in an aquarium could reproduce just fine when they stopped the current from flowing. However, it could not when the water was cleansed of microscopic animals, or zooplankton. Thus, we found that these teeny tiny critters, like amphipods and polychaete worms, act as bees of the seas.

And all that just covers the most interesting specimens from the invertebrate world. There is quite a variety of pollinating characters amongst the vertebrates, too. All over the world, different birds have evolved to step up to the task - hummingbirds in the Americas, sunbirds in Africa and Asia, and honeyeaters in Australasia.

Hummingbirds in particular are endlessly fascinating, as I have [written about in depth](https://www.quora.com/Which-birds-are-more-strange-than-most-people-realize/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") before. From their freakishly unique physiology and highly specialized diet to their incredible skills in aviation and acute vision, there’s nothing not to love about hummingbirds.

Hummingbirds are mainly active during the day, so in the pollination game, bats rule the night. There’s even a special term to describe plants which are pollinated by bats - chiropterophily. In Africa and Asia, flying foxes do the work:

Whereas in the Americas, their counterparts are various species of New World leaf-nosed bats.

There are many, many more obscure vertebrates which play roles in pollination, too. I’m talking mice:

Elephant shrews:

The largest pollinators in the world, lemurs:

And the unique, beautiful kinkajou. This South American critter was originally classified as a primate, due to its bendy prehensile tail. We now know that it’s actually a carnivoran, closely related to raccoons.

The greatest mammalian pollinating oddball of all would have to be the honey possum. This is a little marsupial which roams southwest Australia, and - due to its sugary diet of nectar - has a supercharged metabolism similar to that of hummingbirds.

It gets… weirder, I must say. For its size, the honey possum has the largest testes of any animal on the planet, as they account for around 5% of its bodyweight! The sperm cells they produce are likewise larger than life, eclipsing even those of blue whales in size.

So, that was a strange note to end on, to the say the least, but to answer your question: there are absolutely pollinators other than bees. Above is not an exhaustive encyclopaedia of all of them, but rather a hand-picked selection of only the most delectable morsels of useless knowledge. Thank you very much for reading, have a great day.
