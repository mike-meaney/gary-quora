## How accurate is the recent viral video showing 20 hyenas attacking a lion? Was it 'doctored' in any way?

As far as I know, no. Such events are well known, and are seen in much older photos (Such as in Hans Kruukâ€™s 1967 The Spotted Hyena), bbefore such editing was possible. I myself have seen firsthand lionesses attacked in groups of about 7, but that number is usually higher.
