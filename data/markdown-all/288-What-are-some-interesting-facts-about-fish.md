When it comes to diversity, fish are far superior to us pathetic tetrapods

In terms of variety of form and weirdness, bony fish easily trump any other vertebrate group. When was the last time you saw a tetrapod which:

*   Literally melds into its mate, even fusing organ systems, and becomes a chimera. (Sea devils)

*   Has a population of trillions, possibly even quadrillions (Bristlemouths)

*   Is always born male and then changes into a female later in life (Many fish)

*   Grows an organ which mimics the larvae of its own kind (Reef basslets)

*   Latches onto the gills of other animals and lives there as a parasite (Candirus)

*   Lives inside the goddamn heart of other animals (Pug-nosed eels)

*   Can eat animals several times its size, sometimes ending up bursting its own stomach (Black swallowers)

*   Lives its life exclusively in underground waterfalls, filtering food from the cascade (Waterfall climbing cave fish)

*   Has, over evolutionary time, lost its ribs, fins, swim bladder, scales, and even its upper jaw (Onejaws)

*   Has a jaw that looks like… well, this: (Stoplight loosejaws)

*   Has ridiculously derived eyes which are flat, point upwards and have no lenses (Ipnops)

*   Can generate electricity. We might take it for granted since the likes of electric eels are very well-known, but fish are the only animals which can do this. (Electric eels, electric rays etc.)

*   Has two sets of functional jaws (Moray eels)

*   Has its eyes on huge stalks up to half as long as its body (Black dragonfish)

For animals typically seen as being quite familiar and mundane in the grand scheme of things, fish are really, really strange. Imagine a mammal with a mouth structure as complex as the stoplight loosejaw’s, or a snake which lived inside the hearts of larger creatures as pug-nosed eels do.
