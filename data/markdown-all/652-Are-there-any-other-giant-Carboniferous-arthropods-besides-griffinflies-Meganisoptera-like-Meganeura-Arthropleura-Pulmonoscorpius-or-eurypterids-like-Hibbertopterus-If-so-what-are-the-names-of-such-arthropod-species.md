## Are there any other giant Carboniferous arthropods, besides griffinflies (Meganisoptera, like Meganeura), Arthropleura, Pulmonoscorpius, or eurypterids (like Hibbertopterus)? If so, what are the names of such arthropod species?

Nope, that’s them all. This is one of the reasons why I would argue that the Carboniferous period is exaggerated in that arthropods didn’t really dominate the world at all, it would just seem that some species grew to unusual sizes; meanwhile, we have countless fossils of amphibians, reptiles and even synapsids from the Carboniferous - so it would seem that tetrapods were the ruling group at the time.
