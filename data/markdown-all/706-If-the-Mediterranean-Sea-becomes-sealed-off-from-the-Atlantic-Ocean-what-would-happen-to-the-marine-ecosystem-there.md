The flow of water will stop, and itâ€™ll all evaporate, leaving a salt flat. Almost all the marine organisms will die, and the only habitat left for the hardiest will be brine lakes like these:

Only microbes can survive here. The water is highly toxic, being ten times saltier than the sea. Clouds of brine flies may gather to feed on the algae.

The countless small islands of the Mediterranean will turn into patches of karst:

Which will stick out above the salt flat and provide a home for some more advanced life forms.

So, in short; everything dies, except the bacteria. Yay.
