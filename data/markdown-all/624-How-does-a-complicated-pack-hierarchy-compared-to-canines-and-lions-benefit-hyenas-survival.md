Well, for the dominant females, there are obvious advantages. They have the choice of mates, and they’re the first to feed. Hyena clan members often have blood ties, so even the subordinates will benefit in helping their dominant relatives. And, for clarity, I mean this from the genes’ eye-view.

Another benefit for the lower-ranking individuals is that - as studies on baboons have shown - dominant animals often experience high testosterone and stress levels which can put them at a selective disadvantage. Subordinates, obviously, don’t have this issue.

Lastly, the hierarchical system also organizes things better, which helps during hunt.

Thanks for your A2As everybody.
