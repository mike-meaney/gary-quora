That would be the coconut crab. It’s not only the largest terrestrial arthropod commonly eaten by humans, but it’s the largest terrestrial invertebrate, full stop.

This colossal crustacean can weigh up to four kilograms, and its leg span measures a metre across! When coconut crabs start out in life, however, they look nothing like that - in fact, the babies (known as zoae) begin as microscopic plankton floating in the sea.

If these teeny weeny larvae survive long enough, they metamorphose into larger forms, called glaucothoes. The glaucothoes find seashells - or, sometimes, broken coconut shells - to wear as protection from predators.

Eventually, they surface and take to dry land, growing larger still and shedding their old shell. Instead, they develop a remarkably tough exoskeleton, reinforced with chitin and calcite. This has a defensive purpose, but also serves to prevent water loss outside the sea - one of the many adaptations coconut crabs have for the terrestrial way of life.

In my opinion, the most interesting of these adaptations is their respiratory system. They have a very unique organ called a branchiostegal lung, essentially an inside-out set of gills which absorbs atmospheric oxygen, rather than the dissolved oxygen of the sea. This has to be kept moist at all times, so they frequently use their back legs to rub it with water.

Coconut crabs also have an excellent sense of smell, which of course works very differently to that of their aquatic relatives. Interestingly enough, their olfaction is quite similar to that of insects, a case of convergent evolution.

As you can probably guess, this sense of smell is used to track down food. They usually eat fruit, nuts, coconuts, seeds, and the like, but they are far from fussy, and will gladly eat carrion, or even kill live rats, turtles, and seabirds! The photo below is a pretty damn nightmarish shot.

Speaking of eating, and more relevant to your question, coconut crabs are considered a traditional delicacy on many of the islands they inhabit, especially the more remote ones. This is one of the main threats to the species, as they are classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN.

That being said, it’s possible that the crabs have had their revenge against us humans. I’m sure you’re all familiar with Amelia Earhart, the pilot who had to make an emergency landing on a far-flung isle of Kiribati, and whose remains were never found.

Believe it or not, some people theorize that this is because her body was picked clean by scavenging coconut crabs…

Though it may seem far-fetched, I’d say it’s certainly plausible. While investigating this, TIGHAR (The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery) ran an experiment involving coconut crabs and a large pig carcass. It was stripped to the bone in a couple of weeks, and its skeleton was dismantled by the crabs shortly thereafter.

Now, some bonus facts which are worth knowing about these guys. The coconut crab has a pretty far-reaching distribution across much of the Indian Ocean, and some of the Pacific, too. It’s found (mainly on small islands) from East Africa to Southeast Asia to French Polynesia.

The wicked claws of the coconut crab are a serious force to be reckoned with. Their pinch strength has been measured at a bone-cracking 3,000 newtons, in comparison to studies which find the average man’s pinch grip to be 87 newtons!

Anyway, hopefully that was a good rundown of this unusual and frighteningly huge species of arthropod. I myself would be curious to taste one, though hopefully I would not befall the alleged fate of Amelia Earhart and be tasted.

Thank you very much for reading, have a great day.
