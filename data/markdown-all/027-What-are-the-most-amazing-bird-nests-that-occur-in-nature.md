Birds’ nests are a lot more diverse and amazing than most people realize. When I say the word “bird’s nest”, you probably think of a small, bowl-shaped arrangement of twigs. Yet they are so much more varied.

Sociable weavers build incredible colonial nests. They are small, brown birds which are found in Southern Africa. Weavers are so named because of their iconic hanging nests, but the nests of this species are on another level altogether.

These are enormous, multitonne masses of straw, larger than any other bird’s nest. The many chambers found within can support hundreds of weavers, and are also used by many other species of bird, and even snakes and lizards.

In some cases, the weavers will build their nests on utility poles. These look even more bizarre than the ones built in trees, and have been known to cause short circuits!

Some sociable weaver nests are thought to have been continuously inhabited for over a century. However, the gyrfalcon scoffs at this. The largest species of falcon, this polar raptor does not build a nest out of twigs, but rather scrapes itself one into a rocky cliff face.

One gyrfalcon nest in Greenland was determined - via carbon dating - to be in the region of 2,500 years old! On the same cliff, the very youngest of nests were at least 500 years old. Based on the analysis, the falcon’s nest could have first been clawed out of the rock while Babylon was the largest city in the world.

Another strange type of bird nest is that used by the megapodes. Megapodes are a family of gamebirds found east of the Wallace Line, except for in some islands in the Bay of Bengal. They are so named for their very large feet, which are used instead of an egg tooth to emerge from the egg at birth.

Megapodes are very lazy when it comes to parenting, and since sitting on a nest for weeks is an awful lot of trouble, they instead build enormous, dome-shaped mounds out of leaf litter or volcanic ash, which naturally incubate the eggs. Look at the size of this one.

Lastly, I’ll mention the bizarre nests which many swiftlets construct. Swiftlets are swallow-like birds related to hummingbirds, and a variety of them - most famously the edible-nest swiftlet - make their nests out of their own saliva.

White and translucent, they are built on cliffs and are formed entirely by the mother’s solidified spit. In China, these nests are actually prized as a delicacy, because they are rich in flavour and protein. The saliva is used to make the ancient Chinese dish known as birds-nest soup.

So, those are the four bird nests which I find are the most amazing. The nesting world is so much more than the standard “cup” type which we all know. Thanks for reading!
