## How is body temperature in humans and other animals maintained? Which chemical reactions occur in the body that give off heat? How is this temperature related? And lastly, why do different animals have different body temperatures?

> Which chemical reactions occur in the body that give off heat?

Inside your cells are thousands of little bacteria called mitochondria, I’m sure you’ve heard of them. They turn glucose into energy, but as they do this, they produce heat energy.

> How is body temperature in humans and other animals maintained?

This applies to all organisms, but creatures which maintain their internal body temperature - endotherms or warm-blooded animals - have measures in place to stop some of this heat as it radiates out. These include subcutaneous fat layers, fur, and feathers.

To cool down, endotherms will pant, flush blood to the skin (heat can only be shed through the external surface area), or - in the case of humans - sweat.

> Why do different animals have different body temperatures?

A number of reasons. For one thing, the greater your volume, the more cells you have. The more cells you have, the more mitochondria you have, and the more mitochondria you have the more heat you produce. In short, larger animals have higher body temperatures.

Warm-blooded animals usually have higher internal body temperatures than cold-blooded ones. Also, heat is produced by performing very energy-expensive tasks - the human brain produces loads of it.
