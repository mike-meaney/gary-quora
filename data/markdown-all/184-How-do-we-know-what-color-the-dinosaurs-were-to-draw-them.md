We actually already know the colour patterns of nine extinct dinosaur species: Sinosauropteryx, Anchiornis, Archaeopteryx, Microraptor, Caihong, Cruralispenna, Inkayacu and Borealopelta, which is illustrated below. The microscopic imprints of melanosomes (pigment-storing structures within the cells) have been identified on their fossilized feathers, or scales in the case of Borealopelta.

For a more in-depth explanation of all that, you can have a look at this answer: [Does anyone really know what colours dinosaurs were? So often they are depicted as drab browns and greens, why is that?](https://www.quora.com/Does-anyone-really-know-what-colours-dinosaurs-were-So-often-they-are-depicted-as-drab-browns-and-greens-why-is-that/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")

For the rest, however, paleoartists have to give their best guess as to how their colouration might have looked. In the early days of paleontology, dinosaurs were typically imagined as great lumbering lizards, and most artists gave them rather drab hues: washed-out greens, greys, browns and the like.

The last painting, Leaping Laelaps, was actually ahead of its time, mind you. It depicted dinosaurs moving with intensity and agility, whereas the vast majority of preceding artworks portrayed them as sluggish beasts.

While it’s possible (if not probable) that many types of dinosaur did indeed sport muted colour schemes, there’s been something of a paradigm shift in the paleoart community over the last few decades. Dinosaurs - we now know - were warm-blooded, and often had feathered coats. In modern reconstructions, they are painted in a more vibrant light.

After all, there are living, breathing dinosaurs we can observe firsthand - birds - and plenty of them are vividly colourful. Unlike modern reptiles, non-avian dinosaurs had feathery plumage, were warm-blooded and active, and likely encountered more complex social interactions.

One might argue that today’s mammals have fur, are warm-blooded, and have very complex social interactions, but are usually subdued shades of brown, yellow, grey and so on. However, keep in mind that dinosaurs would have had more advanced colour vision than mammals: they were [trichromats](https://www.quora.com/If-wild-animals-both-predators-and-prey-adapted-their-appearance-to-be-a-camo-in-their-natural-habitats-why-are-none-of-them-green/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com").

Nevertheless, we can still learn much from mammals, and other modern wildlife. Based on what we see in the natural world today, it’s reasonable to assume that most desert-dwelling dinosaurs would be tawny in colour.

Many species would have obeyed Thayer’s Law; the principle that animals usually have paler colouration on their underside than on their back. When the sun shines downward on an animal, its underparts become shadowed. A lighter hue cancels out this shadow, and thus makes the animal more evenly camouflaged.

This is supported by what little we know for certain about some dinosaurs’ colour schemes. Two of the nine species I mentioned at the start seemingly had this upper-lower contrast (known as countershading): Borealopelta and Psittacosaurus. The latter is shown below.

Another inference we can make based on extant fauna is that highly aquatic dinosaurs - Spinosaurus being the only one we’re sure of so far - might well have had a dark or plain colour overall, like hippos, cetaceans and many crocodilians.

Of course, Spinosaurus’ huge paddle tail, iconic sail and head crest were each possible locations of display features; perhaps they were more colourful. It’s open to interpretation.

And that’s really the gist of what I’m saying here: if you want to draw a plausible dinosaur, be sure to use logic and observed trends in modern animals as a guide, but by all means use your imagination too. That’s the fun part about paleoart.
