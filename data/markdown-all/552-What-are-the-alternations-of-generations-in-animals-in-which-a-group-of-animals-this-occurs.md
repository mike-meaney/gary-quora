There’s no such thing as alternation of generations, or metagenesis, in animals. To quickly explain what metagenesis is, it’s something that happens in plants, and some fungi and slime moulds.

Basically, the organism alternates between two forms in its life cycle. One form has one set of chromosomes, the gametophyte, while the other has two, the sporophyte. An example would be moss - it starts out as a green, leafy mat, which is the gametophyte. Then these stalks grow out of it, which are sporophytes.

The gametophyte produces a pair of gametes - like sperm and eggs for us - which fuse and become a zygote. The zygote becomes a sporophyte, which produces a bunch of spores, the spores become gametophytes, and the cycle continues.

In any case, genuine metagenesis is not present in any animal groups. There are animals which alternate between asexual and sexual forms, yes, but that doesn’t count.
