Try to get them to bite you in the throat rather than in the stomach. Failing that, hope you’ll go into shock and not feel the pain for what could be 5 minutes or more before you die.

Really, if they attack you - especially in a pack - you have no chance. Spotted hyenas can run at speeds of up to 58 km/h (compare that to Usain Bolt’s 45), and their jaws are powerful enough to crush a human skull like a sparrow’s egg.
