Sloths. I am of the perhaps unpopular opinion that sloths, in general, aren’t cute at all - rather, they’re highly disturbing.

This looks more like a swamp demon than a cute, fuzzy animal. And they do this creepy smile which makes me uncomfortable…

When they get wet, they turn into gaunt, matted creatures which creep, ever so slowly, across the ground in the most terrifying way.

And end up with bowl cuts:

And then of course there’s that video of a pet sloth with a cat…

Plus, sloth biology is kind of disgusting. Their coarse, algae-covered fur is ridden with hundreds of insects which crawl all over them. There are even several species of moths which live exclusively on sloths.

Long story short, I think all sloths are likely intent on entering your house at night and murdering you. Remember, they kill their victims even slower than they move…
