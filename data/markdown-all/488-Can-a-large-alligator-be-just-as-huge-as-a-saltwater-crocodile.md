Yes, absolutely. The largest recorded member of the genus Alligator was shot in where else but Louisiana in 1890. It was approximately 5.85 metres long and 900 kilograms in weight, according to reports.

That was 130 years ago, granted, so there’s no way to objectively verify that these measurements were correct. However, even if we use the largest confirmed alligator, the answer is still yes. The Stokes alligator, shot in 2014, was 4.8 metres long and about half a ton in weight.

In comparison, some adult salties are only 2.3 metres long. Even males can sometimes be no more than 4.3 when fully grown. The Stokes alligator easily beats the minimum adult weight of the saltwater crocodile (80 kg), and is within the mass range of males too.

However, the largest of saltwater crocodiles can be over twice the ‘gator’s size, hence their position as the largest reptile in the world.
