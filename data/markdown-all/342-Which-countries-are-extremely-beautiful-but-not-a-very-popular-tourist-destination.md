Pretty much all of the world’s least visited countries have astounding natural beauty, funnily enough. Here are the fifteen nations which get the least annual international tourists:

*   Nauru, ~300 annual arrivals

As you can see, virtually all countries have their extremely beautiful spots. Some of them, however, are very rarely visited, thanks to poor infrastructure, geographic isolation, or political instability. As a side note, you’d think North Korea would be on this list, but it actually gets around 300,000 tourists yearly, mainly from neighbouring China.

On the topic of the tourism figures I gave, they can very pretty widely from source to source. I got mine from [here](https://passportsymphony.com/least-visited-countries-in-the-world/ "passportsymphony.com"), which seemed fairly professional, although it came with the disclaimer that countries which get low tourism due to armed conflict but would otherwise be popular were excluded.

In any case, take the numbers here with a grain of salt. They might be a bit off, but nevertheless all the countries here are among the world’s least visited, so my point remains.
