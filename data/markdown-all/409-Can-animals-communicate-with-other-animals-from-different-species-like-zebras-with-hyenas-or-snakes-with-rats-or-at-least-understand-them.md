## Can animals communicate with other animals from different species like zebras with hyenas or snakes with rats, or at least understand them?

Quite often, yes - this so-called interspecific communication is known from a number of mammal species. Most of the time, the two different species, usually closely related, recognize each others alarm call, and so both benefit if a predator is spotted by the other.

Some notable examples include sifakas and red-fronted lemurs in Madagascar;

Diana monkeys and Campbell’s monkeys in West Africa;

And yellow-bellied marmots and golden-mantled ground squirrels in the US:

And of course, that’s discounting the countless examples of other animals - from domestic dogs to Koko the gorilla - which communicate with humans.

The latter has a very interesting story; she learned over 1,000 words in American sign language and understood more spoken English words even than that. Alas, it’s too long to tell here, so you can look into it yourself if your interested.
