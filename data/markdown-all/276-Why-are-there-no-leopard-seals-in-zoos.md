Well, because there were no leopard seals in zoos, and these days, zoos don’t collect animals from the wild. And they shouldn’t. Of course, that just shifts the question back in time; why were there no leopard seals in zoos?

Essentially, it’s because they are very hard to obtain. Leopard seals live in the Antarctic, in a harsh environment far from civilization. Yes, there are various Antarctic species in zoos such as emperor and adelie penguins, but penguins are charismatic enough to attract scores of visitors, and thus the effort pays off.

There is one place outside Antarctica where leopard seals occasionally end up - Oceania. When severely injured individuals wash up on the shores of Australia or New Zealand, zoos can legally bring them into captivity, since they’d die otherwise. Thus, all the occurrences of leopard seals in zoos were in this region.

What was once the only leopard seal in captivity - a male called Casey, pictured above - was kept in Sydney’s Taronga Zoo for five years, until it sadly had to be euthanized in 2014. The seal was, for unknown reasons, terribly ill and would not eat.

Casey, along with (if I recall correctly) an individual in some zoo in New Zealand, are the only leopard seals which have been kept in captivity, at least for public viewing. The only scenario in which it would be acceptable - rescuing an injured, washed-up one - is very rare, and thus so are leopard seals in zoos.
