Among extant animals, they are in fact the colugos, also known misnomerically as flying lemurs.

This is an order - named Dermoptera, meaning “skin wings” - of gliding mammals only found in Southeast Asia. There are only two extant species, both in a single family - Cynocephalidae, which means “dog-headed”.

The most wide-ranging of the two species is the Sunda flying lemur, which is found in much of Sundaland (the biogeographical region of Indonesia west of the imaginary Wallace Line). The species pictured above is also of this variety.

Meanwhile in the Philippine archipelago, the second species dwells. The Philippine flying lemur, which the locals refer to as the “kagwang”, is a rich chocolate colour as opposed to its Indonesian relative’s grey. It’s much more poorly understood than the other species, as of yet.

It might seem unusual that these unusual creatures are the closest living relatives of primates, but if you imagine them without their gliding membranes, they do look quite similar to some living prosimians. It’s because of that that they’re often referred to as flying lemurs.
