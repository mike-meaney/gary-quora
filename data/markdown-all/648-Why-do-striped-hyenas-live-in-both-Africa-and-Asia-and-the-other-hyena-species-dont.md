Above is an image of the former range of the spotted hyena subspecies C. c. spelaea, which, as you can see, covers much of Europe and Asia. They have since been wiped out in those areas, probably by humans.

Brown hyenas live in Southern Africa, which is a long ways away from Asia, and their spread northward into those regions is prevented by striped hyenas, which occupy the same niche as them.
