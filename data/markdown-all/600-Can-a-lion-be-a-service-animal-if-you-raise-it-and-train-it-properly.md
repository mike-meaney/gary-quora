Should we do it? No. Will we do it? No.

Could we do it?

Maybe.

I’m afraid I’m going to have to disagree with the other answerers here. If we really, really wanted to, then we could do it.

Meet Kevin Richardson:

Kevin was an exercise physiologist, until he had the opportunity to work at a local lion park, which changed his life forever.

Now, he is a self-taught animal behaviorist and zookeeper, and has broken pretty much every health and safety rule there is when it comes to working with large predators.

Through trust and understanding, he has bonded with a multitude of large predators, especially lions.

Here are a few more pictures to show you how unbelievable his relationship with the predators is:

So, how would we do this with a lion?

Your disabled person must meet this lion at a very, very young age, and over years figure out what makes it happy, sad, and angry, so as to tailor their behavior towards it.

I am by no means saying that we should go and start using lions as service animals. It would be extremely dangerous, require an incredible kind of person, and is quite unnecessary.

However, the amount of time, resources and money put into this would be far better spent in lion conservation.
