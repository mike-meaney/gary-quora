If we’re being technically correct, canine does not refer to the dog family. It refers to a subfamily of that family, Caninae, which is the only one that has survived to the present. There are two extinct subfamilies; Hesperocyoninae (civet-like arboreal primitive dogs) and Borophaginae (the “bone-crushing” dogs).

The largest ever dog was a Borophagine, which - as Jacques points out - is Epicyon haydeni, estimated to have weighed about 136 kilograms. Caninae is further subdivided into three tribes; Canins, Cerdocyonins and Vulpins.

The latter two are mainly fox-like things, so the largest ever canine was probably a Canin too. After some cursory research, the answer is no, unless you count the largest of domestic dogs, of course.

Above is Zorba, a now-deceased English mastiff who weighed 142 kilograms - yes, even heavier than Epicyon.
