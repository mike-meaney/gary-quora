If you mean by domesticating the elephant and harvesting it like cattle, then it’s because sub-Saharan African animals are really hard to domesticate.

Virtually every human species, including Homo sapiens, has evolved in East Africa. In our ancestral times, we lived alongside lions, wildebeest and indeed elephants. And because of this, the species there have become accustomed to our presence and refuse to be domesticated.

You can scroll through Wikipedia’s list of domestic animals, and no fully domestic beast (Except the kind of stupid ones like guineafowl) has ever been domesticated in Africa, except for a few in Egypt, which doesn’t count. It’s also the reason why the many, many attempts to domesticate zebras never really succeeded.

But, if you mean hunting elephants, there’s a reason for that as well - elephants are big, dangerous and really smart, and there’s not really much need to hunt them anyway.

Every year, over 500 people are killed by elephants, and that number’s increasing. People have been gored by 3-metre tusks, crushed under feet that could envelop a small child, and literally picked up by trunks as they run away. A quick Google search yields many images of people being attacked by elephants.

Also, elephants are intelligent. When a member of their herd is killed, they mourn it and perform a burial ritual. And if they found out that some puny hairless ape killed their family member, they would instantly seek revenge.(Their capacity for grief is one of the reasons that I am so opposed to elephant trophy hunting)

“But didn’t primitive humans wipe out mammoths?” I hear you ask. Indeed they did, doubtlessly with fatalities, but that was when the land was bare of more pleasant alternatives, and before the invention of farming. Most modern African tribes today are pastoralists, preferring cattle to wild game, so have no need to hunt gigantic killer beasts.

There’s also one other reason: Elephants are highly respected in many African cultures.

The Mbuti people believe that elephants contain the souls of their dead loved ones. Many other Central African cultures have similar ideas; some think they are reincarnations of their dead chieftains.

Even in African cave art from the Paleolithic, we see many, many depictions of elephants. If you don’t know how animal cave paintings work, it’s thought that the Stone Age people had a “sacred animal hierarchy”, with the higher-ranking members being more respected and drawn on the caves. These animals were usually either great beasts, like woolly rhinos and wild cattle, or fierce predators, like cave lions or saber-toothed cats.

In both African and Asian cultures, elephants often symbolise power, strength, endurance, wisdom, leadership and tenderness.

Thanks for asking this question, it is in fact a very interesting topic to think about (besides the killing elephants part).
