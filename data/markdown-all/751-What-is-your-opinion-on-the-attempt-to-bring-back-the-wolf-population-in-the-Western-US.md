I am not an American, nor am I a rancher, but if I am anything I am someone who knows about wolves.

Personally, I am for the reintroduction of wolves in the United States. Canines have been apex predators in America for over 30 million years, while humans only got there several thousand years ago - and for most of that time, the species co-existed.

I don’t mind people who say they’d shoot wolves if they’re killing their livestock. If a wolf caught you eating its prey, it’d kill you too. The people I don’t like are the people who say that wolves should be wiped out in America. I won’t quote his name, but I do remember a member of an anti-wolf coalition who once said:

“Wolves have never balanced diddly-squat.”

Oh, please. Is that why the ecosystem was doing fine for millions of years before Europeans came to America? Is that why wolves have nearly disappeared from the US since it became a country?

An anti-wolf zoologist, if one existed, I would at least listen to… but I do have a problem with people who believe wolves should be exterminated when their views are clouded by unresearched opinion and human constructs.

Many anti-wolf Americans often use their method of hunting as an argument. This is something that seems horrific to many people because we’ve lost most of our connection with nature, but there are evolutionary reasons for this.

When wolves take down an elk, it may not be dead. The wolves will start to eat it at this point, often starting from the back end. While this does maximize the pain of the prey item, it is simply the way wolves have evolved.

Big cats, for the most part, are stealth hunters - they hide, get close and pounce. This means the prey will be fully fit when they do strike, so they need to crush all struggling quickly. Because of that, they have gained adaptations to kill quickly and less painfully. Retractable claws, flexible forearms and elastic wrists help.

Wolves and hyenas, however, are not built for stealth. They live in social groups, which are good for coordinated pursuits. They do not have the flexible forelegs of a cat, because those legs would be better used running their prey to the ground. And when they do catch up, the prey will be extremely tired, so it will not resist when they begin to feed. They start from the back end because that is where they usually make the incision on a chase (Since they run from behind the animal).

So, I think that people who are against wolves’ reintroduction need to educate themselves and gain an objective view of the natural world. This can really change people’s views. For example, I never really listened to peoples’ rambling about how spotted hyenas are evil and dirty and savage. One day, I decided to learn about hyenas, and I saw their intelligence, and in my opinion, beauty, and now they are one of my favourite animals.
