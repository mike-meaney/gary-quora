## Once, I went jogging and I found myself accompanied by a big black bird with a big red beak, in the late evening. The creature walks in an oddly, scary way. I tried searching for the bird but I don't know what his kind is. What is the species?

It sounds like you’ve come across some kind of moorhen. Moorhens are a type of stout bird in the rail family which live similar lifestyles to ducks and geese. If you live in the Americas, it was probably a common gallinule.

If you live in Australia, then it’d be a dusky moorhen.

And if you’re anywhere else, the culprit is likely a common moorhen, found in much of Europe, Africa and Asia.

The “oddly scary” walk would make sense, as moorhens’ ridiculously large feet mean that they have an unusual gait.

Do these fit the bill?
