## Why do many dinosaurs look like someone just pulled some skin over their bones, while mammals today look fluffy and round?

Because artists are reconstructing dinosaurs the wrong way. Many of them, anyway. It is tempting to look at a fossil skeleton, imagine it with some skin on its bones, and call it a day. Indeed, an artist might not want to add too much extra tissue lest they be accused of being too “speculative”.

But we know that animals just don’t work that way, and speculation is now an important part of modern paleoart. Thus, Tyrannosaurus likely looked a lot more like this:

Than this:

The truth is that there are many aspects of an animal’s appearance - be it body fat, musculature, integument, or other soft tissue features - that bones don’t even hint at. This X-ray of a seal, which I’ve haphazardly edited, is a great illustrator of that fact:

And it’s not just non-avian dinosaurs which get this shrink-wrapping treatment. Look at these poor, anorexic creatures.

Let’s put a little more meat on them…

Much better. Now, this isn’t all to say that shrink-wrapping is never appropriate. By examining an animal’s skull, we can somewhat predict how deeply buried it was in life. Some animals, such as ankylosaurs and stem-tetrapods, seemingly had very bony faces.

However, animals like sauropods, pterosaurs and mosasaurs were clearly “fuller” than they’re too often reconstructed as. In both dinosaurs and mammals, fluffy and round is the way to go.
