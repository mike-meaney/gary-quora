At the moment, there is only one species of cheetah, Acinonyx jubatus. However, there are 4 other extinct species. The most well-known of these is the giant cheetah, Acinonyx pardinensis. This guy lived alongside (And preyed on) ancient humans, and could grow up to the size of a lion.

What was thought to be the most primitive member of the cheetah genus is the Linxia Cheetah, Acinonyx kurteni. They were originally thought to live in the Pliocene epoch, but in 2012, it was discovered that the bone fragments were from the Miocene.

Then there are two other extinct cheetah species which we don’t have much information on: Acinonyx intermedius and Acinonyx aicha.

But, all of those 4 species mentioned are as of now extinct. As said, the only extant species of cheetah is A. jubatus. This species has got 5 subspecies, and we’ll go through them now.

The most numerous and widespread subspecies is the South African cheetah, A. j. jubatus. It lives in southern Africa, with especially high concentrations in countries like Botswana.

Then you’ve got the Asiatic cheetah, A. j. venaticus. This one’s critically endangered, with only a very small population surviving in Iran. It used to range all the way from eastern Turkey to India, but it’s since been extirpated in the 20th century.

Another cheetah subspecies rated CR on the IUCN Red List is the Northwest African cheetah, A. j. hecki. Like its Asian cousin, it used to have a far greater range (In this case spanning the western half of the Sahara.), but has been compromised greatly by human activity. Now it only survives in a couple of pockets in the barren Saharan interior.

The next subspecies is the Northeast African cheetah, A. j. soemmerengii. Inhabiting northeast African nations like South Sudan and Ethiopia, it is thought that the Ancient Egyptians domesticated them for use as hunting animals and pets.

Finally, there’s Acinonyx jubatus raineyii, the East African cheetah. As it’s name suggests, it is found in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Somalia. I’ve had the privilege to see these in the wild, and they’re amazing creatures.

You might also be interested in cheetah colour morphs. You might have heard of the king cheetah, but they can also be pseudo-melanistic, erythristic, isabelline, Maltese, speckled, ticked, melanistic, or albino.
