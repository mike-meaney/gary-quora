Based on maximum size, the harpy eagle is the largest eagle in the world - one massive captive female weighed in at over twelve kg. Wild individuals, however, rarely exceed nine (The lesser-known Steller’s sea eagle is actually the biggest species in the wild).

Nevertheless, a nine kg eagle is one damn formidable predator.

Harpy eagles tend to hunt chiefly in the rainforest canopy, so arboreal mammals - primates and sloths - form the bulk of their prey. Females often go for larger spider monkeys, howler monkeys and full-grown sloths, which can weigh as much as 9 kg. As far as I know, the largest documented harpy eagle prey item was a 10.1 kg crab-eating raccoon.

That being said, it’s worth noting that their food choice is limited not by what they can kill, but what they can carry. The grip strength of their talons and the power of their wings are incredible - they can fly while holding an equally-sized animal in their toes - but finite.

Since we’re just concerned with what a harpy eagle could slay, actual observations of their prey selection might not be the most helpful. Eagles of similar or lesser size have certainly been noted to take down animals weighing more than 10.1 kg.

Take the harpy’s cousin the Philippine eagle, for example. It’s slightly lighter (although longer) and has a very similar ecological role, feeding mainly on primates and other tree-dwelling mammals. On occasion they can kill Philippine deer weighing 14 kg, around twice their body weight!

The eagles we should really be looking at are those who eat their prey on the spot, and don’t need to fly away with their catch. There are reports of African crowned eagles killing bushbuck (up to 30 kg), martial eagles strangling duikers (37 kg) and wedge-tailed eagles hunting red kangaroos (50 kg).

No species, however, is more proficient at punching above its weight than the golden eagle. Believe it or not, in the late ’80s, a golden eagle in New Mexico attacked and killed a 110 kg cow, more than eleven times its size! This is the largest animal ever killed by an extant bird, by far.

Could a harpy eagle, in theory, pull off such a feat? I, for one, would say so.

In the wild, harpies are usually significantly larger than goldens, and furthermore the bird that killed that cow was in North America, meaning it probably wasn’t as big as the golden eagles in Eurasia get - those in Tibet and the Himalayas in particular are huge. Additionally, the grip strength of harpy eagle talons has been measured much higher than that of golden eagles’.

So, to answer your question, I think it’s entirely possible that a large female harpy eagle could kill an animal weighing over 100 kg, perhaps well over.
