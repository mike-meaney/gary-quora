The same reason that snakes have forked tongues.

Particles picked up by the chemoreceptors on the right prong of the fork rather than the left indicate that the source of the smell is to the right.

Nostrils work in a similar way - particles received by the right nostril’s sensors also indicate that the odor’s source is on the right.
