Most people would answer the 1958 megatsunami of Lituya Bay, Alaska, which was a staggering 545 metres tall. Yes, this one was the biggest in recorded history, but the actual tallest tsunami probably occurred a long, long time ago.

When a 14 kilometre-wide bolide hit the Gulf of Mexico 65.5 million years ago, the impact sent tsunamis radiating across the surrounding sea.

According to the latest simulations, the initial tidal wave caused by the asteroid would have been an unbelievable 1.5 kilometres tall, nearly three times taller than the Lituya Bay tsunami!

However, this megatsunami would have likely shrunk as it approached the shore to 14 metres in height. This is because the Chixculub bolide hit relatively shallow water - had it impacted open ocean, it might have produced a 4.6 kilometre waveâ€¦
