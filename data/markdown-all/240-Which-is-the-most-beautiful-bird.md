There are over 10,000 living bird species in this world to choose from, and truth be told all of them are beautiful. In choosing just one favourite, I must ignore countless other worthy candidates. My choice, surprisingly, is not a super-obscure species from some far-flung jungle, but rather one much more familiar to me: the Mandarin duck.

As its name suggests, this bird originates from Asia, being native to eastern China, Taiwan, the Korean Peninsula, Japan, and parts of the Russian Far East. I don’t live in any of those places, but the Mandarin duck is nevertheless a common enough sight nearby my neighbourhood.

That’s because it has long been a popular species for menageries, and in many parts of the Western World, ducks have escaped from captivity and established themselves in local parks. Populations have sprung up in Bavaria, Berlin, Belgium, Britain and my own brilliant birthplace, Ireland. They make a refreshingly exotic change from the usual local birdlife!

Mandarin drakes (males, that is) are nothing short of breathtaking, painted with shades of white, black, green, blue, purple, red, orange and gold. Prominent features such as a pair of huge “sails” on the back and brightly coloured cheek frills make them attractive suitors to their female counterparts.

Speaking of which, the females are significantly less flamboyant, as you’d expect. They sport mostly grey hues, and are a little smaller too. Here’s a side-by-side comparison:

The mated couple pictured above will likely stay together for life. Mandarin ducks are famously faithful; the vast majority of other ducks switch partners every year. Because of this, they are a symbol of fidelity and lifelong marriage in traditional Chinese, Korean and Japanese culture.

In South Korea, newlyweds are commonly presented with won-ang seteu, or “wedding ducks”, as marriage gifts. These are wooden carvings of Mandarin ducks, given as a representation of the conjugal harmony to come.

While the Mandarin duck might not have the most intense and vibrant plumage in all the bird world, to me it is the most beautiful feathered friend because of its pleasing palette of colours and delicate form. And, what's more, it carries a heartwarming cultural significance.

Thank you very much for reading, everybody, and have a great day.
