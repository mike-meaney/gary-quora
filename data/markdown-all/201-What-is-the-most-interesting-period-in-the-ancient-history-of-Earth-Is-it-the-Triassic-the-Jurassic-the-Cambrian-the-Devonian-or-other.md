It’s like choosing a favourite child, honestly, but I think I’ll go with the Triassic for today. This period started about 251 million years ago, immediately preceded by the infamous End-Permian Extinction - the most devastating extinction event in Earth’s history.

The cause of this mass extinction, also known as the Great Dying, is debated, but we do know it was immensely lethal. It’s thought that nearly 60% of all biological families were wiped out, including 70% of the world’s land vertebrate species. What this means is that, entering the Triassic, evolution practically had a clean slate to experiment with.

You see, with an uncountable number of niches in the ecosystem left vacant, the descendants of the survivors were able to diversify at an unprecedented rate, often evolving bizarre anatomies.

In the Permian, therapsids (relatives of mammals) were the dominant group of land animals, but after the extinction, they were replaced by the archosauriforms - distant reptilian cousins of today’s crocodiles and birds. Most of them were not dinosaurs, but were equally fascinating. As they radiated into countless forms, they produced some pretty bizarre species.

*   This includes Erythrosuchus, which had a gigantic, bone-crushing head; proportionally, the largest of any known land vertebrate, extinct or otherwise.

*   Triopticus, which evolved a solid dome of thick bone at the front of its skull, probably used for ramming competitors in territorial disputes.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-99a15051a23170e5bf02ea1227b91813-lq)

*   Scleromochlus, a cross between a lizard and a kangaroo. Its back legs were long and springy, enabling it to move around by hopping.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eb6575545c5dda8aa03249a171ec5d1f-pjlq)

*   Teraterpeton, which - for some reason - had a beak. The front half of its long, tapering snout had no teeth, an adaptation which we can’t yet explain.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-309e9d40764e91dc41dfc7cb3b2f2bb0-pjlq)

*   Hyperodapedon, another beaked critter. This one, however, had a short keratinous beak at the end of its head, as well as a broad skull to accomodate huge jaw muscles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-aa3b6ef0d66f6ec592fdd7faec74a271-lq)

*   Vancleavea, a heavily-armoured reptile which lived a semi-aquatic lifestyle. Coated head-to-toe in bony plates, it also sported a weird arrangement of teeth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b1a662319e2fcaab8db48b38a048ceae-lq)

*   Shringasaurus, a barrel-chested herbivore which had a long neck and a pair of curved horns, probably for combat.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-88f2e2bf1adbdc085777d47351662716)

*   Tanystropheus, a bizarre, 6 metre long creature whose neck was longer than its body and tail combined. It was adapted to feed on fast-moving aquatic prey like fish and squid.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3e1610f29a0c6cdbfcca2392b7882ae4-lq)

What’s interesting about the archosauriforms of this time is that many of them were members of the group Suchia, which includes modern crocodylians. For parts of the Triassic, the land was essentially dominated by massive pseudo-crocodiles, such as:

*   Postosuchus, an apex predator of its time. It weighed up to 300 kg and was probably at least partially bipedal, moving around on two legs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eadf16039759028bd62c3d695f3d3e56-pjlq)

*   Carnufex, which was somewhat smaller, but even more specialized for bipedal movement. It was discovered in just 2015.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c6685ee44771cb9dbc5a4650297d1010-lq)

*   Terrestrisuchus, a tiny critter which was basically the anatomical opposite of today’s crocodylians. Its legs were long and slim, standing directly below the body rather than sprawling out to the side. It would have been an agile hunter which fed on insects and the like.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f96396d94f680f8b7d6414e49901b01d-lq)

*   Desmatosuchus, a herbivore built like a tank. It bore a striking resemblance to the ankylosaurs, dinosaurs which only evolved long after this reptile went extinct.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ab38cda8e92e505467ef8aa546203539-pjlq)

*   Effigia, another remarkably dinosaur-like suchian. It bears a striking resemblance to the ornithomimosaurs (“ostrich mimics”) of the Cretaceous.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d1a60100475cc38e7ecdc43155a566f5-lq)

*   Lotosaurus, a big herbivore with a tall sail running down its back and a short beak instead of teeth. Again, one could draw comparisons with true dinosaurs, stegosaurs in particular.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-00a4efcb3223daa201c81d630ef73661-lq)

As you can see, the pseudo-crocodiles of the Triassic were everything but what today’s crocodiles are. That niche was instead occupied by outlandish animals called phytosaurs, such as Rutiodon and Redondasaurus. They were true monsters, growing over six metres in length.

Though they resembled modern crocodilians, they are only distantly related, being distinguished by the position of the nostrils close to the eyes and their heavier armouring.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-76f5ebd5114193600abaae8f4e2868f3-lq)

The Triassic was also the period in which marine reptiles first became successful. There were the mesosaurs in the Permian beforehand, but they only had a few species and weren’t very specialized.

Some of the species in this great radiation of aquatic reptiles were bizarre, such as:

*   Atopodentatus, a hilariously odd creature which had a flat, hammer-shaped head. It used this to sieve through the sediment, like an underwater vacuum cleaner.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0bcbc0cee7b45337a3292628a4230889-lq)

*   Placodus, an animal of a most rotund build, equipped with powerful jaws to crush tough shellfish on the seafloor.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2d7e26a795f5c38936dbd6e1fb0f3719-pjlq)

*   Helveticosaurus, which reminds me of a cross between a seal and a turtle. It had a very small head, two pairs of long flippers and a paddle-shaped tail.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9361d9cb809dee9439f34457c4cf352d-lq)

*   Thalattosaurus, a slender, lizard-like animal with a long snout. Its weirdest feature would probably be the bony projections in its skull which acted as pseudo-teeth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-382fd03f93c146bb7e992d840e0bd7cf-pjlq)

*   Odontochelys, an amazing evolutionary link between turtles and other reptiles. It only had the bottom portion of the modern turtle shell, and its ribs had started to broaden out. It also hadn’t yet evolved a beak, still having teeth instead.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0e1318e531b9a28e5aa884482ed655c7-lq)

*   The as of yet unnamed Lilstock Ichthyosaur. Discovered in 2018, this species may have been the largest reptile of all time, measuring a staggering 26 metres in length. Some argue it could even be comparable in size to the modern blue whale, but the evidence of this is shaky.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ed7a3e7c81a9bfb4f0617adbb8d49f17-pjlq)

*   Nothosaurus, a slender semi-aquatic predator with a long, serpentine neck and huge, needle-like teeth for snagging onto slippery prey.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f0f7c15cdbe8df986a3f936897bed9a7-pjlq)

*   Hupehsuchus, an armoured creature which - in light of 2015 research - was likely a lunge feeder, similar to grey whales, that had an elastic, pelican-like throat pouch. It would have thrust itself (“lunged”) into the seabed and sieved through the silt for food.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-256334e4d8109043a7aa1163edc03319-lq)

*   Eretmorhipis, which was arguably even wackier than any of the aforementioned marine reptiles. It had a flat duck-bill and tiny eyes, like a platypus, and a row of bony plates along its spine.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0c7f3d23a9d326d89582319b71fa6483-lq)

I should also mention that, in the Triassic, reptiles came to dominate not only the land and seas but the skies too; the pterosaurs evolved during this time.

The first ever flying vertebrates, Triassic pterosaurs were much less streamlined and specialized than their descendants, with long tails and heavy heads. The largest species was Caelestiventus, at a wingspan of 1.5 metres.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-21b372216e7f5ea813b7f0317bf24607-lq)

Anyway, before I move on, there are some other reptiles which definitely deserve a mention…

*   Drepanosaurus, which was almost like a reptilian primate. It dwelled in the trees, and had a prehensile tail tipped with a keratinous hook. Each of its forelimbs had an oversized toe, too, used to grip branches.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3b69dadc578e4e5cc3ba02d881745c28-pjlq)

*   Kuehneosaurus, one of the first ever gliding animals. Similar to a modern draco lizard, it had huge ribs which it would use to glide from tree to tree.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-af696499664ee9e11ade0db9ef0e50b1-pjlq)

*   Sharovipteryx, an even weirder glider. Whereas most gliding animals have wing membranes attached to their arms, Sharovipteryx’ was stretched across its legs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a60714e9eddc7ee5016642d937406cbb-lq)

*   Longisquama, a lizard-like creature with a line of incredibly long scales protruding from its back, likely used for display.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b2cd367b247bf968a86b6135e82158bb-lq)

*   Hypsognathus, a small, squat herbivore with a face only a mother could love. It had an array of downward-facing spikes for defense.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-191bc146b82750fccf48901461158818-lq)

Of course, the Triassic was also the period when the dinosaurs first evolved. By the end of it, they dominated the land. That being said, in my opinion the dinosaurs of the Triassic are much less interesting than those that would come after, so I’m sort of brushing over them here.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-064e983ab0dbbdb0494063b4250bf797-lq)

Understandably, when talking about the Triassic, the reptiles tend to take the spotlight. However, there were many other fascinating species around during this time. First of all, there were the synapsids - mammals and their relatives - such as:

*   Lisowicia, the largest non-mammalian synapsid of all time. This brute of a herbivore, belonging to the dicynodonts, may have weighed up to 6,000 kg - comparable to an elephant. It was first documented in only 2018.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cabf2ebf8ea8078030f6ff42526b6064-lq)

*   Lystrosaurus, another dicynodont. Fascinatingly, it evolved in the Permian, but survived the Great Dying. After the extinction, there was an explosion in Lystrosaurus population, and they became the most numerous animals on the planet.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5e8288494a4295a98d2476a3427d257f-lq)

*   Moschorhinus, another survivor of the mass extinction. It was perhaps the largest carnivorous synapsid of the Triassic, being about as big as a lion.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-150eb92bb04fc9c42fadcf680fa2a41c-lq)

There were several amazing amphibians too, although this group was in decline by the Triassic, having seen its heyday in the Paleozoic Era. I feel I should include:

*   Triadobatrachus, another great transitional fossil. It’s the oldest member of the frog lineage known, and still retains many characteristics of other amphibians, such as a short tail.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8d36a1f00804368ba89e521b4ec02945-lq)

*   Trematosaurus, which was basically an amphibian crocodile. Two to three metres long, it had a long snout full of needle-like teeth and a pair of eyes high on the top of its head. Oh, and it lived in the ocean, not freshwater!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f6e5f57d17f14091ed85358d1fc3f589-lq)

*   Mastodonsaurus, a relative of Trematosaurus which was likely twice its size. It had a massive triangular head, and would have been an aquatic ambush predator of unsuspecting land animals.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5750b7b55c3817073c33968e5bcda9d8-lq)

*   Gerrothorax, an incredibly bizarre creature. Flat as a pancake, it would have hidden on riverbeds, its upward-facing eyes watching for prey. When a victim approached, its jaw would open upwards and create a huge suction force through its gills (yes, it had gills).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-28e11765ba454b63ea5fdb5b74a65a1d-pjlq)

There were also plenty of incredible species in the oceans, too, besides the marine reptiles mentioned earlier. Allow me to introduce you to:

*   Rebellatrix, a species of coelacanth. In contrast to the sluggish coelacanths of today, Rebellatrix was unique in that it was an agile predator, occupying a niche formerly filled by sharks.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-36446f10b57e659baf14c764e67fd4b7-lq)

*   Foreyia, another coelacanth. Its massive head had a pointy, shield-like crest, a curved beak and a pronounced underbite. Truly a bizarrely shaped fish.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-27093d9af87ad18e37c0b25420ac6af8-lq)

*   Vaderlimulus, a horseshoe crab which was so named because its strangely-shaped carapace resembles the helmet of Darth Vader.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1cb4ee673c0ca842d82eb6d179e0a1ff-lq)

*   Bellerophon, a species of sea snail. There’s nothing that interesting about it outwardly, but what makes it so fascinating is that it evolved more than 440 million years ago, and was still around in the Triassic, over 200 million years later. For a genus to be that long-lived is incredible.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5bf9d978715e3e9482be3417c759e87c-pjlq)

*   Ceratodus, a lungfish which, again, isn’t that unique anatomically. However, it’s notable for being incredibly wide-ranging, found on every single continent, and incredibly long-lived; it evolved in the Early Triassic, and died out 200 million years later, even surviving the K-Pg Extinction.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d17fd4ff8e6d55795ce29014bcd172f3-lq)

*   Thoracopterus. It looked almost exactly like a modern flying fish, with huge fins used for gliding above the surface, but evolved entirely independent of them.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-85a19cee368d9ca3acda2e261e7b0e50-pjlq)

*   Xenacanthus, one of the only freshwater sharks known. Serpentine in shape, it was up to 2 metres long and had a (possibly venomous!) spine on its back. Its powerful jaws were built for crushing shellfish.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3939a817dd498c57518446116a7e8fa1-lq)

*   Saurichthys, a torpedo-shaped predatory fish with a sharp, elongated snout. Based on fossil evidence, it commonly engaged in cannibalism, and even sometimes fed on pterosaurs or marine reptiles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d22df923e44e90f8976afc680f9895e0-pjlq)

Last but not least, I want to give an honourable mention to a one of the arthropods from the Triassic - Gigatitan. It was related to grasshoppers, but had grabbing forelimbs like a praying mantis - and it was the size of a bird.

Gigatitan was probably the last of the truly giant insects which first appeared in the Carboniferous, but were outcompeted by flying vertebrates (pterosaurs in this case). Interestingly enough, oxygen levels in the Triassic were incredibly low, around 12%. Gigatitan’s existence would seem to discredit the idea that oxygen creates giant bugs.

Anyone still reading? Hopefully the nice pictures were enough to drag at least some of you through this monstrous answer.

Long story short, the Triassic is so interesting because it was a transitional time when it was very much the age of reptiles, but not quite yet the age of dinosaurs. Add in the chaotic evolutionary weirdness following the Permian Extinction and you get one hell of a time period.
