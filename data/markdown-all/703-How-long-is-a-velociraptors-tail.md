An average Velociraptor mongoliensis was about as long as a human is tall, 1.8m.

In this diagram, you can see that the tail takes up about two thirds of the dromaeosaur’s body length:

So, since the full body length is 1.8 metres, I’d estimate the tail to be 1 - 1.2 metres long, roughly.

That’s a pretty long tail. In case you were wondering why its tail is so long, it’s probably for balance. Velociraptor was a cursorial animal and would have chased its prey with high speed.

Balance is important for sprinting and climbing, and a lot of cursorial/arboreal modern animals have long tails for that very purpose.
