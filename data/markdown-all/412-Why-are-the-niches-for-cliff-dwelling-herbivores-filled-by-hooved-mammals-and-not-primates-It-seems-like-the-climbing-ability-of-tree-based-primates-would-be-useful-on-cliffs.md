## Why are the niches for cliff-dwelling herbivores filled by hooved mammals and not primates? It seems like the climbing ability of tree-based primates would be useful on cliffs.

Ooh, an intelligent question. I like these.

First of all, there are actually primates which fill such a niche, like geladas. Geladas, Theropithecus gelada, live in the cliffs of the Ethiopian Highlands and are primarily herbivorous, eating the mountain grass.

However, they’re in the baboon lineage - a clade which is specialized for terrestrial locomotion, not arboreal. That brings us to the answer to your question; climbing adaptations are not necessarily useful for this kind of lifestyle.

Let’s look at an ibex, for example, an ungulate which fills the niche you describe.

The main reasons they’re so successful on cliffsides is that they’re 1) agile, and 2) their hooves are really strong. Neither of those are necessarily primate specializations, so it’s to be expected that the dominant herbivore group, ungulates, would occupy this role.
