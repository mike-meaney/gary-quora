You’re probably thinking of the pachycephalosaurs. This suborder of dinosaurs, closely related to ceratopsians like Triceratops, contained some 16 known species which emerged around 90 million years ago and went extinct at the end of the Mesozoic, roughly 65.5 million years ago.

“Pachycephalosaur” itself means thick-headed lizard, in reference to their heavily ossified heads which came in a variety of shapes: domed, flattish or wedge-shaped, and were surrounded by spikes and knobs.

As you said, they were probably used in head-butting matches like those of mountain goats, although this has been heavily debated - some say that the heads couldn’t withstand the trauma, and were for species recognition instead.

Pachycephalosaurs lived only on the continent of Laurasia (what is now North America, Europe and most of Asia), with the best known, as well as the largest and one of the last, species being Pachycephalosaurus wyomingensis.

All currently known species fall into one family, Pachycephalosauridae. All but one, that is - Wannanosaurus yansiensis, from China, has yet to be assigned a family, and is considered the most primitive of the pachycephalosaurs. It lacks a domed head and its skull has large holes in it, meaning it probably wasn’t very robust.

I should also mention another species, Micropachycephalosaurus hongtuyanensis. Despite being one of the smallest non-avian dinosaurs, it has the longest name of any dinosaur, at 36 letters. It also lived in China, although about 11 million years after Wannanosaurus did.

If I’m to stay true to my scientific principles, there is also another answer. It’s definitely not the one you had in mind, but it is a dinosaur, it is bipedal, and it has a very thick skull used for ramming. I’m talking about the helmeted hornbill.

This fascinating bird is native to Southeast Asia, and is unique among the hornbills. Many of the other species in the family have hollow structures called casques atop their beaks, used to amplify their calls. However, the helmeted hornbill’s casque has evolved into a solid block with a thick bony core.

The primary purpose of this is for head-to-head combat, mid-air, between males, which is pretty damn cool. The battering ram of a head, which accounts for about 11% of the bird’s weight, can both absorb and deliver trauma.

Unfortunately, the keratinous covering of the casque is extremely prized by Chinese and Japanese craftsmen, who carve things into it. Because of this, about 6,000 helmeted hornbills are shot by poachers yearly. In fact, the substance is known as red ivory, and is even more valuable than actual ivory, from elephants.

Because of illegal hunting (as well habitat loss to oil palm plantations, to make matters worse), this bird is listed as critically endangered. It’d be tragic to lose the helmeted hornbill, the planet’s very own modern pachycephalosaur - with wings.
