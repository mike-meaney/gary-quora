Leopards and cheetahs are both members of the family Felidae, which includes all cats. The cat family can be broken down further into two subfamilies - the conical-tooth cats (Modern big cats) and the Machairodontines (Saber-tooth cats.)

Cheetahs and leopards are both part of the conical-toothed variety. This is where their taxonomic classification splits, however. Cheetahs are part of the Felinae tribe, and leopards belong to the Pantherinae tribe.

I know this can be kind of confusing to grasp from just text, so here’s a diagram to help you:

The leopard’s there at the bottom, in the Panthera branch, while the cheetah resides next to the puma around the middle. This diagram only shows extant cats, so it doesn’t give you the whole picture with the subfamilies and tribes I mentioned earlier.

So, those are the phylogenic similarities and differences between the two cats, but if you’d like a less rigorously scientific answer then there are a few more things they share.

All big cats share a similar coat pattern, at least roughly. All of them have markings, be it spots, stripes, rosettes or patches, though some disappear with age (Lion and puma cubs have markings, but they lose them when they grow up. On the contrary, cheetah cubs have very faded markings which become more defined later in life.), and all have yellow-ish fur, which may vary from orange to gold to tan to brown.

Cheetahs and leopards have a very similar coat pattern, so much so that many people can’t tell the difference. Both of their coats are true yellow, with black spots of some form. Since the genes required to create these patterns are very similar, cheetahs and leopards also experience many of the same [aberrant colour morphs](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/22/71/032271b4a309dddfd0453fff894752e2.jpg "i.pinimg.com").

For example, you may have heard of the king cheetah:

But did you know that leopards have a very similar mutation called “pseudo-melanism”?

Lastly, one more thing they have in common is their habitat. Leopards and cheetahs both inhabit Sub-Saharan Africa, though the latter species’ range has suffered greatly in the past few thousand years (Competition from prehistoric big cats nearly decimated cheetah populations - it is only by chance that they are still with us today.). Leopards, on the other hand, are phenomenally adaptable, and conquered Sub-Saharan Africa, then moved through the Middle East into Southern Asia, reaching China and splitting south (To Indonesia) and north (To Russia). There is a small cheetah population on the coast of the Caspian Sea, but that cheetah subspecies is now critically endangered.
