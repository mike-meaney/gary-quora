## If you could put any dinosaur on a horror movie, which one would it be? Mine would be a Spinosaurus or raptors.

If you don’t mind me bending the rules a bit and choosing an animal that’s not a dinosaur, but did exist during the Mesozoic, I’d have to go with azhdarchids.

Imagine a full-size giraffe, but with the head of a stork, a pair of wings spanning the length of a bus, and an appetite for meat. That would be a fair description of these prehistoric monstrosities.

Azhdarchidae was a family of pterosaurs which dominated the skies of the Late Cretaceous world. Named after the Azhdaha, a dragon of Persian legend, they are the largest flying animals ever to exist - one unnamed specimen from Transylvania, nicknamed Dracula, has an estimated wingspan of 12–20 metres.

The larger species in this family are just so horrifically outlandish that they fit the natural horror genre to perfection. Imagine the movie monster - gaunt and lanky, standing over five metres tall, with an enormous dagger-like bill.

There are three confirmed species which were truly giant, likely with wingspans of 10 metres or more. They are Quetzalcoatlus, the most well-known member of the family:

Hatzegopteryx, a bulkier predator which actually dwarfed the dinosaurs it lived amongst:

And Arambourgania, which stood as tall as a giraffe. Its absurd neck measured three metres in length, meaning that aside from the sauropod dinosaurs, it was probably the longest-necked animal ever.

And then, of course, there’s the fact that these massive creatures could fly. Due to their size, they likely would have spend much of their time walking and wading, but have made long-distance flights every now and then - which surely would have been spectacular.

To take off, the giant azhdarchids used their powerful forelimbs in a vaulting motion to launch themselves into the air, wherein they would have flapped to sufficient altitude and began soaring. It’s been estimated that a soaring Quetzalcoatlus could reach speeds of 90 km/h.

As for their diet, they would have been opportunistic carnivores, foraging on the ground for smaller animals to skewer with their huge beaks. It’s quite possible that they fed on small dinosaurs - even juvenile sauropods.

So, I don’t know about you, but if I was a character in a horror movie, the last thing I’d want to be stalked by in a dark forest would be a quarter-ton predator three times my height, with a beak longer than a spear and the ability to fly.
