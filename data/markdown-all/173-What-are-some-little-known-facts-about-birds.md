*   You know how you can move your lower jaw (mandible) down, but never your upper jaw (maxilla) up? This is the case for almost all jawed vertebrates… except flamingos. Because they feed upside down, their beaks are structured “upside down”, with the upper jaw mobile instead.

*   Kiwi birds are flightless, and thus vulnerable to predators. So, they’ve evolved to have newborn chicks which are well-developed, rather than naked and blind. However, that means they’ll be bigger, so you need a bigger egg. A much bigger egg…

*   Crows in New Caledonia can manufacture complex tools out of twigs, grass, ferns, feathers and thorns, trimming and folding wherever necessary. Different “cultures” on different parts of the island use different shaped tools - the only known non-mammal example of cultural evolution.

*   Early penguins first appeared only a few million years after the K-Pg dinosaur extinction event. They looked much like modern loons, only that they were flightless and had short wings already adapted for deep diving.

*   About 37 million years ago in Antarctica, there lived the “Colossus penguin”, which was twice as tall as a modern emperor. Furthermore, they lived alongside huge albatross-like birds with 5-metre wingspans and serrated “teeth” on their beaks; the pelagornithids.

*   As little as 10,000 years ago, Jamaica had some fascinating birdlife. There was Xenicibis, an ibis with fricking clubs on its wings, which may have weighed it down so much that it was a facultative quadruped. There was also the giant caracara, a [caracara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caracara "en.wikipedia.org") as big as a condor, which may have preyed on large deer.

*   There are currently two bird species which have independently evolved echolocation; oilbirds (pictured) and cave swiftlets. The only other animals which can do this are cetaceans, bats, and (as [fascinating discoveries](http://www.lapshin.iitp.ru/lapsh98e.pdf "www.lapshin.iitp.ru") have unveiled) some moths!

*   You probably know that peregrine falcons are fast - they can fly at a breakneck 390 km/h. However, for comparison, you may not know that that’s approaching twice the speed an average human (myelinated) neuron can fire.

*   The hoatzin is a strange bird - it’s one of the only ones which eats mainly leaves. Cellulose is a tricky thing to digest, and the fermenting plant matter in its stomach gives it the nickname of “stinkbird”. However, what’s most interesting about it is that its chicks retain little claws on their wings, like the earliest avian ancestors.

*   Butcher birds are among the world’s most macabre creatures. There are two unrelated kinds; shrikes, and Australian “true” butcherbirds. They’re the only living non-raptors which have evolved tomial teeth (serrations in the beak). The males - as a display of their hunting prowess - like to festoon local thorn bushes with the impaled carcasses of their prey.

*   Many birds are not colored not by pigmentation, but by the structure of their feathers. The feathers of bee-eaters, peacocks, and birds of paradise (to name a few), are covered in microscopic nanostructures, from gratings to crystals to mirrors to fibres to matrices of channels, which bend and split light in such a way as to produce the desired color.

*   The marabou stork is an ugly bird, found all over sub-Saharan Africa. They compete with vultures as avian scavengers, having a bald head that wouldn’t get clotted with blood like a feathery one - they’ll also eat feces and metal scraps. There used to be enormous marabou storks in Indonesia which coexisted with dwarf men and pygmy elephants.

*   Archaeopteryx is an iconic link in the evolution of bird flight. However, some paleontologists argue that it could not fly - but its ancestors could. If this was true it’d make Archie the oldest known secondarily flightless bird.

*   A close relative of the aforementioned marabou stork, wood storks also got the short end of the cosmetic stick. Their bald heads have so much keratin in them that the skin is all grey and scaly, giving them the local nicknames of “flinthead”, “stonehead” and “ironhead”.

*   Potoos are both fascinating and terrifying. Perfectly camouflaged to look like tree bark, their mouths are disproportionately large; as are their eyes. Their pupils can dilate so much that they take up the whole visible portion of their eyes, and they sound… demonic; [Great Potoo (Nyctibius grandis) Call](https://www.hbw.com/ibc/sound/great-potoo-nyctibius-grandis/call "www.hbw.com")

Well, that’s all I can think of for now. Hope these were of interest.
