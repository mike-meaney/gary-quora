In Africa, rhinoceroses are what’s called keystone species - they are crucial for the upholding of the ecosystem. Technically, all species are important ecologically, as the removal of one causes change, and for life - change is bad. However, a keystone species is one which stands out as playing a vital role.

White rhinoceroses

Grassland habitats are fundamentally lacking in nutrients, at least in the soil. That’s one of the reasons why they don’t subside to forest. Some animals, like wildebeest, eat the long, nutrient-poor grass and rely on their powerful digestive systems to process the vegetation.

In contrast, other animals like gazelles eat “sweet grass”, the most nutrient-rich of savannah grasses. In order for any viable concentration of sweet grass to exist in a certain place, there must be a reasonably dense nutrient content in the soil. One of the prime factors which recycles broken-down nutrients into the ground is dung - however, there is usually not enough of it in one place.

White rhino midden

However, rhinos are known for defecating in middens - preset sites where all dung is deposited. These exist for the purpose of being regular, fixed stations where other rhinos can gather information about their peers, but also have the consequence of putting a lot of nutrients into the soil in one place - perfect for sweet grass.

This habit of creating middens is something not seen in black rhinos, which are the less endangered of Africa’s two rhinoceros species. Rhinos are as important to the African savannah ecosystem as any animal, more so in fact, and are - additionally - great for the economy by drawing in tourists, and fundamentally deserve the right to live in the first place.

## Why Felines Have Bigger Canines Than Canines

Most of today’s large, land-dwelling carnivores can be divided into two categories: the cursorial (running) pack hunters and the solitary ambush predators. It would seem that, for mammals at least, these are the two most efficient survival strategies, because several groups have independently evolved to fall squarely into each category.

All canines which are macropredatory (they eat very big animals, that is) subscribe to the former lifestyle. To be specific, that means the grey wolf:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5fc67ee4b464633e1f2c235ae29cfeb9)

The dhole:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-08b1d442dee0927e17f4f029ab4a309b)

The African wild dog:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b623dfcc08e9f1277732d1a3eaff7bd2-lq)

The wonderful yet underappreciated bush dog:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1547aed96913b40cf5561054f43ebb7b-lq)

And the dingo (as well as it’s little-known relative, the New Guinea singing dog):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-acb9f0f2f596fce15404eddf8c3cf8ee-lq)

They’re not the only members of the category, however. Despite being more closely related to felines, hyenas very much exemplify this hunting strategy - the spotted hyena in particular.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-162c25da9f0ee1284dbd1ebb886fcf9b-lq)

All of the animals above work together in packs in order to bring down prey much larger than themselves. Because each individual is small (in comparison to the quarry), overpowering prey through brute strength is unfeasible. Instead, they must use superior endurance to run victims into the ground.

This is reflected in their anatomy. The legs are very slim, and the claws are big and blunt in order to provide traction during a long-distance pursuit. The wrists are stiff and immobile, preventing any joint stress that might come with the repetitive impacts of running. The forelegs also tend to be a little longer than the hindlegs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bf52f9daa0222a6b70ac163972944fc1-pjlq)

Long, unbroken pursuits are most viable in open environments, and as such these carnivores typically inhabit savannahs and grasslands. The air carries scents well in these landscapes, so they always have acute senses of smell - hence the elongated, or telocephalic, snout.

Another factor at play is the fact that, once an animal has been chased to the point of total exhaustion, it’s not going anywhere. Thus, pack-hunting carnivores are in no rush to actually kill their prey - they can just start eating and let it die slowly.

To capitalize on this macabre advantage, their carnassial teeth (at the back of the mouth, equivalent to our molars) are usually huge, adapted for crushing through meat, sinew and even bone. In spotted hyenas, the carnassials are almost comically out of proportion!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-85ccdcba79e3f496c867316146f4ed88-lq)

Now, let’s discuss the second hunting strategy: solitary ambush predation. While the textbook examples of the former category are canines, the most obvious exemplars of this one are felines. Big cats, to be more specific.

That includes the tiger:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b6e09585994ace744c3d11ad9efcaad-lq)

The leopard:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0bf8ae61e49731c2ccf574390affbd44-lq)

The jaguar:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-994a7f5f25457e0bccef4cc07361c849-lq)

The snow leopard:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b22023738282615f166747d65f489941-lq)

The two species of clouded leopard:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7cd7d283f1151b5a1f456953a7dbe763-lq)

And the puma:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c8dbfe620f7f1084233aaa6702c34b53-lq)

Lions are an interesting case, since they live the lifestyle of a pack-hunting predator, but only evolved this behaviour very recently. Anatomically, they still have most of the hallmarks of ambush predators.

Cheetahs are somewhere in between the two - they have many characteristics typical of pack-hunters (males even hunt in cooperative groups called coalitions), but also a few of their feline relatives, and they tend to use agility as their weapon of choice, rather than stamina.

Anyway, there are a handful of other members of the ambush predator classification, such as the polar bear.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-319eed3289b6d4b7515e9f9ff1a95ba9-lq)

As said, all of these animals lead solitary lives. This has resulted in most of them being much larger than animals which hunt in packs - in order to tackle very large targets, they have to carry muscle mass equivalent to that of several small predators.

Rather than running down their prey, they sneak up on it, getting in as close as possible unnoticed before pouncing. Most, but not all, live in forested ecosystems, where the dense vegetation can conceal their approach.

Since they don’t have the luxury of finding their victims in a state of exhaustion, ambush predators must be extremely efficient killers. The legs are thickly muscled, with the back pair being longer than the front pair, in order to produce a powerful lunge. The wrists are very flexible, able to grasp the prey, and the razor-sharp claws are retractible, ensuring that the ground does not dull them.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-865563878c6dfedcc7fbfea8e6f356ea-lq)

The dentition is also very different to what you would see in a cursorial pack-hunting predator. Rather than the carnassials, it is the fangs that are absurdly enlarged, as they are used to deliver that lightning-fast fatal bite. Yes, ironically, felines have bigger canines than canines.

This trait is most pronounced in the clouded leopards. Relative to their size, they have the largest canines of any cat, being almost comparable to the saber-tooths of old.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-23c0663e46c3d1faaf43a91136a0b43e-lq)

The snout is also brachycephalic (shortened, in other words), a feature which maximizes bite force. This tends to compromise the sense of smell, so the sense of hearing is often much more developed. Good hearing also lends itself well to the forest landscape.

* * *

So, that was my incredibly long-winded and digressive way of answering your very simple question. Hopefully some of you found my rambles interesting. If you didn’t want to read all that, here’s a straight answer: canines hunt in packs, so they don’t have to individually match the physical strength of the solitary felines. Thank you for reading, have a great day.

## The Wolf, the Apple and the Ant Colony

One of the most iconic animals which inhabits the dry grasslands of Southern Brazil is the maned wolf, Chrysocyon brachyurus. Of all the extant dogs, the maned wolf is perhaps the most herbivorous.

In fact, the majority of its diet is made up of plant matter. It is from the plants it eats that it gets the chemical pyrazine, which tends to make its urine smell like cannabis (which once set police in Rotterdam on the hunt for illegal smokers).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a89f145b3dbbdcb9a354b0a603f90350-lq)

Of all the flora it eats, it seems that one kind is its favourite - the so-called “wolf apple”, or fruta-do-lobo. It is in truth not an apple, but a sort of cross between a tomato and an eggplant, and up to half of a maned wolf’s diet can be solely wolf apples.

Incidentally, it is thought that is partially because the tannin-rich fruits kill infectious giant kidney worms, which could otherwise kill the animal.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3de4602f2ade39ae9c0197fad9802d63-lq)

Don’t worry, I’m getting to the point soon.

For unknown reasons, when maned wolves defecate, they usually do so directly onto the nests of leafcutter ants. While this may seem rude, this is actually very valuable for the ants, for they cultivate fungus gardens.

Fungi, as you probably know, like to grow on animal feces, so the leafcutters transport the dung into their underground nests. However, before they feed it to their cultivars, they take out the wolf apple seeds and leave them in special refuse piles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-16285d0f00f5287aee873eeb3e7473e3-lq)

Amidst all the ants’ organic waste - which is an excellent fertilizer - the seeds germinate, creating more wolf apple plants for the maned wolves to eat. Thus, the cycle repeats - and it’s almost, but not quite, as if the canines, and not only the ants, have their own form of agriculture.

## Nature Blossoms After Nuclear Meltdown

The wildlife situation around Chernobyl currently is something of a controversy in science. [This 2016 paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0096340211399747 "journals.sagepub.com") says that:

> With few exceptions, wildlife in the zone shows a strong pattern of declining abundance

However, many other scientists say that the local fauna is clearly on the rise, and the popular media seems to have almost invariably gone with their conclusions.

In any case, since - as far as I’m aware - all the studies saying that Chernobyl’s wildlife is in decline are by the same two authors, whereas there are several different biologists who have written papers on increasing animal populations in the area, I’ll assume that the latter are correct for now.

Various camera trapping operations have revealed that the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has grown a healthy population of large mammals, such as grey wolves:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bf5e8757adbad8366a9d2bf4e37b63f4)

European badgers:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-30df592151d4fdf6998efbe6bc7b060e-lq)

Wild boar:

And even moose:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1ab342d957562aaec51df7a2b5b0b0d5-lq)

There are also abundant smaller mammals, including Eurasian beavers, least weasels and voles. Among the birds, there are some “flashy” species, such as the enormous white-tailed sea eagle (Europe’s largest raptor):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-276a4c879ac3739a8db1002d663946a3-lq)

And black storks:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3fb4d1d47592775c0a8fcd7b5084bf87-lq)

And that’s just the native wildlife. Since the disaster, people have released other Eurasian mammals into this involuntary oasis, including European bison:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f3ba98028ea9f5de89fad916d3e36701-lq)

And wild Przewalski’s horses:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bae09491832f29e96ab20ddf2f9c1cf6-lq)

There’s even evidence that animals not seen in the region for over a century are returning, including Eurasian lynx:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8cd17ffc53609094844e04c3e4d43544-lq)

And brown bears:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d5e50ed339c95f63fd8cf72b9b964ce9-lq)

It’s pretty amazing, and also rather sobering, to think that the sheer presence of humans was worse for the environment than a catastrophic nuclear disaster.

## Green Tigers and Blue Monkeys
    
**Upvotes**: 5,066 | **Comments**: 135 | **Date**: [Aug-21](https://www.quora.com/If-wild-animals-both-predators-and-prey-adapted-their-appearance-to-be-a-camo-in-their-natural-habitats-why-are-none-of-them-green/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Our perception of colour is different to that of other animals, and that’s important to keep in mind. Take placental mammals, for example. To a deer in a lush forest, a prowling tiger would not appear orange. If it did, it wouldn’t be very good at ambushing its prey.

Rather, the deer would perceive the tiger as the same colour as the surrounding vegetation.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7fa150956f560c5273664f52daa78949-lq)

Let’s take a closer look and explain why this is. Humans, of course, are primates, and to be more specific we are part of the Old World monkeys, or catarrhines. Most catarrhines are trichromatic \- in their eyes, they have three different types of cones, which are colour-receptive cells.

These three cone cells detect red, blue and green. If red and green fire at once, the brain interprets that as yellow. All other colours are some combination of the previous four. Because we can distinguish red/yellow (orange) from green, a human or a macaque could see the orange tiger in the green grass.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f7372cd95bc48f3600dc4561002151ff-lq)

There are a couple of possible reasons why Old World monkeys became trichromats. It may have been to spot fruit in the trees, or perhaps to notice when one of their peers blushes. Subtle changes in skin tone are one of the many social cues which are important for cooperation in primates.

Reptiles, including birds, are also trichromatic. This is why birds often have such vibrant, colourful plumage, and indeed why there are many green reptiles. That brings me to a second point, which is that there certainly are green animals.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9320c6eca0688941aa9e9bad185288d0-lq)

Some of you may now be wondering - given that our reptilian ancestors were trichromatic - why mammals lost one of their cone cells, only to re-evolve it with the Old World primates. The thing is, while trichromacy is obviously great for colour vision, it’s not the best for seeing in the dark. Old World monkeys are all diurnal, so we don’t have this problem.

However, when the first placental mammals evolved, the world was dominated by dinosaurs, which were far larger and hungrier than them. They could only come out during the night, when most of the trichromatic dinosaurs were inactive. They lost one of their three cone cells in order to have improved night vision, and became dichromatic.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dec40357f0bdf128e46fa92790a64bf8-lq)

This means that they use the same colour receptor for red and green, and thus any kind of brownish or orangey hue will be more or less indistinguishable from the colour of foliage. This is, of course, why most mammals are brown, and why primates are the most colourful mammals:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d668f791a72afcc2c008c22e5cb864ce-pjlq)

Now, some bonus fun facts. Marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, whales, dolphins and so on are in fact monochromatic \- all their cone cells are the same, so instead of perceiving different colours, they simply detect the intensity level of light. Water, being dense, tends to scatter and absorb longer wavelengths of light, so there’s not much reason to have good colour vision.

There are even mammals which are naturally tetrachromatic, which have four different cones - reindeer. Up in the Arctic, the sun may stay in the sky for a very long time, so objects end up absorbing a lot of ultraviolet radiation. Due to their tetrachromacy, reindeer are very sensitive to UV light, and thus food sources like lichen contrast starkly against white snow, which reflects the radiation.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-561a34468d598818376972fc0b45307e-lq)

Anyway, to summarize my answer to your question: while there are certainly many green animals, you don’t often see green mammals because they (and their predators) usually struggle to distinguish brownish colours from the colour of plants. This is because most mammals detect red and green using the same type of cone cell in their eyes.

Thanks for reading, have a great day.

## The Panda That Watched Pornography
    
**Upvotes**: 5,003 | **Comments**: 109 | **Date**: [6mo](https://www.quora.com/Which-animal-seems-like-it-should-have-been-extinct-a-long-time-ago/answer/Gary-Meaney)

The giant panda. Tireless panda conservation efforts are beginning to work their magic on the species’ population, but it can’t be denied that the bear doesn’t do itself any favours when it comes to not going extinct.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a10de636331f5c0e6ac3be9dd7c1f7c4-lq)

Firstly, it has a highly specialized diet, effectively consuming only bamboo, a food source which is mostly just tough cellulose and offers very little in the way of energy, protein or other nutrients. To get its daily calories in, a panda bear must eat up to 14 kg of bamboo, so it spends most of its waking hours feeding (and the remainder defecating, which it has to do around 40 times a day).

And despite all the food they eat, pandas have still had to make compromises in order to be as calorie-efficient as possible. They are slow and sedentary, typically avoiding physical exertion of any sort, and have a similarly slow metabolic rate.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-21e42eedb6d2f569c6c6426cdfc213f1-lq)

The funniest part about all this is that bamboo can be a perfectly viable dietary staple - countless large animals get by eating only grass, for example, which is similarly low in calories. However, the panda digestive system is terrible at processing plant matter - they still have the intestines typical of their recent carnivorous ancestors.

The gut is very straight and short, so the bamboo passes right through their system before it’s had a chance to be properly digested. Grazing animals typically have huge, convoluted intestinal tracts, as well as, in some cases, numerous stomachs. The longer the food is in there, the more nutrients you can extract from it.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-14ab2b61f7823b654f567787b87326f9-pjlq)

One unique thing about many bamboo species, especially those found in China, is that they exhibit a behaviour called gregarious flowering - that is, all bamboo plants from a given species will flower, die and regrow simultaneously. This has led to some interesting ([and devastating](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-little-known-connections-between-historical-events-that-seem-to-have-nothing-to-do-with-each-other/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")) historical phenomena, but it also poses a problem for the pandas.

Because all the bamboo shoots of one species in the area might die at once, giant pandas can only live in regions where there are multiple varieties available, as an insurance policy. This is a further restriction inflicted on them by their bizarrely specialized diet.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-37352bf315b6460626af455072dc104d-pjlq)

And all this isn’t even mentioning their improbable reproductive biology. In the wild, a female will only be receptive to potential mates for a period of 2–3 days once every year. In captivity, as you may have heard, they are even less likely to breed, and some zoos have had resort to using Viagra and, believe it or not, panda pornography to get them in the mood.

I’m sure that was the last two-word phrase you wanted to hear on a Sunday evening, so perhaps it’s best to finish up now. Some creationists have pointed to these biological quirks as evidence of intelligent design (seems like pretty unintelligent design to me), which is of course unreasonable. If anything, pandas are a demonstration that survival and thus evolution isn’t about being perfect, it’s about being good enough.

## A Conga Line of Shrews

Baby shrews travel in conga lines.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-15aa3869f68bd6e711613809657b33fb-lq)

When a mother shrew wants to take her babies places, one will carry her tail in its mouth, then its sibling will do the same to it, and so on. These “caravans” can comprise up to 7 or 8 shrews.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-66cde3fddd208c2c833f95a90ca90422-lq)

To be fair, though, they look a bit less cute when viewed from further away. In fact, they can look like huge, dark, furry centipedes:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9fe5976e7ae32fac08e9ec5c0a3ea99f)

As a less heart-melting aside, a similar behaviour is known from - of all things - a bizarre marine arthropod from the Cambrian period. Synophalos was a shrimp-like creature which evidently travelled in chains, sometimes twenty individuals long.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d01240b60d50f23c29fbbf2ae5611ed9-pjlq)

Another cool fact about shrews is that their brains shrink by 15% in the winter, so they can survive the food-scarce winter. Anyway, I’m getting distracted - this has been my No. 1 cute animal fact you might not know, thanks for reading.

## An Elephant's Funeral
    
**Upvotes**: 1,824 | **Comments**: 37 | **Date**: [Updated 2y](https://www.quora.com/Do-animals-also-have-a-concept-of-God-and-or-religion/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Perhaps. Chimpanzees in the Republic of Guinea habitually hurl rocks at special trees in the forest, the stones accumulating in “cairns”. Biologist Laura Kehoe, who first recorded the behavior using camera traps, hypothesizes that these could be “shrines” for the chimps and held sacred in some form of rudimentary religion.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-66e0b321844e356a73d870456442af2b-lq)

Others say that this practice is just a form of communication, although the idea that only “special” trees are stoned is interesting and might seem to challenge this explanation.

Staying on the topic of chimpanzees, the famous primatologist Jane Goodall has observed another kind of uncannily religious-like behavior. In the Gombe, she’s seen her chimps performing ritual dances at the onset of the rains, or when they come across a waterfall. Here’s a video:

Goodall proposes that these displays could be an early, primitive form of “elemental worship”.

Now, elephants. According to Ronald K. Siegel, a psychopharmacologist who has studied elephant behavior extensively,

> "Elephants are aware of natural cycles, as they practice "moon worship," waving branches at the waxing moon and engaging in ritual bathing when the moon is full."

This isn’t all Siegel has to say on the matter. He’s also documented elephant funeral rituals, which are fairly well-known among animal fans, but he brings up some fascinating lesser-known points.

> When encountering dead animals, elephants will often bury them with mud, earth and leaves. Animals known to have been buried by elephants include rhinos, buffalos, cows, calves, and even humans, in addition to elephants themselves. Elephants have \[been\] observed burying their dead with large quantities of food fruit, flowers and colourful foliage."

The last part is especially revealing. Are these grave goods supplies for their dead friends in some proboscine afterlife, like the gold treasures of Egyptian pharaohs or hoards of Bronze Age kings? Perhaps.

One thing he doesn’t mention is that other herds of elephants have traditions of gathering all their dead into special places - elephant graveyards.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e6fd4887d42ec018e4e657f8cf8287e1-lq)

Besides elephants, there’s only one other animal I would say has proper funeral rites and not just elaborate mourning. Magpies, according to Dr Marc Bekoff, fashion “wreaths” of grass and lay them by their dead peers, and then stand vigil for a while. Similar behaviors are reported in ravens, but not scientifically documented.

Beyond that, chimps and dolphins guard their dead and, in the case of the former species, sit beside the corpse for hours in silence, but this might just be grief rather than a true funeral ritual.

## The Hyena City of Ethiopia
    
**Upvotes**: 1,723 | **Comments**: 70 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/Can-hyenas-be-domesticated/answer/Gary-Meaney)

In the walled town of Harar, Ethiopia, the locals have a curious and starkly unique relationship with local spotted hyenas.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-08e20f68bf4272abca6ac8eb68cc8ac4-lq)

There are currently two hyena feeding places which tourists can visit, at the shrines of Aw Sofi and Aw Aboker respectively. (I’ve heard that the latter one is more formal, more touristy, and - to a degree - more contrived). At these places, “hyena men” throw scraps of meat to wild hyenas which have become habituated to this and come to the feeding places on a nightly basis.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8cf70e5ff2c998e3817e25653579da52-lq)

At the Aboker feeding places, visitors can even have hyenas pull meat from their mouths.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-70b065cdecd741fdc9387bbcdd5d7935-lq)

This tradition, which started about sixty years ago, is by no means just a tourist attraction. At night, many Harari butchers throw their leftovers out onto the streets to waiting hyenas, with no tourists in sight. The hyenas of Harar are said to be special (and that is why they behave so peacefully), for they have become vessels through which one can communicate with saints. They’re also believed to eat malevolent demons - jinn - and when a hyena attacks a human, it is because that person was possessed by one.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4bf237bd3dc2a00d0aa4e1a847d426e8)

Then there’s this annual festival called Ashura, held on a hilltop outside the town. Three mounds of porridge are laid out on a broad, flat stone, and the attendants wait for hyenas to come out and eat it. It’s kind of like the Harari version of groundhog day - if the hyena eats most of the porridge but leaves a bit, the coming year will be prosperous. If he eats it all, there will be famine, and if he eats little, war.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f6952c4cb0b8f3c410f46295a068cbbb-lq)

Anyway, virtually all the locals at Harar adore hyenas, so much so that if a hyena kills one of their livestock, many put it down to themselves not feeding it enough. If only American ranchers had this attitude to wolves.

Similarly, the hyenas have become fully habituated to the local traditions and have very little fear of people, especially people they know well. Dogs were probably domesticated by starting out eating human scraps - interestingly similar to what’s going in in Harar.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b62b3100e1e2fbc627bdf8bf520e1455)

If this ritual was to continue for centuries, I could easily see spotted hyenas becoming a domesticated animal. The most habituated individuals are the ones most likely to come for food and gain a selective advantage, so over time they will get more and more familiar with humans until they’re practically dogs.

## The Fossils That Walk Among Us
    
**Upvotes**: 1,620 | **Comments**: 28 | **Date**: [1y](https://www.quora.com/Which-one-is-regarded-as-a-living-fossil/answer/Gary-Meaney)

A “living fossil” is essentially an organism which is an evolutionary holdover from a lineage which is, otherwise, long extinct. The most famous examples are the likes of coelacanths and horseshoe crabs; however, there are many more which I doubt you’ll have heard of.

As I’m partial to mammals myself, I’ll be discussing some of the most interesting mammalian living fossils here. First of all, we have the rather adorable Amami rabbit, which is found only on two tiny Japanese islands.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8855df52cbdf1f556bf781dad1f8c095-lq)

As you can probably see, it looks quite strange for a rabbit, with very short ears and small eyes. Amami rabbits are nocturnal, sleeping in caves during the day, and they have large claws for digging and even climbing. In fact, this species is so distinct that it’s thought to belong to a primitive lineage of rabbits which were once found from as far as Slovakia to China.

Even more ancient, however, is the Laotian rock rat. When it was discovered in Laos in 2005, it seemed so distinct that it was placed in its own family. However, its discoverers did not think to compare it to fossil rodents, and a year later, it was found that it actually belonged to a rodent family known as Diatomyidae.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2bf74cd8411bf54eecb6531b52d081be-lq)

However, the diatomyids were thought to have gone extinct some 11 million years ago! To this day, there has been no fossil evidence of them found in this eleven million year gap, and the Laotian rock rat has been nicknamed the “coelacanth of rodents”. It is also known as the rat-squirrel, because it resembles a cross between the two creatures in many respects.

The only other living fossil among the mammals which has such a big gap in its fossil record is the monito del monte. This little marsupial, found in the bamboo forests of Chile, has an entire taxonomic order to itself - Microbiotheria. The microbiotheres once roamed much of South America, Australia and even Antarctica, and emerged shortly after the extinction of the non-bird dinosaurs. Today, though, only one species remains.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-60ebfd3f67ce070f1770e75efcc59741-lq)

There are two main groups of marsupials; the Australian marsupials (found in Australia, New Guinea, parts of Indonesia etc.) and the American marsupials (found in North and South America). However, despite living in Chile, genetic studies show that the monito del monte is, in fact, an “Australian” marsupial.

This confirms something which had long been suspected to be true - that marsupials first evolved in South America, not Australia, and crossed over to the latter via Antarctica. Speaking of marsupials, the last species I’m going to mention is called the musky rat-kangaroo.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eb30f3c64b9e392586c8d2a31ff6e9e1-lq)

This is the world’s smallest macropod - the group that includes wallabies, kangaroos and quokkas. It’s also much more primitive than any other macropod, as it walks on four feet, has five toes, and is an omnivore rather than a herbivore. In fact, you could almost call it a living transitional fossil, as these characteristics are associated with the possum-like ancestors of the other macropods.

The musky rat-kangaroo’s genus, Hypsiprymnodon, dates all the way back to the Oligocene Epoch, and is the only living species in the family Hypsiprymnodontidae. The hypsiprymnodontids were once much more widespread in Australia, and even included large, carnivorous species! However, as the continent became drier, they died out, with the last species confined to a small sliver of rainforest in Queensland.

* * *

So, those are four different species of mammals which seem as time travellers from prehistory who have been stranded in the present day. Thank you everyone for reading, I hope you all enjoyed.

The upper canines of the male babirusa grow upwards, not downwards, erupting out of its skin, and - if they develop enough - curving all the way back to pierce its skull and kill it. By that stage, it’ll already have passed on its genes, so evolution doesn’t care.

Tasmanian devils have evolved a common social habit of biting each other. However, that is the perfect way to transmit Devil Facial Tumour Disease, a transmissable cancer which has scourged the entire species and brought them to the brink of extinction. This is the least heartbreaking picture I could find:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0ffe9f85edcd32d4dca2869f5fd80d15-lq)

This is the black-tailed antechinus, a small, carnivorous marsupial. During the mating season, males mate so much that they’re left physically exhausted and fatally crippled. The exertion makes their vital organs fail and within weeks scores of males have died.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bb0f03c88bc67ae9f8140ebb2e598f66-lq)

Because they live exclusively in moist environments and breathe through their skin, almost all species of amphibian are vulnerable to one fatal disease, chytridiomycosis. And it’s taking its toll - global amphibian populations are declining sharply and some have been completely wiped out.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1c082183c1406594c3d15c37fa6d192d-lq)

Lastly, human intelligence. Over the course of human evolution, various selective pressures have resulted in us being the most intelligent species on Earth. We have an astounding capability to build complex tools which allow us to live luxurious lives and become veritably invicible. Look how that’s turned out for us.

Evolution has no foresight, and it can often lead species into dead ends, where their adaptations turn on them. Living in a developed country, the devastating effects of our paradoxical “intelligence” you might not yet have felt. But for every slave, Syrian refugee, or victim of global warming-induced flooding and wildfires, they know all about it.

## The Mystery History of a Very Round Seal
    
**Upvotes**: 1,434 | **Comments**: 30 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/How-did-a-population-of-landlocked-seals-manage-to-establish-itself-in-Lake-Baikal-of-all-places-at-an-altitude-of-450-m-and-several-hundred-kilometers-from-the-Nearest-coastline/answer/Gary-Meaney)

That is a good question - as you say, Russia’s Lake Baikal is where you’d least expect to find wild marine mammals. The nearest ocean water to the lake is the Sea of Okhotsk, with over 1,500 kilometres of dry land in between. Nevertheless, Lake Baikal is the haunt of the Baikal seal, the world’s only exclusively freshwater pinniped and also the smallest species in the group.

Also known as nerpas, Baikal seals usually measure between 1 and 1.4 metres long and weigh, on average, 63–70 kilograms. Thankfully, they’re classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, with about 100,000 individuals in their ranks. The primary food source of the nerpa is the golomyanka, a very strange species of fish found in the lake.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-beb6842ddfcd5be3e77dd77d268019d7-lq)

At the end of the day, we really don’t know for sure how Baikal seals got to Lake Baikal. Some speculate that their ancestors made their way there by way of the Paratethys - a huge inland sea which occupied a sizeable chunk of Eurasia during the Miocene, of which the Black, Caspian and Aral Seas may well be remnants.

The idea is that Miocene seals living in the Mediterranean would have come up through the Paratethys and then, over millennia, migrated along connective rivers and lakes all the way up to Lake Baikal - giving rise to another seal species, the Caspian seal, in the process.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f5c2aa62c47724cd029082611d07eb4b)

However, this hypothesis definitely has its flaws. The Baikal seal is well-adapted to frigid climes (for their size, they have the largest claws of any seal, a feature which allows them to scrape out breathing holes in the ice), and thus don’t seem like animals of Mediterranean origins. They’re much more similar to the (usually) marine ringed seal of the Arctic Ocean.

Additionally, genetic studies show that Baikal seals are more closely related to ringed seals than Caspian seals. This would also throw the Paratethyan theory into question, as it maintains that both Baikal and Caspian seals are the result of the same inland migration. What’s more likely is that Baikal seals came from the Arctic.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e76c4594059705c946cd21e5c41e07d8-lq)

Many species in Lake Baikal are clearly related to animals of the Arctic ocean, such as the omul (a common fish, endemic to the lake, pictured above), which is in the exclusively cold-water genus Coregonus. This would also explain the Baikal seal’s adaptations to an icy environment.

But the question still remains - how did seals cross the 2,000 kilometers which lies between the Arctic Ocean and the lake? Well, what we do know is that about 80,000 years ago, there was an enormous lake (twice the size of the Caspian Sea) in Siberia which was connected to Lake Baikal via the Angara River:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7676faf903853ebfe4ee465a2ce550f5-pjlq)

The only problem is that molecular clock evidence indicates that Baikal seals diverged, in an evolutionary sense, from other seals about 4 million years ago, long before this lake existed. It seems very likely that they migrated through Siberian lakes from the Arctic ocean, but - for now, at least - we don’t know anything about the nature of said lakes.

## A Genocide of Giant, Bird-Eating Mice
    
**Upvotes**: 1,347 | **Comments**: 56 | **Date**: [Oct-31](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-interesting-and-little-known-rodents/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Approximately two out of every five mammal species is a rodent. The 2,000+ varieties in this order inhabit pretty much every terrestrial environment on Earth, and quite a few aquatic environments too. Despite their diversity and abundance, you rarely hear rodents being discussed as interesting animals; rather, they are seen as mundane, or even vile.

That’s a shame, because there are some really fascinating ones out there. Here are a “few” of my favourites.

*   The Malabar giant squirrel, a species which is found only in the subtropical highlands of India. It’s the world’s largest tree squirrel, measuring a whole metre in length, but - even cooler - it is vibrantly colourful. Most mammals are a rather drab hue, as their colour vision is poor, but the Malabar giant squirrel is a gorgeous exception.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-24dd0e99490e21508edc46bb714e98f1-lq)

*   The Laotian rock rat, also known as the rat-squirrel. It’s endemic to Laos, and perplexed naturalists with its uniqueness when it was discovered in 2005. It was soon realized that it belonged to the ancient rodent family Diatomyidae, which we previously thought had gone extinct 11 million years ago! Because of this, it’s nicknamed the “coelacanth of rodents” - it’s a living fossil, in other words.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6edade2f33b760f291e08ea09e5ccca2-pjlq)

*   The bicoloured-spined porcupine of South America. Its namesake feature is its most striking attribute; the spines of this porcupine are yellow with black tips, and said tips get longer and longer towards the front of the body, giving them a cool bicoloured look. The tail, however, has no spines: it’s bare and prehensile, used instead for gripping tree branches.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ed7ae7a6b5b422016490b6b1f0419764-lq)

*   The Siberian flying squirrel. One would imagine that flying squirrels would be inhabitants of steamy jungles, and indeed most are, but this species is very unique in that it resides in icy taigas. It can be found across much of Russia, as well as parts of northern China, Japan, Mongolia, and even Finland and Estonia. This makes it Europe’s only flying squirrel, and Europe’s only gliding animal too.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-19dc1b9f2284d055c6a52d671a40f355-lq)

*   The gruesome house mice of Gough Island. In the 19th century, house mice aboard European ships arrived on this remote volcanic rock in the South Atlantic. Here, they found an abundance of seabirds, which were unadapted to exogenous predators. Believe it or not, the mice took to feasting on the poor birds’ helpless chicks, killing millions every year, and became super-sized in comparison to their mainland counterparts.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f05576278bafaf8a9f746e64c54e72b1-lq)

*   The Laotian giant flying squirrel, a creature shrouded in mystery. Like the rock rat from before, it’s endemic to Laos, and is known only from a single specimen collected from a shady bushmeat market in 2012. Based on this individual, it is the largest squirrel in the world, measuring over a metre in length. Of course, it has never been photographed in the wild, so a closely related species is pictured.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f3d81ad7bbc063a8707b566d5831cff5-lq)

*   The naked mole rat. They’re so weird that I don’t even have space to do them justice here. Their bizarre attributes include [eusocial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusociality "en.wikipedia.org") behaviour (like ants, bees etc.) an absence of hair and subcutaneous fat, lifespans of up to 32 years, immunity to cancer, a cold-blooded metabolism, and the ability to survive without oxygen for 18 minutes by flooding their bloodstream with corrosive lactic acid and performing anaerobic respiration. Oh, and they can’t feel pain.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7cb67548a8f7594b2c81f9aed6846a17-lq)

*   The Baluchistan pygmy jerboa. Jerboas as a whole are very interesting, but this one is my favourite because it’s so tiny. Weighing less than 4 grams, it’s the world’s smallest rodent, and moves about by bouncing on its long hindfeet. Hopping is a form of locomotion which has been adopted by many other desert-dwelling rodents, such as jumping mice, hopping mice, the springhare, the kangaroo rat and the kangaroo mouse (muad’dib from Dune).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-22bd747349937054cb04c2ce0692c440-lq)

*   The pacarana, a South American creature which is - to me - like the cooler, underrated cousin of the better-known capybara. It’s the only surviving member of the Dinomyidae, a family which was once hugely successful, containing species such as the 1,000 kg Josephoartigasia: the biggest rodent of all time. Pacaranas today only weigh up to 15 kg, but that still makes them the fourth-largest living rodent species.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-efa811e27f81b75e7eeead5c030a9034-lq)

*   The anomalures, which look like flying squirrels at first glance, but are only distantly related. Rather, they evolved wing membranes and gliding flight independently of squirrels, making them one of the five instances of “volplaning” evolving in mammals (the other three being colugos, gliding possums and the extinct volaticotheres\*). Anomalures are also unique in that they have keratinous scales underneath their tails.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5fefd7286fc677b629f2938aa9342d52-lq)

\*Ancestral bats may have glided too, and indeed bats themselves technically have the ability to glide, though they prefer powered flight

*   The bizarre blesmols, a family closely related to the naked mole-rat. These African rodents spend virtually all of their lives underground, digging complex tunnel systems and pulling plants down below the surface by their roots. They are well-adapted to this lifestyle, with gigantic incisors and massively powerful jaw muscles. Some blesmols have even been known to gnaw inch-deep holes into solid concrete!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-531cfebea3ac0df1a62bd84b27c8ef58-lq)

Anyways, that’s my take on a compilation of wonderful rodents, some of which you might not have heard of before. Honourable mentions go out to mountain beavers, zokors, viscachas, capybaras and maras. Thank you very much for reading, hopefully you enjoyed the answer, and have a great Halloween.

## The Forgotten Pet from Patagonia

Actually, they weren’t. Meet the late Fuegian dog:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-15aa8ccd926ce680538795e13bab1544-lq)

Despite its name, this was no dog. Rather, it was a domesticated form of the culpeo, a species of fox which still inhabits much of the Andes mountain range:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eaf96fd7702ffe5f57ad158d5d1e22a7-lq)

Fuegian dogs were kept by the Yaghan people, an ethnic group which are found in the Southern Cone of South America. They were tawny or white in colour, and had erect, triangular ears and a bushy tail. One Argentine explorer described them as “a stunted cross between an Alsatian police dog and a wolf”.

They were used for hunting otters, and, apparently, for warmth. They would gather around their owners, “taking the shape of a kind of wrapping”, keeping them warm in the Patagonian cold. Such good boys.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9f27f9e31333415831f65e2db91ef4ac-lq)

However, some writers noted that they were much less loyal than a dog of the lupine kind. They would allegedly abandon their owners when they were in danger, and often wandered on their own.

Indeed, their eventual extinction was the result of years of extermination, because they posed a danger to cattle and even humans. The last Fuegian dog likely died out between 1880 and 1919. If they hadn’t gone extinct, then today we might have two species of domestic canine to choose from.

## Killer Whales and Their Culture
    
**Upvotes**: 889 | **Comments**: 11 | **Date**: [3y](https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-animals-have-ethnicity-in-their-genetics-or-evolution-like-humans/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Killer whales have what’s called a cosmopolitan distribution; that is, their range extends over much of the planet, and so with all that distance between some populations, distinct “ecotypes” have emerged which not only look different but have different dialects of language and hunting cultures.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7d4b3e0f50c12f1e82c7dc904fdd9a61-lq)

It’s commonly taught that there are two “races” of killer whale - resident and transient - but that’s not entirely true. There are actually 8 more of these variations, each with their own specific behaviours and appearances.

Resident and Ross Sea Killer Whales feed mainly on fish, Antarctic Type A and Type 2 Eastern North Atlantic Killer Whales hunt, primarily, whales and other cetaceans, and Bigg’s Killer Whales are sort of generalist mammal-eaters. Ever seen a pod of orcas “wave-wash” a Weddell seal off an iceberg?

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1f3aae72bd096f39ff38ac340ff32eb4-lq)

Those’ll be Pack Ice Killer Whales. Gerlache Killer Whales commonly go after penguins, while Offshore Killer Whales are shark specialists. The preferred prey of the recently identified Subantarctic Killer Whale is not yet known.

The only real difference between human “ethnicities” is not genetic, but cultural and social. So, I’ve shown you an animal with geographically varying cultures, but granted, it’s just one. If you were to ask “Why are there so few animals with ethnicity?, then the answer would be;

The existence of ethnicities first requires culture, and culture is something which incredibly few animals have. In addition to that, you need a huge distribution range like humans or orcas, which is why elephants or chimpanzees don’t have ethnicities.

Hope this answers your question.

## The Lemur Lookalike that Pollinates Flowers
    
**Upvotes**: 766 | **Comments**: 70 | **Date**: [7mo](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-strangest-animals-in-the-Brazilian-Amazon/answer/Gary-Meaney)

The Amazon Rainforest is one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth: as it’s home to millions of species, many of which we’ll probably never discover, I had a hard time deciding on the choicest specimens to discuss. However, I’m pretty happy with this selection below.

Here are my choices, at least some of which you hopefully haven’t heard of. Buckle up, and enjoy!

*   The kinkajou. This adorable critter is perhaps the most frugivorous mammal in the world; over 90% of its diet is fruit. It also loves flower nectar, and thus acts as an important pollinator! With a prehensile tail, it’s highly specialized for living in the trees - so much so that it was originally thought to be a primate. However, it’s a carnivoran, related to raccoons and the like.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a278eb949d59d7f521cc89ccbd2bf756-lq)

*   The white bellbird, the loudest bird on the planet. In 2019, the male’s otherworldly mating call - which resembles an ear-splitting electronic beep - was measured at 125 decibels. That’s literally louder than a chainsaw, or a thunder clap. The male bird’s appearance is likewise bizarre; all white, except for a fleshy black wattle which dangles from his beak. The females are much less flashy, and olive-coloured.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cf96058247e23a112d1e6abbfa0ee21d-lq)

*   The Amazon milk frog. This is the only vertebrate in the world which has blue blood - the lining of the mouth is blue, and injured individuals bleed blue too. Juveniles also have a bluish tinge overall due to their skin being very thin. Arthropods also have blood of this colour, since theirs is filled with hemocyanin, not hemoglobin. However, I think it’s more likely that this frog just has blue pigment in its bloodstream.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d8a92a0d3eab36d62d4341ae75ebe0ed-lq)

*   The notorious candiru. This parasitic fish is often claimed to have the grisly habit of entering human urethras, even swimming up streams of urine to get there. However, the evidence for this is anecdotal at best, and it’s probably not true. However, what the candiru does do is suck the blood of larger fish by wedging itself in their gills and latching on. That horror alone justifies its inclusion.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b6efe20e5e769fbb390cbed4df2bfe1-lq)

*   Coral. In only 2016, scientists made the incredible discovery that there is a huge coral reef system in the mouth of the Amazon River. Spanning over 9,300 square kilometres, the Amazon Reef is a totally unique ecosystem - owing this to the fact that for parts of the year, it’s clouded in the mud spewed out by the river, which blocks out the sun. The water is also much less saline than that tolerated by any other corals.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5480bd6da2a9cca4739f1609c650334b-lq)

*   The diminutive bush dog, a lesser-known relative of the maned wolf. Ironically, it’s the anatomical opposite of its cousin - while the maned wolf is 90% legs, the bush dog is a stubby little pupper. They hunt in packs, and usually feed on giant rodents like capybaras and pacas. However, in numbers they can take even larger prey - one pack was seen hunting a quarter-ton tapir, fifty times the size of a bush dog!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ee99b0719db84e6e8815d3c74aef1047-lq)

*   The oilbird. This nocturnal feathered friend is so unique that it has a taxonomic family of its own. It’s almost like a bird trying to be a bat; it roosts in huge colonies in caves, and it’s one of the very few birds which can perform echolocation, by producing high-frequency clicks. Its night vision is much better, though - its eyes have an extremely high density of rod cells, a composition comparable to deep sea fish.

*   The aptly named paradoxical frog, which is perhaps the only animal that grows down instead of up. After their eggs hatch, the tadpoles become massive - at up to 27 cm long, they’re the longest tadpoles in the world. Eventually, they begin to metamorphose into a fully developed frog, but by the time the process is complete, they may be as little as a quarter of their original size.

*   The tamandua knifefish, a testament to just how murky and muddy Amazonian rivers can get. It dwells near the bed of deep streams, places choked with so much silt that the water is pitch black. Because of this, it’s completely blind, has no pigmentation, and navigates using electrical fields. It gets its name from its long snout, used for sucking up prey, which resembles that of an anteater (tamandua).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6b1d032a0e1eafbaeb002bf30f503b7a-lq)

*   Socratea exorrhiza - a plant, yes, but an interesting one - and one which was misunderstood. For unknown reasons, this palm tree has bizarre stilt roots. One scientist hypothesized that they could grow a new, upright trunk if the tree was knocked down; another that they allowed it to travel to better lighting conditions. These were later disproven, but the popular myth of the “walking tree” still persists.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7e84cf59b64ea9ba217bbdf8236a89bb-pjlq)

*   The very underrated short-eared dog, a reclusive and little-known canine. They’re very unique among the dog family, much more similar to cats in many ways - solitary, jungle-dwelling, and nocturnal. The males are significantly smaller than the females, again like many felines, and during the mating season they secrete musk from their tail glands, and produce noises which are reportedly similar to that of owls.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ec955f779193ea52f98d703d35ee7f6e-lq)

*   The incredible hoatzin. The chicks of this unspeakably unique bird have claws, used for climbing, on their wings - a vestige of their reptilian ancestry. It mainly eats leaves, unlike other birds, which ferment in its multi-chambered digestive system, similar to that of a cow. It’s often known as the stinkbird because of this fermentation process, and its esophagus is so large that it makes the bird a terrible flyer.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-65848b06cfe0612cde202ce1459b19af-lq)

*   The emerald tree boa. This species isn’t particularly obscure - I’m sure you’ve seen pictures of it before - but most people don’t know how unique it really is. Proportionally, this boa has the largest fangs of any non-venomous snake; they are terrifyingly overdeveloped. Because of the huge “canine” teeth, it has the scientific name Corallus caninus. Note also the special slots for them in the lower lip.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e5914c23e9958a6dcceca344d6551a06-pjlq)

*   The payara, another owner of frightening fangs. Sometimes referred to as the vampire fish, this predatory fish is found throughout the Amazon River. The teeth on its lower jaw are extremely enlarged, and there are reports of it reaching body lengths of over a metre! That might have been a misidentification of a closely related species, however. In any case, the fangs are used to spear passing smaller fish.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ec98d21aecd2caf0d85c5c6502c0f019-lq)

*   Riggia puyensis, a stomach-churning parasite straight out of Alien. It’s an isopod, related to woodlice, and after mating it finds an armoured catfish (which I’ll mention later) to burrow into. It’ll live out its life inside the fish’ chest cavity, and can be up to a fifth of the host’s size. It leaves a small incision in the skin, from which a stream of its eggs can flow out. A pretty brutal way to give your kids a good start in life.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7321c3cd44b9ddbb7aa35201628a46eb-pjlq)

*   The crab-eating raccoon, a close cousin of the better-known common raccoon. It always associates closely with water, because as its name suggests, it feeds on shellfish such as crabs, crayfish, and clams. That being said, it’s not a picky eater, and has an omnivorous diet. Its molar teeth and cheek muscles are more developed than the common raccoon’s, perfect for cracking open hard shells.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-83abf0ba9bc0ffd5993f6b1c2b940f42-lq)

*   The wood stork. The main reason I think this bird is really cool is because of its featherless head and neck. The bare skin contains a lot of the protein keratin, which gives it a tough, scaly appearance, almost like tree bark - hence the name. It builds huge nests in mangrove trees, by the water’s edge, and stands over a metre tall when fully grown. Like many storks, its food consists mainly of fish and crustaceans.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e22cd0137888cc098a282778a8b316c2-lq)

*   The Orinoco crocodile, which isn’t a resident of the Brazilian Amazon per se, but does inhabit the northern reaches of the Amazon Rainforest. It’s a wonder that it’s little-known, because it’s an absolute monster - the largest specimen known was nearly seven metres long and weighed 1,100 kg! This individual would have been the largest reptile on Earth before its death. It’s also a cannibal, sometimes feeding on other Orinoco crocodiles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-81826b61275e3b6984ab825fcc76c31f-lq)

*   The tambaqui - basically a piranha, but much bigger and… chubbier. Also known as the giant pacu, they can measure over a metre in length, and have substantial reserves of fat for storing nutrients. Unlike piranhas, they actually eat a lot of plant food, and as such have uncannily human-like squared-off teeth. Large specimens are more than a metre long and weigh up to 44 kilograms.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-20233b96b82b4cb3561f3e48627d6b82-lq)

*   The Amazon giant leech. To its credit, it’s exactly what it says on the tin - a disgustingly large bloodsucking worm from the Amazon jungle. Measuring up to 45 centimetres in length (and 10 in width), it’s one of the largest leeches in the world, and believe it or not is kept as a pet by some. When it latches onto its host - often a human - it secretes the unique compound hementin, an enzyme which prevents coagulation.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e8b6af168aed593563baea3495396721-pjlq)

*   Now, a wildcard - the Peruvian tiger, an animal which doesn’t actually exist, but was once thought to. In the Peruvian Amazon, locals had reported seeing a strange big cat, “el tigre”, allegedly reddish in colour, with white stripes. Then in 1996, a pair of unusual pantherine skulls were found - evidence of a new species? Further inspection, however, found they belonged to jaguars, perhaps with aberrant colouration in life.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4dd5e69760d73808646956bd35197555-pjlq)

*   The wonderful great potoo. This bird is one of those creatures that exists somewhere in the grey area between “adorable” and “terrifying”. It has huge eyes, the pupils of which can dilate to astonishing proportions, and its mouth is even more outsize. During the night, it camouflages itself perfectly as a branch on a tree trunk, a disguise with which it can snatch unsuspecting insects flying by.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3d83b3636173d29c50b7523af37a608a-lq)

*   The mata mata. This bizarre-looking freshwater turtle, like the potoo, imitates wood - in this case, it’s camouflaged as a piece of bark, with its head emulating a fallen leaf. When a potential victim swims by, they thrust out their huge necks, opening their mouths to create a negative-pressure vacuum in their throat. The helpless prey is sucked in and eaten - indeed, its name means “I kill” in a local tongue.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5158e2372301f6c23aae50c149ec1549-lq)

*   The discus ray, one of South America’s 30 or so species of river stingrays, or potamotrygonids. Unlike the vast majority of rays, most members of this family live exclusively in freshwater, and the discus ray is no exception. It’s one of the world’s largest freshwater stingrays, its perfectly circular body being up to 1.6 metres across. Even more impressively, large ones weigh more than 100 kg!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-04cdb22d27b20b0d209813675988a6e2-lq)

*   Turtle ants. Cephalotes is an ant genus distributed across the Neotropics, with many of its species found in the Amazon. They carve the tunnels of their nest into trees and branches, which have many openings. Incredibly, to guard these entrances, turtle ants have evolved a whole unique caste of soldiers which have broad, flattened heads - perfect for sealing the doorway. Also, they’re able to glide between trees.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-72f211fded478197a30945278aa64024-lq)

*   The silky anteater, which is by far the world's strangest species of anteater. It's much smaller than its relatives, and lives out its life in the trees - hence the huge, circular claws and prehensile tail. It comes out at night to forage for ants and wasps, hiding in silk cotton trees during the day. It's hypothesised that this is because it's camouflaged to look like the fluffy white seed pods of this tree!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eb4c159c6642a1fc432e219d9343a53d-lq)

*   The king vulture. Out of the Amazon's four vulture species, this one is the largest, comparable in size even to male harpy eagles, which it often overlaps with. Its most striking feature, however, is undoubtedly its colouration - its bald head has shades of red, orange, yellow, black, grey, blue and purple. The king vulture features abundantly in ancient Mayan scriptures too, perhaps being held sacred by that culture.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-27ec675324bb3a78fc8d51ac02713e40-lq)

*   Horned treefrogs, of which there are a handful of species. Like many frogs, they have an incredibly weird reproductive strategy. After mating, the male attaches the newly fertilized eggs onto the female. She has a sticky, gelatin-coated patch on her back, so the eggs adhere there. When they eventually hatch, the babies skip the tadpole phase entirely, emerging as froglets.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-40650b8fc4f9841d6dd188bea25d75cb-pjlq)

*   The piraíba, known scientifically as Brachyplatystoma filamentosum. That’s a mouthful. It’s one of the largest fish in the Amazon River, perhaps exceeded in size only by the arapaima, which I’ll discuss shortly. This catfish can approach three metres in length and weigh in excess of 150 kg. They also make massive annual migrations, travelling from the Amazon Estuary up to the base of the Andes.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d63094e2553996b446569faa71258362-lq)

*   Now, another insect - Onychocerus albitarsis. This beetle is poorly studied as of now, and doesn’t have a common name, but it’s the only animal in the world which delivers venom via its antennae. Yes, its two huge feelers are tipped with scorpion-like hooks which can sting a potential attacker - causing redness and itching for humans. This also means that they’re the only stinging beetles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0fab162e7ed6a414b32fb6736c2c45d4-lq)

*   The yapok. I’ve written about this cute little guy once or twice before. Also known as the water opossum, it’s really the only living semi-aquatic marsupial, swimming using its webbed back feet. Uniquely, both males and females have a pouch - it can seal shut to protect the reproductive organs underwater. Furthermore, it possesses opposable thumbs - which are sixth digits likely adapted from wrist bones!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-434e67b6c443bc3476c46ec61ec59c63-lq)

*   The sword-billed hummingbird, a native of the Andean cloud forests on the far fringes of the Amazon. Its most conspicuous feature is, of course, it’s upward-curving, tube-shaped bill, which is even longer than the body if you exclude the tail. This gives it an edge over competitors, as it can reach nectar which would otherwise be inaccessible. It’s also one of the world’s largest hummingbirds overall.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cb3b543d3ba70185a28e1edcbc457b39-lq)

*   The common Surinam toad. This bizarre, flat amphibian has a reproductive method similar to that of the aforementioned horned treefrog, but it takes it a step further. The female’s back is covered in holes, openings to hollow pockets below the skin. The male pushes the eggs in her, after which they develop and hatch. Then, the baby toads crawl out of all the holes - a trypophobe’s nightmare.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7f500f29764e790f185f5976a56bf9f7-lq)

*   Armoured suckermouth catfish \- told you I’d get to these eventually. This diverse family has a lot of unique quirks. First, there’s obviously their namesake bony armour plating. Then there’s their other namesake - a weird circular mouth on the ventral side, which they feed with using suction. Their “omega irises” are also really strange - when the pupils contract, they become crescent-shaped, like a ring open at one end.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6615d43df00055624c27582f5c1f2e14-lq)

*   The water hyacinth \- another plant, but definitely worthy of note. In the Amazon Basin itself, this aquatic plant has many natural predators. However, when it’s introduced elsewhere, it grows explosively - choking waterways with over 50 kg of matter per square metre. This blocks out the sun, which causes all the other water plants to die, and the bacteria which decompose all the dead plants cause an oxygen crisis in the water.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e0d06a92d6c5260fb769428542aff08d-lq)

*   The tayra, another one of those South American carnivorans that deserve much more attention. It’s a close relative of the northerly wolverine, but with a slimmer build, shorter fur and a longer tail. An adept treetop navigator, it can even sprint along branches, and can be easily identified by its yellow throat patch. Interestingly enough, some tayras have been observed storing inedible plantains in caches so they can ripen.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ff1cbbd258cd930a4395ff47655f9c34-lq)

*   The blue-backed manakin. At a glance, it doesn’t look particularly interesting, although its colours are quite nice. However, what sets it apart its behaviour. When a male tries to impress a female, he’ll perform a courtship dance - but not alone. Rather, males band together to form dance troupes and move in synchrony. Despite being direct competitors, the way they cooperate increases everyone’s chance of getting a date.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-63afc872937ea54bcd5c34913dbfc04b-lq)

*   The caecilian Atretochoana. It has a common name, but not one that’s very suitable for the children reading - and yes, I know what it looks like. Caecilians are limbless amphibians, and this species is incredibly unique because it has no lungs - instead, it breathes through its capillary-covered skin. It’s the only land animal anywhere near its size (it’s ~80 cm long) that can survive without lungs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5550b392c1b86e2feef503e1ee618fba-lq)

*   An Amazonian icon, the piracuru. This is actually the fifth fish on this list that’s been caught by Jeremy Wade, which honestly doesn’t surprise me at all. It’s the largest species of arapaima, and the largest freshwater fish on Earth - some specimens measuring over 4 metres in length and 200 kg in weight. Though it has functioning gills, it also requires air to survive, and frequently surfaces to breathe.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-33f53470f90ce6ee6b37443f75ea1278-lq)

*   The peanut bug, one of the wackiest-looking insects there is. It’s a member of the planthoppers, a group renowned for their fancy headgear, but this one is in a league of its own. It has a huge, hollow structure on its head that extends far past its eyes, and resembles a peanut in shape. This is used to knock against trees, producing sound to attract mates, although it might have the secondary purpose of mimicking a snake’s head.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a9282af780c203823f63d25d5acec000-lq)

*   The jaguarundi, the last of the many carnivoran mammals in this piece. It’s the closest relative of the better-known puma, but it’s much smaller, weighing up to 9 kilograms. Unlike most cats, it’s mainly active during daytime, and its build recalls that of a weasel or otter - short legs, high hips, small head and long body. Indeed, it’s often called the “otter cat”. Jaguarundis can be reddish, grey, or occasionally black.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bc83798e0648c109dff815ba8e613c53-lq)

*   The Amazonian umbrellabird. This all-black bird is the largest passerine bird in South America, measuring up to 55 cm in length. What really makes it (and all umbrellabirds) interesting, though, are the males’ display features. They have a thick crest on top of the head and a long, feathery wattle dangling from the neck, which can be inflated with air. In [some species](https://ebird.org/species/lowumb1 "ebird.org") found outside the Amazon, the wattle is even more pronounced.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eba28000c785a925d1ecf2bd369e5135-lq)

*   The Amazon climbing salamander. Everyone knows that chameleons can shoot out their tongues to catch insects, but few know that climbing salamanders are even better at it. In fact, for their size, the tongue of these amphibians is the fastest and most powerful muscle in the animal kingdom, producing 18,000 watts of power per kilogram. They can retract their extended tongues in a positively ridiculous 3 milliseconds.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f739c84ea246ee53dd3dab2baab6409d)

(A closely related species is pictured above, as it’s the only good photo that illustrates a climbing salamander’s tongue I could find)

*   The glasswing butterfly, an insect which also ranges up towards Mexico. While most butterflies and moths use environmental colouration or mimicry to camouflage, the glasswing is simply transparent. The structure of its wings is insanely intricate; formed of complex microscopic “nanopillars”. These are perfectly shaped to ensure that no light reflects off the transparent wing, no matter what angle a predator is looking from.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f30bd6554e930ffd11a7dd1a4c705e9a-lq)

*   The Amazonian manatee, one of the world’s three species of manatee. It’s much smaller than its West Indian and African counterparts, usually averaging around “only” 200 kilograms in the wild, and it’s the only manatee that lives exclusively in freshwater. During the flood season, they build up fat grazing in the submerged forests, before retreating to deep lakes and rivers and eating next to nothing for months.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-df1b359121cf6a83c6596423131fcb99-lq)

*   The jabiru stork. It’s among the world’s tallest flying birds, and among the largest storks in the world too. The largest jabirus can be roughly three metres from wingtip to wingtip, and stand five feet tall. Their nests are similarly huge, measuring a metre across but - curiously - being almost twice as deep. The name jabiru means “swollen neck” in the language of a local Amazonian ethnic group, which is apt.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7ac2798bfd9769f01b18c387948053ec-lq)

*   The insanely cool-looking sabertooth longhorn beetle. It’s got a wicked pattern on its carapace, and a pair of huge serrated mandibles which give it its name. If you include these frightening jaws, it’s the world’s longest beetle, and it’s nearly as large in mass as the titan beetle, which is also found in the Amazon. It lives over 95% of its life (around a decade) as a larva, spending only a few months in its photogenic adult phase.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a61a067a2fdbb5c21e6784c0c4d9e5e7-lq)

*   The proboscis bat, our last mammal. As its name suggests, it has a little trunk, a pointed fleshy snout which recalls that of a tapir. Its other distinguishing feature is the pair of white stripes which run down its back, likely for camouflage. However, what I find coolest about the proboscis bat is the way it roosts; they sleep in single-file lines along the underside of tree branches.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a90285e21932bd3542044feefac5e808-pjlq)

*   The jabuticaba, our third and final plant. This tree is well-known for its odd fruits, which pepper it all over. They resemble dark, spherical grapes, and grow directly on the trunk in clusters. Beneath the purple skin is sweet, jelly-like flesh, which can be made into a variety of drinks and preserves. The jabuticaba has been farmed by South Americans since before the arrival of Europeans.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1decf7acef683e885a4f429d8a4e64ad-lq)

*   I’ll finish with an outlandish feathered friend - the bearded bellbird. While the females of this species are a dull green-brown, the males are… eye-catching, to the say the least. From the underside of their beak hangs their “beard” - a cluster of thin, fleshy wattles. They remind me of dreadlocks. Like the aforementioned white bellbird, it’s very loud, and has a metallic hammering call which gives it the alternate name anvil-bird.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5d562198fef6b58d4f54e2cabd9a12d2-lq)

If you’ve made it this far, I applaud your attention span - and appetite for juicy, succulent animal knowledge. Those were my top fifty (yes, fifty…) picks for the most bizarre, most interesting and most underrated species found in the vast and diverse Amazon Rainforest.

I had fun writing this answer, so I hope you had some fun reading it! Thank you very much for getting through the whole thing, and have a great day.

## The Seafaring Bat and its Supersized Feet
    
**Upvotes**: 663 | **Comments**: 8 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-animals-have-the-weirdest-feet/answer/Gary-Meaney)

There’s a species of bat which dwells on coastlines in the Gulf of California, known as Myotis vivesi. As bats go, it has enormous feet:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bd58782b0bde3e6b8ec0e6518a20917f-lq)

Tipped with wicked claws, no less:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3b8fe79a7a74fc73a40a63f902ff3ef3-lq)

So, why the Hobbitish proportions? Thankfully, they are not an adaptation for clawing open human scalps. Rather, they’re for fishing.

Among bats, there are other species which hunt aquatic prey, certainly, but M. vivesi is special. It doesn’t just scoop fish out of streams in the rainforest - it’s arguably a marine mammal. It feeds exclusively on fish, crustaceans, and sometimes even algae. Cooler still, it has evolved concentrated urine, which means it can drink seawater.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-98c31addffc4d7228abb7b23734978af-lq)

Besides their giant feet, the other feature of this bat which I find amazing is the uropatagium - the membrane of skin between the legs. This is actually used as a fishing net - fish get caught in it before the claws close in and grasp them. How mindblowing is that?

Additionally, the uropatagium is lined with very long, fine hairs. Their function is mysterious - some say they’re sensory in purpose, others hypothesize that they’re used to catch small crustaceans.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-446d1b27aa3f5220e811ae75e2113a1c-lq)

Above, you can see the bat’s needle-like teeth, which are specially adapted for slicing through slippery fish. Myotis vivesi only visit dry land at dawn to roost, which they do on coastal rock formations and caves. Interestingly enough, they have been known to share their roosting spots with petrels (large seabirds).

So, it turns out this little sea bat is a lot more than a pair of big feet. Myotis vivesi is yet another example of how diverse the 1,200 species of bat really are.

## The Weird World of Bats, From Trunks to Suction Cups
    
**Upvotes**: 651 | **Comments**: 40 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-interesting-things-do-you-know-about-bats/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Right then, time for yet another list answer about “cool species of X”. I wonder what I’ll do on Quora when I run out of species…  
In any case, here are some of my favourite species of bat.

*   Honduran white bat: This enigmatic creature is native to tropical forests in Central America. Snow-white and fluffy, it famously constructs “tents” by folding up the leaves of Heliconia plants. In these tents, colonies of the bats roost at night. Honduran white bats mostly eat fruit; in fact they’re one of the smallest frugivorous bats.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-12d33a8718a82abd34fb97410d181e36-lq)

*   Hairless bat: As its name suggests, this molossid bat is largely hairless, though it does have some bristly hairs on its neck and toes. Hailing from Southeast Asia, they’re the largest species of insectivorous bat in the world and also have an opposable thumb on each back foot. I can’t seem to find any hypotheses on why they’re hairless.

*   Sucker-footed bat: Like many weird critters, this is a Madagascan animal. Each of its limbs ends in a cup, from which adhesive fluid is secreted. The bats use these sticky suckers to roost on very smooth leaves that parasites can’t get any purchase on. In 2006, it was discovered that there was a second species, the western sucker-footed bat.

*   Painted bat: This very Halloween-y looking creature is instantly recognizable for its bright colours. While they may seem striking, they actually help the bat camouflage in the dried leaves of Southeast Asia’s arid woodlands. Like most other vesper bats, painted bats use echolocation and catch insects on the wing (this is known as hawking).

*   Proboscis bat: This little bat of the neotropics is enigmatic for two reasons. For one thing, it has an odd, tapir-like trunk (hence the name), which you can see sticking out if you look closely at the image. Secondly, they’re known for their behaviour of roosting in organized, single-file lines along thick branches. They’re usually found near wetlands or water.

*   Hawaiian hoary bat: This one is interesting not for its anatomy, but for its location. Unless you count Hawaiian monk seals, it’s the only native land mammal of the Hawaiian islands, which are too isolated for most large mammals. “Hoary” essentially means “frosted” and refers to the white tips of their fur.

## The Cuddly Canine That Carried COVID
    
**Upvotes**: 442 | **Comments**: 26 | **Date**: [Aug-02](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-cutest-animal-that-no-one-knows-about/answer/Gary-Meaney)

There are plenty of great choices one could make here, but I think I’m going to go with the raccoon dog. It’s not the most obscure animal I’ve written about by any means, but it’s not as well known as it ought to be for sure.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-df84971de6ae6059f65179f94dc27ed4-lq)

Needless to say, they are really damn cute.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b48d7391adc144673bd611a123564ff8-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a63618d55e5163b6cb18fa55511bb894-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-67d401c9efe1b125c060d4df033aa95d-lq)

The raccoon dog is so named because of the black bands around its eyes, but it is not a raccoon. Rather, it’s a canine species, particularly closely related to the bat-eared fox of Sub-Saharan Africa. This fox (perhaps coincidentally) also has a black mask, despite looking otherwise different.

East Asia, however, is the natural domain of the raccoon dog. It’s native to much of Eastern China, Japan and the Korean Peninsula, as well as parts of Indochina and the Russian Far East. They also now inhabit much of Europe, introduced there by the Soviets.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-516ac3ec82d0293390fa2122909ab6ec-pjlq)

Within this range, there are five subspecies; procyonoides, viverrinus, ussuriensis, koreensis, and orestes. The third one, the Ussuri raccoon dog, is the one found in Europe, but the second type is the most well-known in online circles - the Japanese raccoon dog, or tanuki.

Speaking of names, raccoon dogs are referred to as neoguri in Korea (which has since become a popular noodle brand there) and mangut by the Evenk people of Russia and northern China.

They are typically a greyish-brown colour, but can occasionally be white:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4ad7e55183d05b68b4941dfbd0c3450f-lq)

Or even orange:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cde200a4f6d13589937ca84ed82948a7-pjlq)

There are a few other reasons why I find these guys really interesting. First of all, they’re the only canids in the world which hibernate.

In the leadup to the winter months, raccoon dogs eat loads of food, making sure they’re fattened up. That’s why they often look so marvelously rotund.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-535d9a747a2e68c61016d26aaaf1af5c-lq)

Look at that absolute sphere. Some of it is fluff, but there is no other canine which gets that chunky in the wild. When winter comes and they’re in full bulk mode, the dogs begin to hibernate, entering a state of torpor - that is, their body temperature lowers and their metabolism slows down.

If they weren’t cute enough already, they often do so huddled together, which probably helps keep them warm.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-41e0333e2658ed45aae43348f0e1e991-lq)

In warmer regions, however, raccoon dogs often do not hibernate, or only do so during harsh snowstorms.

In terms of diet, they are not fussy in the slightest. They’ll feed on just about any small animal they can catch, even highly poisonous frogs. When eating these toxic amphibians, they salivate profusely, effectively diluting the poison. They also eat a lot of birds.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b96ae0fee4124e894c9c4bafc46c075f-lq)

As well as live prey, they often consume carrion, dung (not a personal favourite of mine but I’m not one to judge), fruits, vegetables, nuts and berries. To access fruit, they frequently climb trees, something which not many canines can do.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5d366f6ea021d1df4dd8dbc741f03ac8-lq)

Another thing which is pretty cool about them is their vocalizations. You might expect them to bark, as they are members of the dog family, but their vocal repertoire consists mainly of yelps, whines, mews, and growls. The tanuki variety of Japan is said to sound quite similar to a cat.

When they are juvenile, the father spends a lot more time tending them than the mother, and is, unusually enough, very involved in the process of raising young. Speaking of the young, I can’t help but share this photo of these baby raccoon dogs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f938462fc2d8bee7a1d6f60996d95627-lq)

One more fact - this species has been repeatedly noted as a carrier of various forms of coronavirus. Some hypothesize that a raccoon dog was likely one of the original vectors of COVID-19, as they are commonly bred in China.

Anyway, those are some interesting things you might not have known about the raccoon dog, and underrated and cuddly wild animal. Thank you very much for reading, have a great day.

## Swimming Possums and Their Sealable Pouches
    
**Upvotes**: 306 | **Comments**: 35 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-little-known-facts-about-marsupials/answer/Gary-Meaney)

I think that the yapok, Chironectes minimus, is very interesting, yet fairly little known. Also known as the water opossum, it’s found over much of South and Central America, and it’s pretty cute too. They mainly eat fish, but sometimes actually manage to catch sleeping bats.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ffd553573094aa6d83f3af9f3bf23730-lq)

It is a fascinating creature in numerous ways. First of all, it’s the only truly semi-aquatic marsupial in the world. Its close relative, the lutrine opossum, does venture into the water every now and then, but not enough to be called semi-aquatic.

Yapoks have evolved several adaptations to improve their aquatic abilities. Their back feet are webbed, though their front ones aren’t - perhaps to maintain dexterity. What’s very cool, though, is that they can seal their pouches shut so they can swim without their young drowning.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f998ca5ae6e385446eeb0b3a5ba478a5-lq)

Yapoks are also the only extant marsupials in which males have pouches as well as females. These are nearly as airtight as the females’, and are used to protect the reproductive organs in cold water.

Yet another interesting thing about these opossums is that it appears that they have independently evolved a sixth digit, likely derived from a wrist bone. Better yet, this extra digit is opposable just like the human thumb. Perhaps, in the far future, intelligent yapoks will dominate the world and build civilizations as we did…

## A Sweaty Horse is a Soapy Horse
    
**Upvotes**: 101 | **Comments**: 9 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/How-do-horses-sweat/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Horses perspire in the same manner as we, and all mammals, do - via the eccrine and apocrine sweat glands clustered underneath the epidermis. These glands produce sweat - a salty, water-rich secretion, which regulates temperature through evaporative cooling.

What’s special about horse sweat is that it contains a protein called latherin, a naturally-occuring detergent - and this applies to zebras, not just domestic horses, by the way.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dd85b7da152ad0d8f9b20b365d2239e7-lq)

As you probably know, members of the horse family generally excel at long-distance running - they’re one of the only animals which are better than humans at it. The key thing about long-distance running which makes it difficult is overheating - as such, horses are also the only animals which sweat as much as we do.

However, what horses have and we don’t is a coat of (albeit short) hair. That makes it hard for the sweat glands to rapidly transport sweat from the skin to the ends of the hairs where it can evaporate. The horses’ solution to this is latherin.

The protein - being a detergent - lathers up the horse hair, living up to its name, wetting them so that water can flow efficiently from the base to the ends, where evaporative cooling occurs.

So, there’s everything about sweaty horses you never wanted to know.

# BIRDS

## The Hummingbird's Heartbeat
    
**Upvotes**: 7,694 | **Comments**: 230 | **Date**: [Sep-22](https://www.quora.com/Which-birds-are-more-strange-than-most-people-realize/answer/Gary-Meaney)

I’m gonna have to go with hummingbirds. You may well have seen some firsthand, and while they are generally considered novel creatures, I don’t think many are aware of just how bizarre they really are.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-da4bee84502c669d0dff08f0a880206b-lq)

First and foremost, there’s their metabolism. Hummingbirds have the fastest metabolic rate of any animal on Earth, except for some insects. Their hearts beat at a positively mind-blowing rate of 1,260 BPM during flight, and even at rest they have to take 250 breaths per minute. For comparison, the average person’s max heart rate and resting breathing rate are 180 and 12–20, respectively.

Having a breakneck metabolism brings with it many, many challenges. To prevent themselves from overheating, many hummingbird have featherless patches under their shoulders, on their wings, and around their eyes, where excess heat can dissipate efficiently.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d6a3db2cf378ef9b6dd7a23ed2644a3f-lq)

That said, if a human were to have the same metabolic rate, despite being wholly hairless, they would surely perish. This is, of course, because we are much, much, much bigger than hummingbirds. In fact, hummingbirds are the world’s smallest birds by far.

In Cuba, you can find the aptly named bee hummingbird, whose size cannot be understated. The males can measure as little as 5 centimetres in length, and weigh a paltry 2 grams. Despite their tininess, bee hummingbirds are quite beautiful.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-353698b587a4624785c14673f8a0f169-lq)

You would think these minuscule birds wouldn’t eat much food, but - bearing in mind their metabolism - that is far from the case. Every day, a typical hummingbird will suck nectar from roughly 2,000 flowers, in addition to eating plenty of small insects, consuming triple their bodyweight in food total. They have to eat once every 10–15 minutes.

They also take in a huge amount of water, up to five times their bodyweight daily. That would be equivalent to me downing more than 1,600 glasses in a single day, i.e. a few glasses in every minute I’m awake. Because of this massive influx of hydration, their kidneys have evolved to precisely filter the levels of water and electrolytes in the body.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-921991d6daf50315f641603f78c1a905-lq)

You might also be wondering how hummingbirds cope with lean times, given that they need so much food just to survive. If there is a shortage of nutrition, they take extreme measures - that is, they enter a hibernation-like state of torpor in order to save energy. The heartbeat slows down to 1/25th of its normal pace, and their body temperature more than halves.

Rather adorably, hummingbirds hang upside down while they are torpid!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0fbb9193705c75dfc5f95c9dab3ba969-lq)

The hummingbird metabolism means that the mitochondria in their cells must produce energy as quickly and efficiently as possible. So, instead of performing glycolysis - breaking glucose down into pyruvic acid and using the resulting free energy to form molecules like ATP - like normal organisms, they have the amazing ability to instantly convert glucose into energy, by simply oxidizing it.

What’s even more interesting is that they can do the same thing to another sugar, fructose. As well as being high in glucose, flower nectar contains plenty of fructose, so by being able to immediately metabolize it they get a lot more fuel out of their food.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9a41e8081bb7a1de4da504251533ee6b-lq)

Speaking of nectar, hummingbirds ingest this sweet liquid using one of the most fascinating tongues in the animal world. This tongue is so long that it coils around the skull when retracted, and has two twin tubes. When the tongue is ejected, the tubes split apart, and a row of flaps unfurls on each side.

Droplets catch on these flaps, which snap shut as the tongue is drawn back into the mouth, trapping the nectar. This repeats in incredibly rapid succession, as the hummingbird flicks their tongue in and out of the flower with a pumping action.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d8c7b70bb6a1468eea154673f2e51801-pjlq)

Another cool adaptation one species has for nectarivory is an absurdly long beak. The sword-billed hummingbird of the Andes has the proportionally longest bill of any bird in the world; at more than 15 cm, it even exceeds the body length.

This allows the species to access flowers which have very deep corollas (petal tubes), which are out of reach to all of their would-be competitors.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cb3b543d3ba70185a28e1edcbc457b39-lq)

While we’re on the topic of odd and novel species of hummingbird, I should also mention a couple of types which have beautiful plumage. Specifically, the long-tailed sylph:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3c3a95d04504065ba1874675dc60ec94-lq)

And the white-booted racket tail:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2bbc73cf248c12447a53c4db25b79f38-lq)

The former has extraordinarily long tail feathers, and the latter has a very interesting sexual display feature. Male racket-tails get their name from the two little oval-shaped flags which trail behind them, used for attracting females. Both sexes also have lovely fluffy pom poms on their legs - hence “white-booted”.

Lastly, hummingbird behaviour is almost as fascinating as their diet and metabolism. Take flight, for example Hummingbirds are perhaps the most skilled aviators in nature (insects aside); their aerial acrobatics are simply jaw-dropping. They can fly in any direction, including backwards and sideways, and can hover on the spot.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f520773924aeadc722121f4220342e95-lq)

To perform these feats, they beat their wings at an unimaginably fast pace of 80 times per second!

Focusing one’s eyes with so much rapid aerial movement is also highly challenging; in order to refine their vision, the optic tract of the hummingbird brain is greatly enlarged. In addition to that, they are tetrachromatic; they have four types of colour receptor cells, in comparison to our three. This enables them to perceive five extra colours which are “invisible” to us humans.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-661f2d0c0205b8e82b7e5c08d5b9208d-lq)

Not only do they have enhanced vision - they appear to have enhanced intelligence, too. Relative to their body size, hummingbirds have the biggest brain of any bird - they account for nearly 5% of the mass, whereas our brains are around 2% of our total body weight.

Of course, we have to keep in mind that this is partially because they’re so small - brain size does not scale directly proportionally to body weight. However, hummingbirds show behavioural signs of intelligence as well: they are one of only three bird groups which have vocal learning abilities, i.e. listening to, imitating and reproducing the sound of others.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e1c896ddfe769379e0064a8f04c89e0e-pjlq)

So, with all that in mind, I’d go so far as to argue that hummingbirds aren’t just stranger than people realize, they’re the strangest birds that have ever lived. Thank you very, very much for sticking around through this long answer, I hope you found it interesting, and have a great day.

## The Bird That Fed the Fish
    
**Upvotes**: 5,094 | **Comments**: 46 | **Date**: [1y](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-review-of-Animal-Behavior/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Here’s one which not a lot of people know about: some birds feed pond fish as if they were their own young.

In 2010, someone filmed a northern cardinal feeding pet goldfish in their garden pond. Allegedly, the bird does this up to six times each day. What on Earth could be going on?

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9989960e20131f2740084f4679922ab3-lq)

It’s not the first time someone has observed this. One photo, probably taken in the early sixties depicts an incredibly similar incident, and has featured in numerous textbooks from the ’60s and ‘70s.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-440e92d33bf0192ee23340424ac5eed4-pjlq)

Other cases I managed to find include this short video of a duckling feeding koi:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-71a50dbba44c78128b221b7df7bb51f1)

Another one of a Brazilian teal with some kind of fish:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f686027fcbb541a2161313a9a76102c6-lq)

And several clips/photos of black swans seemingly feeding koi from China and Taiwan.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e7ab3a91f9cf13e6409f9d2b3ecb94d3-pjlq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2529aadfc781f47bff1803b3b30e5f66-pjlq)

So, are these birds just Good Samaritans looking out for their freshwater friends? Seemingly random acts of kindness aren’t unknown in the animal world - some of you may know of [the lioness who “adopted” a baby oryx.](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-bizarre-animal-behaviors-that-not-many-people-know-about/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")

However, this is likely not the explanation here. Rather, there are two separate explanations. In the last four instances I mentioned, the birds “feeding” the koi were waterfowl, specifically in the family Anatidae. More or less all birds in this family often dip their food in the water, perhaps to make it easier to swallow.

Essentially, the birds are just getting robbed by the fish. Not as heartwarming an explanation as one would hope for, but it doesn’t explain the cardinals…

The best answer to the question of the first two birds is one which has been pointed out by a few people. To a bird, this:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5a079610fa175c887fc6868da2539285-lq)

might look a lot like this:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-209ed4e528b06f9f35a4dfb24c837ebe-lq)

It would appear that the cardinals interpret the gaping, bright red mouths of the goldfish as those of young cardinal chicks. The parental instinct kicks in, and they start feeding the fish.

This is a great example of how adaptations can have “unintended” side effects - in feeding the goldfish, the cardinals are wasting food they could otherwise eat themselves (or, you know, give to their actual kids), so you’d think they and their young would be at a selective disadvantage. However, since populations of cardinals are overall better off with the parental instinct than without, the net result is that the behaviour continues.

## Fancy Pigeons - the Strange and the Spectacular

In my opinion, that honour goes to the domestic pigeon. In the 10,000 years since their domestication, the birds have been selectively bred into countless bizarre forms, collectively known as “fancy pigeons”.

In a way, it saddens me that we’ve practically engineered these natural creatures to suit our strange desires. At least they’re not unhealthy, though - unlike so many poor dogs, especially purebreds.

## The Most Counter-Intuitive Dance Routine
    
**Upvotes**: 946 | **Comments**: 14 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-bizarre-mating-rituals-in-birds/answer/Gary-Meaney)

The blue-backed manakin has a fascinating, and indeed counter-intuitive, courtship ritual. In almost all animals, when the male tries to impress the female, he does so competitively. Blue-backed manakins, on the other hand, do this cooperatively.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a2a592f02e4c755bf514a387d75ecb26-lq)

Several males, which are blue and black with a bright red cap, line up on a twig in view of a female. They then perform a dance together, with one on the far side hopping up, and then fluttering to the back of the line. They all take turns in this way.

The result is a courtship display much more impressive than one which is performed solo, but the question remains - since only one will get to mate, why do the others cooperate? At the end of the day, it could be any of them who the female selects, so by teaming up they increase everybody’s chances.

Sometimes, it’s better to work together - even with your fiercest competitors.

## When China Went to War on Sparrows, and Lost
    
**Upvotes**: 797 | **Comments**: 22 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-strangest-conflict-between-humans-and-animals-in-history/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Everyone knows about the Great Emu War, so I’m going to go for a slightly lesser-known event; the Four Pests Campaign, an effort to prevent famine which ended up causing the largest, deadliest famine in recorded history.

* * *

In 1949, the People’s Republic of China was founded by Mao Zedong, after a period of civil war. Nine years later, in 1958, Zedong launched the famous, but doomed, social campaign known as the Great Leap Forward. Through this, he aimed to increase China’s economy and industry, transforming it from a rural, agricultural nation to a thriving communist society.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5534577dcdd04f11e7992f1c235d42e4-lq)

“Backyard furnaces”, used to produce steel in the Great Leap Forward.

One of the first actions taken in this Leap was known as the Four Pests Campaign. It was so named because it sought to eradicate four unwanted types of animals - flies, which carried typhoid, mosquitoes, which carried malaria, rats, which carried the plague, and - most famously - sparrows.

The first three seem like understandable choices, but why sparrows? The government, at the time, believed that Eurasian tree sparrows ate crops such as rice and grain, though in truth their effect on production was more or less negligible. They were also thought of as “public animals of capitalism”, so there’s that.

Through propaganda such as the posters above, the populace were convinced that sparrows were vile birds, to be exterminated. The results were… quite remarkable. Many took up arms and shot them out of the sky on sight. The unarmed would bang pots and pans whenever they saw sparrows resting on branches, in a (somewhat futile) effort to kill them by exhaustion.

One day, an alleged force of 3 million citizens marched through Beijing, on the hunt for the feathered vermin. When the city’s Polish Embassy refused to let them enter to scare away the sparrows, it was surrounded by drumming protestors, non-stop, for 2 days. As you’ve probably guessed, all this was not good for the sparrow population.

By 1960, the Eurasian tree sparrow was nearly extinct in China, less than two years after the launch of the Four Pests Campaign. However, the influential ornithologist Tso-hsin Cheng managed to convince Chinese leaders to end the sparrow eradication, pointing out that they were important predators of insects. Mao replaced sparrows with bed bugs, but the damage had been done.

With no sparrows to keep them in check, locust populations exploded. They swarmed the country, demolishing crops like the birds never could. This plague of locusts was the nail in the coffin, adding to a perfect storm of factors - all results of Zedong’s Great Leap Forward - and causing the Great Chinese Famine.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-42eede31d3a1f6e12681843d51065d22-lq)

This famine, lasting from 1959–1961, was the worst period of starvation in recorded human history. While the Chinese government dubiously reported 15 million casualties, other estimates conclude that at least 45 million people died.

For the poor of China during this time, life would have been hell on Earth. Villages and roadsides were littered with corpses, and pets had disappeared from most settlements - guess why. One man, according to a well-known Dutch historian, was force-fed excrement for stealing a fellow villager’s sweet potato. As in potato, singular.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-95657d5349b79a818e0a948959012f1c)

During the Great Chinese Famine, the birth rate in the country dropped to lower than it had ever been (before the one-child policy). The government tried desperately to cover up the devastation from Mao, assembling fake lush fields of grain when he visited agricultural regions.

In addition to the tens of millions which starved, millions more were beaten or tortured to death, and millions more again committed suicide. And all this because of the misguided actions of one man, trying to advance his country.

## Four Bizarre Birds' Nests, Explored
    
**Upvotes**: 640 | **Comments**: 10 | **Date**: [Updated 2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-amazing-bird-nests-that-occur-in-nature/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Birds’ nests are a lot more diverse and amazing than most people realize. When I say the word “bird’s nest”, you probably think of a small, bowl-shaped arrangement of twigs. Yet they are so much more varied.

Sociable weavers build incredible colonial nests. They are small, brown birds which are found in Southern Africa. Weavers are so named because of their iconic hanging nests, but the nests of this species are on another level altogether.

These are enormous, multitonne masses of straw, larger than any other bird’s nest. The many chambers found within can support hundreds of weavers, and are also used by many other species of bird, and even snakes and lizards.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-18eca88dbd615d84176f1a880718cd3b-lq)

In some cases, the weavers will build their nests on utility poles. These look even more bizarre than the ones built in trees, and have been known to cause short circuits!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-83341990e6b55de19a9477648ef280e8-pjlq)

Some sociable weaver nests are thought to have been continuously inhabited for over a century. However, the gyrfalcon scoffs at this. The largest species of falcon, this polar raptor does not build a nest out of twigs, but rather scrapes itself one into a rocky cliff face.

One gyrfalcon nest in Greenland was determined - via carbon dating - to be in the region of 2,500 years old! On the same cliff, the very youngest of nests were at least 500 years old. Based on the analysis, the falcon’s nest could have first been clawed out of the rock while Babylon was the largest city in the world.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dda380323bb4c1853e081df9e4ee7f4c-lq)

Another strange type of bird nest is that used by the megapodes. Megapodes are a family of gamebirds found east of the Wallace Line, except for in some islands in the Bay of Bengal. They are so named for their very large feet, which are used instead of an egg tooth to emerge from the egg at birth.

Megapodes are very lazy when it comes to parenting, and since sitting on a nest for weeks is an awful lot of trouble, they instead build enormous, dome-shaped mounds out of leaf litter or volcanic ash, which naturally incubate the eggs. Look at the size of this one.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9a69e3f98600f241301823ceb4f55c3e-lq)

Lastly, I’ll mention the bizarre nests which many swiftlets construct. Swiftlets are swallow-like birds related to hummingbirds, and a variety of them - most famously the edible-nest swiftlet - make their nests out of their own saliva.

White and translucent, they are built on cliffs and are formed entirely by the mother’s solidified spit. In China, these nests are actually prized as a delicacy, because they are rich in flavour and protein. The saliva is used to make the ancient Chinese dish known as birds-nest soup.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7038982718e43407036c856b655f4f0a-lq)

So, those are the four bird nests which I find are the most amazing. The nesting world is so much more than the standard “cup” type which we all know. Thanks for reading!

## The Barnacle Goose and the Goose Barnacle
    
**Upvotes**: 631 | **Comments**: 32 | **Date**: [1y](https://www.quora.com/Before-the-discovery-of-unknown-continents-how-did-people-explain-migratory-birds-disappearing-each-year-for-6-months/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Excellent question! The answer - spontaneous generation.

Spontaneous generation was first thought up in deep ancient times, likely originating in Greece in the 6th Century BC, and it persisted until the 1800s. Essentially, it was the idea that many organisms are born not from other organisms, but from nonliving matter.

Eels were said to come from riverbed mud, maggots from rotting flesh, scallops from sand and so on. Essentially, this was early philosophers’ and scientists’ way of explaining births which they had never, and could not have, observed. There is at least one instance of this being used to explain the origin of a migratory bird.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-25fba9a977105426fd420a74facd1bda-lq)

Above is a species of waterfowl called the barnacle goose, which is found chiefly in Europe and North America. As you’ll come to see, it isn’t named after barnacles, the crustaceans - rather, it’s the other way around.

Every summer, barnacle geese migrate to the Arctic to breed. As the far north was inaccessible and inhospitable to Medieval Europeans, in their eyes the birds simply disappeared for 6 months every year. So, they invoked spontaneous generation to explain how baby barnacle geese are made.

One popular belief was that they came from driftwood:

> They are produced from fir timber tossed along the sea, and are at first like gum. Afterwards they hang down by their beaks as if they were a seaweed attached to the timber, and are surrounded by shells in order to grow more freely. Having thus in process of time been clothed with a strong coat of feathers, they either fall into the water or fly freely away into the air.

The above was written by a Medieval Welsh author, Giraldus Cambrensis, who documented the natural history of Ireland. Read further in his account and it becomes clear what these “baby birds” really were:

> They derived their food and growth from the sap of the wood or from the sea, by a secret and most wonderful process of alimentation. I have frequently seen, with my own eyes, more than a thousand of these small bodies of birds, hanging down on the sea-shore from one piece of timber, enclosed in their shells, and already formed. They do not breed and lay eggs like other birds, nor do they ever hatch any eggs, nor do they seem to build nests in any corner of the earth.

Yes, Cambrensis is in fact talking about barnacles, which get their name from this belief. Unsurprisingly, it’s also why members of the order Pedunculata (a subset of the barnacles) are known as goose barnacles. To be fair, goose barnacles do have rather goose-like “necks” and “beaks”.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d0d256ccb1ff5a3bfee6e99548c632ce-lq)

Now, the idea that these geese were grown-up barnacles had some unexpected implications, especially when it comes to food laws.

Here in Ireland, many priests sneakily argued that barnacle geese could therefore be eaten during Lent and other fast days, as actual barnacles were allowed. Some Christians criticized this, however, and eventually Pope Innocent III established that barnacle geese could not be eaten during Lent.

* * *

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c5c3f0bccbdab3cc068c3b029e2aa95c-lq)

So, long story short - they believed that migratory birds were born as goose barnacles which spawned from driftwood or trees.

## The Bare-Faced Go-Away and Other Turacos
    
**Upvotes**: 317 | **Comments**: 14 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-cool-birds/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Deciding on just one is very hard, but for this answer I’ll go with turacos. They’re so little known, and yet so fascinating.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-93f515ed688b33402b35885966c33890-pjlq)

The turacos form the order of birds called Musophagiformes (meaning “banana eaters”), which has only one family, Musophagidae, which contains 23 living species. They are only found in sub-Saharan Africa, although fossil evidence shows that they once lived in places like France, Germany and Egypt.

They are interesting for many reasons. For one thing, they’re the only birds which have green pigmentation. Of course, there are other birds which look green, but they can only pull that off using something called structural colour - they have microscopic structures in their feathers which reflect only green light. For some reason, actual green pigments are very rare in animals, but turacos have managed to synthesize them.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-54d938f20751c56dd8358a8ab182055e-lq)

Another pigment unique to the family is turacin (guess where the name comes from), which gives them their beautiful red wing feathers. It’s the sun shining through these red wings which make them stand out when flying overhead:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a9fb769d4dc1b7c54ba8ca30eef8e405-lq)

There are three main types of turaco - “regular” turacos - brightly coloured birds which dwell in tropical rainforests - plantain-eaters, and go-away birds. The latter two aren’t as extravagant as their relatives - mainly sporting grey, black and white plumage - and are found in savannahs and dry woodlands.

Go-away birds are named for their calls, which start out like “kweh, kweh, kweh” then move on to squeaky “go-way”s, before ending in a long drawl. The bare-faced go-away bird (pictured below) is probably the most colourful in this group - grey and white with a black face and a greenish patch on the breast.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8d946b111c856d4de4a6c4569b3d2ab3-lq)

The largest species of turaco is the great blue turaco, found in Kenya, Uganda, and the DR Congo. Up to 76 centimetres long, it’s highly sought-after by birders for its beauty and vivid colours.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b9b1a2add17c5238991ec21f4e86bcd6-lq)

All turacos have a unique foot structure which allows them to literally run along branches through the forest canopy, in a method of locomotion unique among birds. The fourth toe is very flexible, so it can twist back to the back toe (making an X shape with the other digits), or forward to the front two (making a typical, trident-shaped foot).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e4ca36294a194fb7c189a7cc7ed8391a-pjlq)

Lastly, juvenile turacos have a rather amazing trait which really shows how similar birds are to other dinosaurs. While almost all other birds have lost their fingers over the course of evolution, young musophagids retain a tiny little clawed digit on their wings, which they use to climb trees (The unrelated hoatzin is similar). When they grow up, they’re safer from predators and less in need of quick escapes, so they lose the claws.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4b3c1bc8bd1b91e71bf32e96b17b2828-lq)

So, that’s been the turacos - the uniquely-pigmented, weird-footed, treetop-running, claw-winged oddballs of Africa. Hopefully you’ve enjoyed this answer, thank you for reading.

## The Horrifying World of Birds with Teeth
    
**Upvotes**: 289 | **Comments**: 9 | **Date**: [1y](https://www.quora.com/Can-birds-have-fangs/answer/Gary-Meaney)

In a way, yes. One of the many adaptations raptors have to help them in their carnivorous lifestyle is a pair of structures known as tomial teeth. These are little pointed serrations on the tomium - that is, the cutting edge of the beak.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5b09b231f95eec3063396c8ae51f7d53-lq)

Interestingly enough, it’s not just birds of prey which have these cutting fangs. You may have heard of a family of macabre little birds known as the shrikes…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-48acc768e32216b5f0afe94136b012fa-lq)

They belong to the most diverse bird order; the passerines, or perching birds. Your typical passerine would be a plump little feathered friend which eats seeds, worms and insects - think robins, sparrows, finches and the like. Not shrikes.

They’ve evolved into carnivores, and are infamous for impaling their prey on natural spikes (as seen above) as a means of caching the food for later. When they do eat the victims, they do it with their strong, hooked beak - and their tomial teeth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b15fe0d2d2fc4aabb49e58df68f30643-lq)

There are other kinds of toothy birds, however. Members of the Anatidae family, such as ducks and geese, have comb-like structures called pectens lining the inside of their bill, which are used to strain food from water. Kudos to geese for going the extra horrifying mile and slapping some pectens on their tongues.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3b3e95aa8737347be944b63c253472ec-lq)

(This is one of the numerous reasons why you shouldn’t ever kiss a goose.)

Then there’s another type of structure, similar to the pecten: the papilla, found in a variety of birds. Penguins, for example, possess lingual papillae; rows of spines on their tongue which help dice up fish.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-15cde4540c8b17c280d20fad3c5690de-lq)

A more widespread version of these would be choanal papillae, found on the palate of many a bird. These are triangular, backwards-facing structures which line the two sides of what’s known as the choanal slit.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0fa54dfb7e5bbd8ad3f8a8b039c6d030-pjlq)

So, there’s a smorgasbord of vaguely fang-like bits and bobs which lurk in the mouths of avians. Thank you for reading eight paragraphs of me ruining birds you thought were cute, and have a nice day.

## The Avian Artists of Australia
    
**Upvotes**: 286 | **Comments**: 6 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/Do-animals-monkeys-dolphins-dogs-etc-have-their-own-sense-of-what-is-physically-beautiful-and-what-is-ugly/answer/Gary-Meaney)

One of the most fascinating families of birds is Ptilonorhynchidae - the bowerbirds. Found only in Australia and Papua New Guinea, there are many interesting things about them - from the way they [rub their wings with ants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anting_(bird_activity)#History "en.wikipedia.org") to their [catfishing habits](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a816683/planet-earth-bird-catfished-heart-david-attenborough-narrates/ "www.digitalspy.com"). But here, I’ll talk about how they seem to have an aesthetic sense.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fcab61c5c2ba976bc1c5b9bf15d4cfd8-lq)

Bowerbirds are best-known for their unique courtship strategy, where the male builds a structure (bower) out of sticks (usually avenue-shaped as pictured above, but some species have roofed, hut-like bowers, and one builds no bower at all). This is then decorated with colorful trinkets. This mating behaviour demonstrates an aesthetic sense in a few ways.

First of all, the birds colour-code their displays. They place all their red objects in one area, all their blue ones in another, and so on. Some males will only collect things of a single colour (often blue for satin bowerbirds, or grey/white for great bowerbirds). All this indicates that the females find this visually and aesthetically pleasing.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4d969704127095518a40b87e142da727-lq)

Secondly, some species understand perspective. Male great bowerbirds (the largest species of bowerbird) usually arrange the displays so that the largest objects are at the back and the smallest at the front. Thus, when a female enters the avenue of the bower, all the objects appear the same size - presumably also aesthetically pleasing.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b4a2c5893d8c00fe8431b76fad0ae707-lq)

Why certain things simply look satisfying is somewhat mysterious even in humans, but what does make sense is why the males work so hard (arranging their collections of hundreds of objects for hours on end) to seduce the females and pass on their genes.

# REPTILES and AMPHIBIANS

## The Rectangular Toad And Its Gruesome Birth
    
**Upvotes**: 3,069 | **Comments**: 83 | **Date**: [Nov-23](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-ugliest-animal-in-the-Amazon-forest/answer/Gary-Meaney)

With hundreds of thousands of Amazonian species to choose from, this was a tricky one, but I have resolved to nominate the common Surinam toad. What constitutes ugliness is of course a subjective concept, but this amphibian sure won’t be winning any conventional beauty contests.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7f500f29764e790f185f5976a56bf9f7-lq)

The common Surinam toad is a rather rectangular creature found across the Amazon basin. Its tiny eyeballs and muddy brown colour don’t do it many aesthetic favours, but when the females start to give birth, things get really ugly.

During mating, the female releases eggs, which the male fertilizes and embeds in her skin. These eggs gradually sink deeper and deeper into their mother’s back, eventually forming a scattering of pits. While they develop, she has the strange pockmarked appearance pictured above. Then things get weirder still.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-571e9fed43fd2e8d8477aa41678aba4a-lq)

After the eggs hatch, the newborn tadpoles stay inside their pockets, eventually growing into fully formed adult toads. They all crawl out of their mother at this stage, in a gooey exodus. Finally, the mother sheds the honeycombed layer of skin off her back in place of a fresh one.

While the common Surinam toad may indeed be ugly, you can’t deny that it is equally fascinating, for a number of reasons in addition to what I just described. Uniquely, these toads do not croak; rather, the males produce rapid, throaty clicks with their tongue bone. Funnily enough, they don’t have actual tongues.

Another cool feature of this species are the tiny star-shaped growths they have on their toes, used for gripping slippery prey. You can see them in the photo below if you look closely.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ab010e0c5b81ad633c51fd516a9f36ad-pjlq)

Anyway, thank you very much for reading everybody. Apologies for my recent lack of activity - I’ve been quite busy recently, but I sure don’t plan on stopping any time soon. I hope you enjoyed the answer, and have a great day.

## Frogs and Their Incredible Skeletons
    
**Upvotes**: 2,946 | **Comments**: 79 | **Date**: [8mo](https://www.quora.com/What-animal-has-an-unexpected-skeletal-shape/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Surprisingly, I’d have to go with frogs. They might seem boring at a glance, but frogs are one of the weirdest land vertebrate groups there are - thanks in part to their insane reproductive biology, but also due to their skeletons.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b01691467192ba5e9c426228af6f33bd-lq)

First of all, there’s the fact that their skeletons have been drastically “simplified”. Most of the components of the skull have fused together into a single structure called the frontoparietal, and the spine may contain as little as five vertebrae. No species has more than nine.

Frogs have also discarded all the teeth on the lower jaw - except for one species, actually. Incredibly, Guenther’s marsupial frog from South America seems to have completely re-evolved lower teeth, unlike any other frog. Also, females have an egg pouch on their back, hence “marsupial”:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-51f6ab65957451ae702301d332eb8385-pjlq)

A different, related species of marsupial frog is pictured above, but it’s the same concept. Oh yeah, their eggs are also the largest of any amphibians, and the babies skip the tadpole phase. Didn’t I tell you frogs were really weird?

Alas, I’m getting sidetracked - back to the skeleton. The ribs of frogs have been reduced to stubs, called “transverse processes”, or have disappeared altogether in some species. One hypothesis is that this is due to the way they move - by hopping on their belly. Repeatedly landing on their ribs would be damaging to the bones.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6b7168bdb64f2fbe0997b734e574e2e0-lq)

So, because their ribs are so tiny, frogs can’t breathe by expanding and contracting the chest, like other vertebrates. Instead, they respire by pumping their throats, as the inside of their mouth is lined with capillary blood vessels for gas exchange. They also breathe partially through their skin.

Other examples of the frog skeleton being “simplified” include the forelegs and shoulder girdle, which are each fused amalgamations of smaller bones. The pelvis bone is also really, really weird; it has this bizarre trident shape, and it’s longer than the entire spine!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-57bad56766e07f295231319599106627-pjlq)

Another really odd thing is that that stick of bone in the middle of the “trident”, the urostyle, is actually what’s left of a tail. Based on studies of embryos, the tail vertebrae of frogs’ ancestors have slowly retracted and been absorbed into the bony sheath of the spine.

Lastly, I’ll talk about the hands and feet. Each frog forelimb has four digits, but in the males of many species, there appears to be five. This fifth “toe” is a mysterious, spike-like structure called the prepollex, or pseudothumb. It’s usually used either in combat or to grip females during mating.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-245eac0b931030e660e0f1b3a914f698-pjlq)

Also, you can’t mention froggy toes without giving the hairy frog a shoutout. Nicknamed the Wolverine frog, this unique species from the rainforests of Central Africa is famous for its amazing defense mechanism.

When threatened, the hairy frog can snap its toe bones at will. The jagged shards jut out through the skin, and can be used to maim attackers. Of course, the species is even more well-known for its “hair”; filaments of skin, or dermal papillae, which sprout along the flanks of males during the breeding season.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9467f3da6bf4ae7eaa9fe28163548d06-lq)

Alas, I’d better finish up now before I find myself fallen into another info-dump rabbit hole - or should I say ribbit hole? In fact, writing that painful joke made me want to go on another tangent about how only one species of frog (the Pacific tree frog) actually says “ribbit” and it became the stereotypical frog noise because that species lives near Hollywood, California.

See what I mean? Anyway, thanks everyone for reading. I hope you aren’t too bored by me talking at length about the bones of amphibians. Have a great day!

## The Creature That Devours Its Mother's Skin
    
**Upvotes**: 2,457 | **Comments**: 109 | **Date**: [Jan-15](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-weirdest-kind-of-amphibian/answer/Gary-Meaney)

There are a handful of possible answers to this question, but for me, the answer is clear: caecilians. Most people have heard of two of the main amphibian groups: the anurans (frogs) and the caudates (salamanders). However, unbeknownst to many, there is a third - and extremely bizarre - group, known as the caecilians.

They’ve popped up in my answers a few time before, but I’ve never written about them in as much detail as they deserve; a predicament which I intend to remedy today.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-664f6161bd4d44dadb77def497be016a-lq)

The nearly 200 species of caecilian are distributed across most of the world’s tropical rainforests. Their most obvious stand-out feature is, of course, the complete absence of legs - they have an almost earthworm-like appearance. That said, some species can get quite a lot bigger than your typical worm - one specimen was measured to be two metres in length!

All along this length are folds of skin called annuli, another conspicuous hallmark. Though this skin may appear soft and squishy, it hides an embedded armour of subcutaneous scales, which are made of calcite. The skin also has another line of defense: toxic secretions. These can be highly effective - touching the secretions of one species, Boettger’s caecilian, is known to induce severe hemolysis (rupturing of red blood cells).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d6f903be1a010bf1091e449ddc1b050f-lq)

Continuing this dermal theme, I am obligated to mention a fascinating behaviour seen in a select handful of caecilian species: maternal dermatophagy, or skin-feeding. When they have newborn young, these animals grow a new, fatty layer of skin, around their existing body.

The babies then start gnawing away at this exceptionally nutritious source of food, which is regenerated every few days. The whole skin-feeding process lasts about a week, during which time the caecilian’s offspring increase tenfold in size. It may seem grotesque, but it’s a pretty comparable survival strategy to lactation in mammals.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9f2181764ab0af8efdba22191d14bbae-lq)

What’s more, those aren’t the only weird caecilian babies. Some members of the family Typhlonectidae are born with a huge set, or sets, of frilly gills sprouting out of their head. Stranger still, the larvae shed them almost instantly after birth, breathing instead with their skin.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b2efcae9c1319a7984dfec7501e280a5-pjlq)

The typhlonectids are a very interesting family for many other reasons. Unlike most of their relatives, which are burrowing creatures, they are aquatic, and many species are entirely restricted to their underwater habitat. They have a long, paddle-like fin running along their tail which allows them to swim in an undulating, eel-like manner.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eba02ecf39e55c253828569107536b8f-lq)

The most famous of the typhlonectids is probably Atretochoana eiselti, which is notorious for its rather… well… unusual resemblance to something else. What it ought to be known for, on the other hand, is the fact that it it doesn’t have any lungs!

It’s unique among caecilians in this regard, and is also the world’s largest lungless tetrapod by an enormous margin. Its skin is packed to the rafters with blood capillaries, allowing it to breathe and sustain such impressive mass without any complex organ systems.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d5de9ab6cbbc315e26648830d0e5ae62-lq)

While Atretochoana and its relatives sport very dull, greyish, brownish or purplish hues, it’s worth noting that other caecilians are a lot more vibrant and colourful. They can be bright yellow:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-22027883606a3673b41e6e43ca2a8dde-lq)

Orange:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-387f2d7127b053878b993507da91ec03-pjlq)

Or electric blue:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-11e438920df5989676b871b051adca92-lq)

These palettes are likely an example of aposematism: bright colours which advertise to would-be predators that the animal is poisonous, venomous, unpalatable, spiny or otherwise undesirable. They are not - as far as we know - a sexual display feature meant for other caecilians, because these creatures are practically blind.

Caecilian eyes are quite primitive, capable only of distinguishing between light and dark, not of forming images. They are burrowing animals, after all, and good vision is not much of an advantage for this lifestyle. Hence, the eyes are tiny, sometimes even completely covered by skin.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-537d2bde3255a28dc74ebf81cba069b3-pjlq)

That being said, caecilians have other, much more acute sensory organs - the most bizarre of which being their tentacles. Yes, just behind the nostrils, they have a pair of minuscule tendrils, only perceptible if you look closely. Their precise mechanism is not really known, but it’s reasonable to assume that they are used to smell things, perhaps augmenting the regular olfactory system.

The tentacle in the photo below is that pale, tooth-like projection, if you’re having trouble spotting it.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0523e4b2f6eb8aaf1ea1bfc2d77be45d-lq)

Below the tentacles is, of course, the mouth, which has plenty of weird stuff going on. Caecilian teeth are translucent, frighteningly sharp, and often arranged in multiple rows, adapted for chomping through their earthworm prey. Furthermore, there is a species - the ringed caecilian - has a set of glands in its dentition which may in fact secret venom! This would make it the world’s only known venomous amphibian.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b825f5dab0fd92ef8e10179712464c6-lq)

What’s even more interesting to me than their teeth, however, is how they bite with them. The musculature surrounding the caecilian jaw is extraordinarily complex, containing muscles which have not been found in any other organism on Earth. This is because, unlike all other vertebrate species, they have two separate systems of muscles used for closing the jaw.

In addition to the normal set of jaw muscles, which simply contract to pull the mandible bone upwards, they have a second array which push down on the posterior section of the bone, causing the front part to lift up in a seesaw-like motion. It’s one of those biological quirks which probably doesn’t interest the average person but is fascinating to people like me.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-91fec332ac57fb9972c6cbb1fecbee27-pjlq)

In case you’re wondering, this intricate feature is an adaptation which allows caecilians to bite with greater force, especially in a gaping position in which the jaw muscles would otherwise be at much less of a mechanical advantage.

* * *

Now, I finally have an answer which does this wonderfully peculiar group of amphibians justice. Thank you very much everyone for reading; I hope you found some of this interesting, and that you all have a great day.

## The Treacherous Tactics of the Tentacled Snake
    
**Upvotes**: 2,331 | **Comments**: 16 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-animal-has-the-coolest-hunting-tactics/answer/Gary-Meaney)

I nominate the tentacled snake. This bizarre-looking serpent dwells in lakes, streams and rice paddies in Southeast Asia, and it gets its name from the strange pair of sensory structures which protrude from its snout.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-179cdca2f7c93705f81ab086a5e6c8d4-lq)

However, its hunting behaviour is something which is often overlooked. Here’s how it works:

The tentacled snake will lie, often semi-buried in the sediment, with its body in a “J” shape, using its tail to anchor it to the bottom. They can do this for up to half an hour without coming up for air, and may not ever venture on to the land.

When unsuspecting fish swim by, the snake will exploit a trademark of fish biology, using what’s usually one of their most important adaptations to its advantage.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-93b804e041b39e4300d9b3a23029a622-lq)

When the fish enters striking range, the tentacled snake shifts part of its body slightly, creating vibrations in the water. The vibrations are detected by the fish’s Mauthner cells - a pair of large neurons - which in turn trigger an incredibly fast escape reflex known as the C-start response.

The C-start is so named because it makes the fish’s body contort into a “C” shape, propelling it away. It is highly effective against most predators, but the tentacled snake has learned to combat it.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-abd130aadf945774c5a43d5b8943a390-lq)

Because the head is perpendicular to the part of the body where the twitch came from, the fish moves to escape in the wrong direction, and - instead of following its motion like any other predator would - the tentacled snake anticipates its position in advance, catching it before it can straighten out and complete the C-start.

This amazing predictive ability is not something which must be learned, it seems, as experiments have been done on laboratory-born tentacled snakes and they can execute the strike with perfect anticipation too. Thus, this is likely an innate behaviour, hardwired into their nervous system.

## The Earless Dragon of Borneo
    
**Upvotes**: 1,341 | **Comments**: 25 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-reptile-species-do-you-find-most-interesting-and-why/answer/Gary-Meaney)

For me, I have a few, but one of them would be the earless monitor lizard. It’s not quite a monitor lizard as its name suggests, but is the only species in its own separate family, Lanthanotidae. It looks a bit like a lizard trying to be a dinosaur from an old 19th-century reconstruction.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-690bfb2a28d870255fdf66515c6904e9-lq)

Another misnomer in their name is “earless” - they can hear, though they lack an eardrum and don’t even have ear openings, hence the genus name Lanthanotus (meaning “hidden ear”). Their eyes are also greatly reduced, and at a glance are hard to spot at all. This is unusual as their relatives the monitors have excellent vision.

Found only in Borneo, the earless monitor lizard is a semi-aquatic creature found in tropical rainforests, and is rarely seen far from water. It also has a prehensile tail which can wrap around branches, allowing it to climb adeptly. Studies have shown that, like some of their close relatives, lanthanotids have a venomous bite.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c4ce0dc94f3aab9a05fed935a93d2066-lq)

Interestingly enough, earless monitors have been known to shed their skin in one piece, rather than in flakes, which is something only seen in snakes, not other lizards. Additionally, they have snake-like forked tongues, frog-like throat pouches, and they make squeaking noises.

Unfortunately, this species is poached as it is popular with exotic animal collectors. However, it’s so poorly understood that we do not yet know what its conservation status is. It could be endangered for all we know.

## Stilettos for Teeth and Spiders for Tails
    
**Upvotes**: 842 | **Comments**: 13 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-interesting-historical-or-contemporary-snake-species/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Glad you asked, these kind of questions are my thing. I nominate the following.

*   The spider-tailed horned viper. This species’ bizarre-looking tail has evolved to mimic a spider; strange, elongated scales give the impression of legs. Insectivorous birds see the “spider”, thinking it a prospective meal, and are snapped up by the viper.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-027874487e5923bc651b2b3bdec93575-lq)

*   The tentacled snake. The most striking feature of these aquatic snakes are the twin “tentacles” on its snout, unique to this species. They are in fact sensory equipment, used to detect the movements of fish in the water. Their hunting strategy is fascinating, too, but too complex to explain in a single bullet.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-179cdca2f7c93705f81ab086a5e6c8d4-lq)

*   The tiger keelback. Perhaps someone has corrected you smugly that snakes are venomous, not poisonous. Most of the time that’s true, except for this species. The keelback eats poisonous toads and sequesters their irritating toxin, keeping it in glands on their neck and thus being poisonous. Oh, and they’re venomous too.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4ed5e910c6b8011e32b9a89814cbb7f2-lq)

*   The stiletto snake. This family of serpents has a bizarre skull anatomy, particularly in the fangs - they are angled in such a way that they do not stab downwards, but sideways. Furthermore, they can do this with their mouths closed! The arrangement makes them difficult for scientists to handle.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-30cc3cf94e6f0a5d86069b54cdff9e85-lq)

*   The flying snake. Not exactly obscure, but fascinating nonetheless - these members of the Chrysopelea genus are able to flatten out their ribs, leap out of trees, and glide for up to 100 metres, making them the best gliders in the animal kingdom.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c8c6cf13db1cc4cbdda820ff1d687423-lq)

*   The elephant trunk snake. This species is weird for a number reasons - for one thing, its grey skin is baggy and loose, hence the name. Secondly, they have no scales on their belly, meaning they can’t move outside water. Third, what scales they do have are sharp and rough, and used to attach to fish as the snakes eats them.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-85676e16fae2f15540720f88be610823-lq)

*   The emerald tree boa. Outwardly, it looks perfectly normal, and indeed it is a well-known species. However, when it opens its mouth, it reveals its monstrous teeth - the largest of any snake, for its size. These are an adaptation for hunting mammals and birds in the trees.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-463519e91efe99513c43206721381f38-lq)

*   Since you’re including past snakes, Palaeophiidae. This extinct family survived the end-Cretaceous extinction and lasted until 33 million years ago. They were fully marine, and warm-blooded - they probably gave live birth, too. Worst of all, the largest species, Palaeophis colossaeus, was over 9 metres long - I’d rather take my chances with Titanoboa, thanks.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d0a7368d721814bc18b29797cc85f63d-lq)

So there you have it - 8 slithering proofs that snakes are a lot more diverse than the average person likely thinks.

## Potty-Training a Prehistoric Terror
    
**Upvotes**: 527 | **Comments**: 29 | **Date**: [1y](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-smartest-reptile/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Aside from birds? That’s hard to tell. Some crocodylians have complex social structures, use tools or hunt in packs. Some turtles have been observed to be adept at solving mazes, while giant tortoises exhibit impressive learning skills. However, we have most evidence for intelligence in reptiles with the monitor lizards.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ab6f20470ab2c06111f06e7c7edcc02a-lq)

Monitors are a diverse family of over seventy species, found in southern Asia and most of Africa and Australia. The largest (and most well-known) species is the 3-metre long Komodo dragon of Indonesia, while the smallest is the 23-centimetre Dampier Peninsula monitor of Australia. Most are carnivorous, but a few Filipino species eat fruit.

There’s a pretty good selection of evidence suggesting that they are very smart for reptiles, including:

*   An experiment on captive rock monitors (pictured) which suggests they can count up to six. The lizards were repeatedly presented with two compartments, each containing four snails. Then, they removed a snail in the first compartment, and - instead of moving on - the lizards searched for the missing morsel in confusion. This worked for treats of up to six snails.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b7d51e2a7adaa8e4e15b489eecab5f99-lq)

*   In one instance, a Nile monitor in Kruger was observed to actively corral fish into a dead end. In a shallow pool of water, it would whoosh the fish into an inlet on the fringes where they’d have to leap over its body to escape. As they did so, the lizard would catch the fish in its jaws. This is a novel and creative hunting strategy, also seen in Merten’s water monitor of Australia.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eee3d7fc962196c85a7887941474241e-pjlq)

*   The same species, which inhabits most of Africa, has been twice documented hunting cooperatively in pairs. In both cases, one of the monitors aggravated a mother Nile crocodile, luring her away and into the water. Meanwhile, the second lizard dug up the croc’s nest, and the first one returned so they could both feed on the eggs. Apparently, bird’s nests have also been raided by Nile monitors in this fashion .

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-267b6b769e0f95c7ec1b229a83bf7d35-lq)

*   In captivity, Komodo dragons have a wide range of behaviours typically associated with intelligent animals. Individuals have distinct personalities, and recognize the faces of their keepers. Additionally, they’re one of the only reptiles which have been seen at play - in zoos, they often play with objects such as shovels, buckets, shoes, or specially-made toys for enrichment.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3eb618f166ee5fd53a519ea8d5135cbe-lq)

*   Lastly, captive monitors can be trained almost like dogs. This ranges from basic things, like eating out of their owner’s hand, to much more impressive feats like toilet-training, walking with a dog leash or even tricks. One YouTuber trained their savannah monitor to wave his foreleg when he wanted something. I also found another user who is training his lizard to hunt rats.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9f31fd1a7b268fd0d6f826e69f8225da-lq)

So, with all this evidence in mind, I’m convinced that monitor lizards are quite possibly the most intelligent type of reptile. This is yet another example of brain size being deceptive, as, relative to the size of their bodies, monitors have very small brains.

## A Biological Paradox in the Brazilian Jungle
    
**Upvotes**: 314 | **Comments**: 3 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-animal-has-the-weirdest-life-cycle/answer/Gary-Meaney)

A lot of great answers here, but I’ll chime in with the paradoxical frog, Pseudis paradoxa. To give a bit of background, this frog is a creature which inhabits South America, especially the Amazon basin and the great Pantanal wetland. While technically in the tree frog family, it spends most of its time in the water.

Here’s an adult P. paradoxa:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9e5b74344bb8be1e7a1e53ca8fcfde97-lq)

Overall, it looks fairly standard for a frog. They usually measure around 4.5 to 6.5 centimetres in length, occasionally pushing 7.5. Again, fairly standard dimensions. The female frog will lay her eggs in some water plants, and eventually they’ll hatch as tadpoles.

But these are no ordinary tadpoles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b7fa1f482227c4927cfeb9e15074808f-lq)

They’re absolutely giant - 22–25 centimetres long! Now, they’re not the biggest tadpoles - huge larvae are typical of the Pseudis genus - but what’s really amazing is their size compared to the adults. They’re 3–4 times longer.

So, when these pollywogs metamorphose, they gradually decrease in size until they’re a quarter of their original length! It’s this incredible life history which has earned the species the alternative name of “shrinking frog”.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-162c59894e522049ebabd6e306dea26b-lq)

A note - paradoxical frogs aren’t entirely unique in this shrinking business. Off the top of my head, goliath beetles are another example (the larvae are up to 25 cm, the adults from 5–11). However, insects are always weird; I think that the fact that a fellow tetrapod does this makes it even more amazing.

## The Most Powerful Muscle on Earth
    
**Upvotes**: 298 | **Comments**: 2 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/Which-animal-has-the-fastest-tongue/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Surprisingly, this honour does not go to any kind of chameleon as you’d naturally think, but of all things, a type of salamander.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-39535a0d1b26c1efd12dfe944e2a1e5f-lq)

Bolitaglossa is a genus of salamander - specifically, lungless salamander. I’ll give you three guesses to guess why they’re called that. They’re gill-less, too, so they just breathe through their skin.

According to the paper [Extremely high-power tongue projection in plethodontid salamanders](https://jeb.biologists.org/content/210/4/655.full "jeb.biologists.org"), salamanders of the genus Bolitaglossa are capable of protracting their tongue from full extension in a ridiculous 3 milliseconds!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f739c84ea246ee53dd3dab2baab6409d)

When these amazing critters shoot out their tongues, they produce 18,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle, beating chameleons by several thousand watts. The tongue of a Bolitoglossa salamander is the fastest and most powerful muscle known to man.

## The Solar Salamander, and Friends
    
**Upvotes**: 217 | **Comments**: 21 | **Date**: [Updated 1y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-unusual-salamanders-in-the-world/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Salamanders! If you are under the impression that these amphibians are plain and boring, then you could be forgiven, but you’re also in dire need of this answer. There are over 600 species of salamander, and they range from human-sized lumbering brutes with vicious teeth to emaciated, cave-dwelling, eel-like weirdos.

Let’s run through some of the most bizarre and fascinating salamanders of the world…

Giant salamanders

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-075f158f84f519519d2008477cd6fc02-lq)

There are 4 species in this family: the smallest, the hellbender, lives in the eastern US. There’s another in Japan and two in China. The largest of all is the South China giant salamander, which can reach a staggering 1.8 metres in length and weigh 65 kg, making it the world’s largest amphibian.

Giant salamanders have terrifyingly sharp teeth, and males can even decapitate each other in territorial battles. If that wasn’t bad enough, Japanese giant salamanders secrete a gluey white slime which smells like, as one author put it, the “rankest smelling public urinal crossed with the stale smell of certain bodily secretions”. Another interesting fact about them is that males, rather than females, incubate the eggs.

Spotted salamander

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c5c6013268a0d77ed0a9af05d79c9364-lq)

While it mightn’t look strange outwardly, this species is incredibly unique. It’s the world’s only photosynthetic vertebrate! A few hours after a spotted salamander lays its eggs, green algae known as Oophila amblystomatis colonize said eggs, insinuate themselves into the unborn amphibians’ cells, and start photosynthesizing.

The algae turn the sunlight’s energy into glucose, which the gestating salamanders then absorb for nourishment. This means that the spotted salamander is not only the only photosynthetic vertebrate, but also the only vertebrate which has symbiotic organisms living in its cells (unless you count mitochondria). You could even call it… a solarmander.

Axolotl

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cd1be63a52fbf7a747368cf428ec1618-lq)

This critically endangered salamander is an obvious choice. It is, or rather was, a lake-dwelling creature, having no lungs, but red, frilly gills instead. They originally inhabited lakes in the Valley of Mexico, but the massive urbanization of Mexico City reduced these lakes to a handful of polluted canals - hence, they’re critically endangered in the wild.

Most axolotls are brown or olive, but they can be white (as seen above), grey or black too. They’re neotenic, meaning that they don’t metamorphose into adults but stay as “larvae” for their whole lives.

What’s more, they have the amazing ability to regenerate after wounds which would otherwise be critical - they can regrow eyes, and even parts of the brain. The genome of the axolotl is huge; with 32 billion base pairs, it’s ten times the size of the human genome.

Lungless salamanders

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8cfbf75125a604aa65efcb59818cedd9-lq)

The plethodontids, or lungless salamanders, are the most diverse salamander family, and among their 370 species are some which have evolved some really wacky behaviours. There’s one, the Mount Lyell Salamander, that lives on the slopes of California’s Sierra Nevada and escapes from predators by coiling its body, tucking in its limbs, and rolling downhill.

Then there’s the genus Bolitaglossa, which has the fastest and most powerful muscle of any animal in the world. Its tongue can shoot out at insect prey to full extension in a mind-blowing 3 milliseconds, producing 18,000 watts per kilogram in the process. There’s even a species which reportedly feeds on the fruiting bodies of fungi, which would make it the only fungivorous amphibian.

Sharp-ribbed newts

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9e4872ad14faa35edbde5eea3478e4f6-lq)

The sharp-ribbed newts (which are, of course, salamanders rather than newts) are found only in North Africa and Iberia. The most fascinating thing about them is definitely their incredibly unique defense mechanism. When threatened by predators, they thrust their sharp rib bones outward, which pierce through their skin.

Furthermore, the ribs are coated in poison, so this behaviour could be seen as a primitive, basic form of venom injection. Interestingly enough, one species - the Iberian ribbed newt - has been sent to outer space and studied six times. first in 1985 and most recently in 2005.

Sirens

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a926d255b4cd91f10da6e521fa7acc78-lq)

You could make a case for sirens being the world’s weirdest salamanders, for sure. They’re fully aquatic, and have taken on a serpentine, eel-like form, with tiny, underdeveloped forelimbs, doing away with the hind pair entirely. Like the aforementioned axolotl, they breathe using frilly, frond-like gills. Modern sirens never exceed 70 cm in length, but one prehistoric species was a formidable 1.6 metres.

Due to their diet of hard-shelled clams and molluscs, they’ve also lost their teeth, opting instead for a powerful crushing beak made of keratin. Another bizarre aspect of their eating habits is that they are the only plant-eating salamanders, feeding on algae and water plants. During the dry season, some species have the ability to secrete a cocoon of mucus around their body, protecting them in the mud until the waters returns.

Mole salamanders

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5232f42beab9be7c7a76ce6e09a9a314-pjlq)

Though they don’t look the part, mole salamanders are close relatives of the axolotl, and are amazing in that they are entirely female. Yes, you heard me right; in some American populations of mole salamanders, all offspring are born female and remain that way until death. Their method of reproduction is one of the most unique and fascinating in the animal kingdom.

To reproduce, these salamanders have to be impregnated by a male from a different local salamander species. However, the offspring will not be a hybrid; the male’s sperm is used to fertilize the egg, but after that, the female discards the sperm cell’s genome and switches to asexual development. That being said, in some cases the female actually “steals” some of the male’s genes; a process known as kleptogenesis.

Olm

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ed3995e0d805e7e7d514469ecdf2ff4f-lq)

Lastly, we’ll finish with another awesome species: the olm. It’s the only vertebrate in Europe which lives only in caves, and is often referred to as the “human fish”. Inhabiting the countless caverns found in southeastern Europe’s Dinaric Karst region, the olm is completely blind, has no pigment in its skin, and stays in its larval form for its life.

While it cannot see, the olm has incredible senses of smell, hearing, and can even sense weak electric fields; studies suggest that it actually uses the Earth’s magnetic field as a navigational aid. There’s also a unique subspecies of olm known as the black olm, pictured above, which is a brownish-grey colour and has better vision. This indicates that black olms colonized the underground world more recently.

* * *

So, we’ve had huge slimy brutes, photosynthetic vertebrates, neotenic oddballs with a regeneration superpower, ballistic-tongued predators, venomous-ribbed astronauts, beaked plant-eating serpents, all-female species, and blind cave demons. Like I said, if you thought salamanders were boring, you were seriously wrong.

## Why You're Afraid of Snakes
    
**Upvotes**: 177 | **Comments**: 11 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/Fear-of-snakes-is-one-of-the-most-common-phobias-yet-many-people-have-never-seen-a-snake-in-person-So-how-is-this-fear-generated/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Ophidiophobia is something which has a genetic basis, and is deeply rooted in human, primate, and even mammal evolution as a whole. A 2001 paper - [Emotion drives attention: detecting the snake in the grass](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11561921 "www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov") - found that images of snakes and spiders are identified much quicker by the human brain than those of random objects.

There is even a hypothesis, the Snake Detection Theory, that detecting serpents was a crucial factor in the evolution of us primates’ advanced trichromatic color vision; we have three color receptor cones whereas most mammals have two.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ef8601c678c20be525de80f3ce9d0f9b-lq)

In this 2017 study - [Snake scales, partial exposure, and the Snake Detection Theory: A human event-related potentials study](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46331 "www.nature.com") - vervet monkeys and macaques were shown the above images. When shown the ones of snake scales, brain activity spiked.

There was also one anthropological study on a Philippine tribe called the Agta, which aimed to shed light on how ancient humans and snakes might have interacted. It found that about a quarter of Agta men had been attacked by pythons, with a traumatic python-related incident happening once every 2–3 years.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ee450c242e6e000712bf7b6fe31d1b24-lq)

Perhaps the Agta are a special case, but I think it’s fair to say that snakes must have played a significant part in the lives of prehistoric hominins. With all this evidence in mind, it’s no wonder that he fear of snakes is the world’s most commonly reported phobia.

## Death by Gluttony in the Deep Sea

A strong contender, in my view, would be the black swallower.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f0196272d24c3b4c4572d9bcf72a548f-lq)

Relative to its overall size, this grotesque fish has the largest stomach of any animal. It lives as many as 2.7 kilometres below the ocean surface, and at those kinds of barren depths food is very hard to come by.

Because of this, if you happen to catch a meal, then you’d better not waste any of it. To solve this problem, the black swallower evolved a bizarre, elastic stomach which can swell to many times its original size. You can’t get full if your belly is unfillable, after all.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cc4a984fa971f500779321739428c708-lq)

The feeding feats which this fish can achieve are mind-blowing. It’s able to swallow fish ten times its size whole! Of course, having a big stomach is no use if you can’t get your prey in there in the first place. We still don’t know how exactly the swallower swallows, but the prevailing theory is that it “walks” its jaws over the fish, tail-first.

That’s not to say that it doesn’t sometimes bite off more than it can chew. This black swallower below was fished up off the Cayman Islands in 2007. It tried to gobble up an 86 centimetre long snake mackerel; a meal nearly five times its own length! The huge mackerel ruptured the swallower’s stomach, killing it.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9fda58790e8b78bcbe147d58de2a2c0c-lq)

In other instances, the oversized meal will start decomposing before the swallower has finished digesting it. This releases gases, effectively turning the stomach into a balloon which buoys the fish up to the surface. Due to the pressure change, this too results in excruciating death.

This process is actually how most black swallower specimens come to be found by humans. As they live so deep beneath the waves, much about their lifestyle is shrouded in mystery.

The moral of the story: if you overeat, the lunch rotting in your stomach will produce buoyant gases and you’ll float up to the stratosphere and die.

## A Toxic Lake at the Bottom of the Ocean
    
**Upvotes**: 3,063 | **Comments**: 27 | **Date**: [Updated 1y](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-lakes-under-the-sea/answer/Gary-Meaney)

If you pour oil into a glass of water, the oil will, of course, float to the top - because it’s less dense. It’s almost like there’s a lake of water in the oil. So, if you had a fluid much denser than sea water, a similar principle could allow for a “lake” to form under the sea.

As it happens, such situations certainly do occur in the natural world. When deep-sea deposits of salt dissolve into the water, the result is an extremely saline “brine” which is significantly denser than normal seawater. It gathers in pools at the ocean’s floor, like this:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7ac0675fab062e862aac36dde679f941-lq)

Here’s a good diagram to help explain:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d6de392ea5cb94da30c5a05b315bd96f-lq)

I should note, these can also occur off the Antarctic coast due to salt becoming more concentrated in the remaining water during the formation of ice.

The dense brine acts in an eerily similar way underwater to water in air. There’s a clear surface and shoreline, and it ripples and forms waves on contact. Additionally, much of the time it’s very rich in methane, which has an interesting effect on the ecosystem.

Many bacteria are methanotrophs - in simple terms, they “eat” methane. Furthermore, some of these have formed a close relationship with certain species of mussels, by setting up shop inside the molluscs’ gills. They feed on methane and the mussels feed on the waste products they produce.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-38668a085ca2395292538b749267730a-lq)

Because of this, you will often see a “beach” of mussels surrounding the lake of brine, filtering the methane from the water for their bacterial symbiotes. To make matters more interesting, there is a species of bacteria-eating snail which has the mysterious ability to detect the water the mussels alter, and seeks them out.

However, brine pools aren’t always beneficial for organisms. Their water is so incredibly saline - up to ten times that above the surface - and can also contain toxic chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide. Because of this, many marine creatures that chance a dive into one of the pools don’t come back out.

## The Fish With No Mouth
    
**Upvotes**: 2,738 | **Comments**: 47 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-amazing-looking-fish/answer/Gary-Meaney)

There are innumerable candidates for this question, but here are some which I can think of off the top of my head.

*   Lancetfish: Little is known about the biology of this family of fish, which contains only two species. They can be very big, over 2 metres long in some cases, and are probably ambush predators which eat other fish, cephalopods and crustaceans. They’re found the world over, except for polar waters.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ee7970341009da999f6693b2715f241a-lq)

*   Jellynoses: Also known as tadpole fish, they get their name from the gelatinous tissue which fills their body. Deep sea creatures which feed on invertebrates living on the seafloor, they’ve lost most of their bone, instead having skeletons of mainly cartilage. They’re pretty big too, at up to 2 metres in length.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1d731111d29ff78f8334e58781130049-lq)

*   Kaluga: This sturgeon is quite possibly the world’s largest freshwater fish, at up to 5.6 meters long and weighing as much as a small car! They live only in the rivers of the Amur Basin in eastern Russia and China, and are the apex predators of their environment. As they’re not fussy eaters, I wonder if they eat the Amur softshell turtles which they co-exist with.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c8acb3138b90d1be1a8fd8cfb44a9198-lq)

*   Flying gurnard: This fish, native to coastal waters in the Atlantic, is immediately noticeable, as it has very long pelvic fins. When alarmed, these fins fan out into huge, semicircular “wings”, which are translucent and often have blue patterns on them. It might seem exotic, but if you live on the Atlantic it’s probably not far off shore.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3bc0ef42447f66c4cde004eca94a0ae4-lq)

*   Sea robins: This family is most amazing to me because of their six, arthropod-like legs, which evolved from fin-rays. They use these to crawl around and also to smell. If that wasn’t weird enough, some species are armour-plated, they make drumming sounds with a muscle in their body and can glide using beautifully coloured fins.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2dcd85d1f7ef2ab907adb07ef78b369b-lq)

*   Chinaman-leatherjacket: Don’t be fooled by this fish’ unassuming appearance - it’s one of the scariest ray-finned fish I know of. They have extremely sharp teeth and have been known to rip octopuses apart in swarms. They also kill fish as big as marlins, can crush fish hooks in their jaws and occasionally bite unfortunate divers.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d3bd51a4a11ba88cba46f29115a52c6a-lq)

*   Flabby whalefish: Among the deepest-living fish, these bright red monsters are damn weird. Many species are blind, instead relying on detecting vibrations to navigate. Strangest of all, the males only eat when they’re babies - after becoming adults, their mouths fuse shut and they slowly metabolize shells eaten as juveniles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8be4e5621f5be9c80c52e5d79d10cf8b-pjlq)

Thanks for reading, and hopefully you enjoyed learning about these bizarre types of fish which I think could use a little more attention.

## How Sharks Rinse Their Stomachs
    
**Upvotes**: 2,203 | **Comments**: 43 | **Date**: [9mo](https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-little-known-fact-about-an-otherwise-well-known-animal/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Sharks. Everyone knows sharks - many love them, many fear them. However, they have a particular grotesque habit which few are aware of: gastric eversion.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5492b95ef279adbc3b8068d91139962a-lq)

Have a look at the photo above. Did you notice something in the shark’s mouth? It’s not prey, nor is it a tongue - it’s the shark’s stomach.

There might have been something harmful in there, such as an indigestible item, a parasite or a buildup of mucus. Or, more likely in this particular case, the person behind the camera triggered its fight-or-flight instincts and it’s “ejecting” the extra weight to make a quick getaway.

It’s thought that all sharks possess this ability; their stomach turns inside out, gets pushed out of the mouth, and is quickly retracted. Here’s a beached specimen with its stomach everted:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-512c651619830614225245ff96d12bdf-pjlq)

Plus one studied in a laboratory. Both are shortfin makos.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-72e92bed1d517ad31c7b4bc87a959ec2-pjlq)

As it happens, this ability isn’t limited to sharks. Their close relatives the rays also do it, in what is more commonly known as stomach rinsing.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-15720b6ad34d67498d879a4a440be967)

Some rays, such as manta rays, can also perform intestinal eversion, which is done, well… out the other end.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-11280df27b25b8c73810d1f1f22d2333-pjlq)

Gastric eversion has also evolved independently in echinoderms such as sea stars, sea cucumbers and sea urchins, and in frogs. To make matters more nauseating, frogs will often use their hands to stroke the heaved-up organ, making sure the nasty stuff gets cleaned away.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-697aa58e6fb9ae2bb61c8a9f26ca564e-lq)

So, I’m sure none of you had any intention of seeing this on your dash today, but our beloved algorithm has brought it to you anyway. I’d say have a nice a day, like I usually do, but I think after this read that’s a bit of a big ask.

In any case, take this from this piece: vomiting might not be pleasant, but at least humans don’t retch up their distended stomachs instead.

## Aliens in the Abyss
    
**Upvotes**: 2,109 | **Comments**: 86 | **Date**: [Aug-27](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scariest-fish-in-the-world/answer/Gary-Meaney)

The stomiiforms are what immediately jump to mind, for me at least. This is not a single species of fish, but rather a whole order of species, comprising over 400 known types. As you would expect, they all dwell in the deep sea, which means there are probably plenty more stomiiforms to be discovered.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-51a009613aa191b54a8389b847a7cb7c-lq)

Here are some facts about these creepy critters which will surely convince you that they’re in the running for the title of world’s scariest fish. They’re also really, really interesting!

*   Virtually all species are bioluminescent; that is, they produce light. They do this using rows of organs called photophores, in which the light-emitting molecule coelenterazine reacts with enzymes. These photophores can be beautifully intricate, with lenses, colour filters, specialized muscles and more involved.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-159c2bfe102c1b727d2fb1f32b7d7653-lq)

*   Many stomiiforms, especially dragonfishes (who we’ll see a lot more of shortly) have transparent teeth, which are invisible to potential prey even in the light of bioluminescence. These teeth are also incredibly strong, embedded with tough microscopic crystals throughout.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7b6f5dbfd33e69ad04fdbab822a0c353-lq)

*   The biggest stomiiform, the so-called obese dragonfish, is over half a metre long. This may not sound like much, but it’s very large for an animal which lives 5 kilometres below sea level, and it is an apex predator in its environment. It gets its mean name from its rather bloated appearance.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-776207237d33eafd9a2957b077857997-pjlq)

*   The larvae of the black dragonfish are very unique, as they have these huge eye stalks, which are themselves half as long as the body. This setup allows the young dragonfish to rotate their eyeballs in practically any direction, so they can watch for predators at all times in their vulnerable developmental phase.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c867721001340b59bfe8eb02bb62a3b2-pjlq)

*   My favourite stomiiform is undoubtedly the freakish stoplight loosejaw. They have no skin below their mouth, hence “loosejaw”, allowing the jaws to lunge out explosively at prey with great speed. Because of this, the incredibly complex structure of the fish jaw is on full display, and they look like veritable alien life forms.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dec7166cdee0fe144437524a7b598fac-lq)

*   The “stoplight” part of the aforementioned fish’ name comes from the red light they produce. This is extremely significant; loosejaws and their relatives are the only fish on Earth which can see and produce red light. The stoplight is therefore really an invisible spotlight, which illuminates the environment, but is imperceptible to prey!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4ac0f5ba65cac89a766aae61188929a8-lq)

*   The bristlemouths are the world’s most numerous vertebrate, by far. These tiny deep-sea stomiiforms exist in unfathomable abundance down in the abyss, and are thought to number in the trillions, or even quadrillions. Also, they are always born male, and later transform into females - this is known as sequential hermaphroditism.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b0ca1f42de9045b16b4f457a3e77f701-pjlq)

*   The hatchetfishes are another strange and unique group in this order. Their bulging eyes are permanently angled upward, as they use the faint light from the surface to detect the silhouettes of potential victims overhead. To camouflage and avoid falling prey to the same strategy, they utilize counter-illumination - luminous underbellies.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5bf44d24108f1378ac7cd5953ac604e9-pjlq)

*   In addition to having black skin from head to toe (or head to caudal fin, I suppose), some dragonfish have a black stomach lining inside them. This blocks out the bioluminescence of the fish they swallow, which might give away their position to predators and would-be prey alike.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4edfde0f8a673df32ea16cf6e5c1bb27-lq)

*   Speaking of such colouration, the aptly named Pacific blackdragon is one of the blackest organisms in the world - its scales, which are densely packed with melanosomes, absorb 99.5% percent of light which hits them. Perhaps I shouldn’t be telling you this… maybe [Anish Kapoor](https://www.thecollector.com/vantablack-anish-kapoor-stuart-semple-controversy/ "www.thecollector.com") is the only person allowed to write about this fish.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7a2d56ebd2340745257dd4541c1677d5-lq)

*   One species of stomiiform, Bathophilus indicus, has fangs on its tongue. These help it snag slippery fish, and they angle backwards, so their grip is near impossible to escape. It should come as no surprise to you that, being an overdramatically horrific creature, B. indicus lives in Australia.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0e1d5c9984041b240df8e7ce44b02230-pjlq)

So, those are twelve facts about the stomiiforms which should highlight just how bizarre and spooky they really are. Even still, when it comes to deep sea life, they’re about as “normal” as it gets! Thanks for reading, have a great day everybody.

## Fantastic Flatfish and Their Travelling Eyeballs
    
**Upvotes**: 1,672 | **Comments**: 51 | **Date**: [Updated 1y](https://www.quora.com/What-animal-is-so-much-weirder-than-people-realize/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Flatfish! Chances are you’ve eaten one before. We tend to ignore them, take them for granted. They are so commonplace in our lives that it’s hard to see how bizarre they really are.

First of all, you have their defining characteristic - the fact that both of their eyes are on the same side of their head. The fact that they managed to gradually evolve this setup over millions of years is mind-blowing in itself.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e4eacd734e5b75ac990e2b8534f0e299-lq)

To see how this fish “should” look, you have to turn your head sideways. From an anatomical perspective, that’s not the fish’s back you’re seeing, it’s its flank. Before anybody comments that this “could not have evolved”, I’ll add that this transition is well-understood and supported by both fossil and ontogenetic evidence.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-475a6d9d7fe88bc0a0c5d2315eba73ef-lq)

Back to square one, lads.

Now, what’s interesting is that all flatfish are born symmetrical, like other fish. That’s not to say the larvae are boring - in fact, they too are often ridiculously bizarre:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-24cdd17837a2ad689ea3bd7991e50606-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d3d01e4d891a87f497f428bff2f6a309-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9704a2ed1c7eab13bf632d5f46616c02-lq)

To make matters more confusing, there is one species which breaks the status quo and has one eye on the top of its head. This is the rather gruesome-looking Greenland halibut, which has reversed its evolutionary history somewhat to attain better peripheral vision:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-77e9332fad18f68a9481550cff462ce3-pjlq)

This also gives it the appearance of having one eye when it’s lying on its side.

For the more conforming species, however, both eyes will either be on the left or the right side. Well… if you’ve been paying attention, it might not surprise you very much that it’s even more complicated than this, because in one family - the spiny turbots:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-712fab16100d438ddf85309c98bad302-pjlq)

Individuals of the same species may be “left-eyed” or “right-eyed”! Furthermore, in a given species of spiny turbot, the ratio between the two types is usually around 1:1. In the natural world, there is always an exception - or, more often, four or five different exceptions - to the rule.

And, believe me, it gets weirder. For example, did you know that many flatfishes can change colour to camouflage, like chameleons?

The below photos are all of the same fish, taken in a very short space of time:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d52f90451072fb9389d1428384e68265-lq)

This one can even camouflage against a goddamn checkerboard:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c6be95d323c0377aa9db08e75bd03dc1-pjlq)

They do this in the same way which cephalopods change colour, with specially adapted chromatophores - these cells-turned-organs are essentially little balloons containing many granules of pigmentation, which can be inflated or deflated at will.

This poor guy damaged his eyesight, and thus cannot adapt his coloration to the environment effectively:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-44904bee5d8516279e6eac99b966dbdf-pjlq)

In addition to all this, some species here and there have more weird features and adaptations. Some have their eyes mounted on rotating “turrets”, so that they can swivel around independently of one another.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-beb0e75d442f3f48b51e9094f9879293-lq)

Others have eyes which are spaced really widely apart:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-89d1188136708f7b46ca2608e6bc6a08-lq)

And then there’s one - the leopard flounder - which has these strange stalks trailing from the back of its eye stumps, which are used for territorial and courtship display.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7e00672ca9db944dd0dec75631addf54-lq)

And then there’s another one - Asterorhombus intermedius - which has a little wiggly lure sticking out of its mouth to attract smaller fish into its maw.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-28cb39e3a4dea119c14a29933c10e6b8-lq)

If you look closely, you can see that the lure is in fact part of its dorsal fin (bottom left), and would once have been one of the fin rays.

Surely that’s it. Surely these guys couldn’t get any weirder…

Wrong again! We’ve got huge-mouthed flatfish!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-aa6d098433c5cf98b6b729bfddadde00-lq)

Flatfishes with fans of neon-blue spines!

## The Eel that Entered the Heart of a Shark
    
**Upvotes**: 1,634 | **Comments**: 39 | **Date**: [Updated 1y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-interesting-parasites/answer/Gary-Meaney)

I think that the most interesting and bizarre parasite of all would be rhizocephalan barnacles, but as I’ve written on them [before](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-oddest-lifeform-ever-discovered/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"), I’ll go with a close second - the snubnosed eel.

Warning: graphic imagery ahead

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-434aee4304d0ab6fc2336e17278ee320-lq)

The snubnosed, or pug-nosed, eel - scientifically termed Simenchelys parasitica \- is perhaps the most gruesome and grisly parasite I can think of. As juveniles, they are ecologically similar to hagfish - deep sea scavengers, although they sometimes feed on microscopic crustaceans.

However, as they grow up, they get a lot more nasty. They become parasites of larger fish - halibut, for example. The eels latch onto their host and then start slowly burrowing in, sometimes going all the way to the spine, or even finding themselves in the fish’ abdominal cavity.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f9fc58c9fc61142e7196677dcc6d86ab-lq)

Imagine how agonizing that must be for the host fish - to have another animal gradually worm its way into your body. But it gets worse.

In 1992, fishermen at Montauk, New York State, landed a huge shortfin mako shark - 395 kilograms in weight, in fact. They cut it open and discovered two snubnosed eels, each close to a foot long, nestled inside the shark’s heart, feeding on its blood.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-577dafc688989e5e5f4468208ebf204a-pjlq)

How they got into the heart is unclear, but scientists hypothesize that perhaps they entered the gills or even the throat of the mako, and from that point somehow got into the circulatory system. In any case, the eels had been there long enough for much of the damaged heart tissue to regenerate.

To have an eel burrow into your heart must be one of the most excruciating things in the whole natural world. I, for one, am glad I’m not a fish.

For such a diverse and influential group of animals, sharks have made precious little appearances in my previous answers. This question will be a good opportunity to remedy that negligence.

They’ve been around for a staggering 420 million years, predating the first dinosaurs, the first land-dwelling vertebrates, and even the first trees. There are more than half a thousand species, spread across every corner of the world’s oceans. In this answer, for brevity, I’m just going to be talking about modern sharks, as delving into the vast array of prehistoric sharks would double the length at least.

So, without further ado, here are my best shark facts. Enjoy!

*   Some tropical shark species, such as hammerheads, are highly social during the day. In summer, they migrate in massive schools, searching for cooler waters. When night falls, they all take to the reefs and split up to hunt for fish. These schools are often more than a hundred strong, though groups of several thousand have even been reported!

*   Sand tiger sharks have a very macabre tendency known as intrauterine cannibalism. A pregnant sand tiger has two wombs, each containing many eggs, but only one newborn emerges from each. That’s because the first fetus to develop functioning teeth kills and eats its embryonic siblings! This brutal behaviour ensures that the baby shark enters the world with a boost of growth from its prenatal snack.

*   Continuing with the theme of grotesque habits, sharks have an unusual ability that they use to eject unwanted stomach contents - gastric eversion. The stomach can be turned inside-out and pushed out of the mouth, before quickly being retracted. This tactic can be used to shed excess weight for a quick getaway, or to get rid of a parasite or indigestible object.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-512c651619830614225245ff96d12bdf-pjlq)

*   Only one genus of shark lives exclusively in freshwater, the river sharks, pictured. There are three species, which inhabit South and Southeast Asia, as well as Australasia. Unfortunately, they are extremely rare, so scientists don’t know very much about them. Some marine species, such as the smooth dogfish, sandbar shark and bull shark have been known to enter freshwater, too - the third was once found 1,100 kilometres up the Mississippi River!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-701acd2acb827aeb177d4ef3c710647f-lq)

*   The reason that there are so few freshwater sharks is to do with osmoregulation. In order to be in osmotic balance with the the surrounding seawater, most sharks’ blood is very salty, rich in chemicals like urea and trimethylamine oxide. Because of this, they cannot survive in the much less salty environment of fresh water. It also means that dead sharks usually have a very strong smell of ammonia.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d58e3284d9b8a1f72b3cc1477877f29d-pjlq)

*   No sharks contains more urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) than the deep sea’s sleeper sharks, in the family Somniosidae. Eating the flesh of a sleeper shark can lead to symptoms of extreme drunkenness that last for days. This is because trimethylamine is a powerful toxin and nerve agent. To avoid these ailments, Icelandic people let sleeper meat ferment for months, producing a dish called hákarl - quite the acquired taste, apparently.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-41e8ca36835cc2f3bcb4697005d3ccf5-lq)

*   The most famous sleeper shark is undoubtedly the Greenland shark, a sluggish, lumbering resident of the Arctic Ocean. In terms of scale, it’s an absolute sea monster, with the largest specimens weighing in excess of a tonne. However, the Greenland shark’s most impressive is its longevity - one individual’s age was estimated to be at the very least 272, and possibly as old as 512! This makes it the oldest-living vertebrate.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3c82b625d96d85c43a33a635812088ed-lq)

*   Sharks differ from the bony fish in that they don’t have swim bladders: gas-filled organs which are used to control buoyancy. Instead, they use their livers, which are filled with an oily substance called squalene. By altering the composition of this oil, they can increase or decrease their buoyancy. A shark’s liver can constitute nearly a third of its body mass. Some sharks, like the pictured zebra shark, have negative buoyancy, as they spend their days on the seafloor.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-41bf4eff64f6b78713c570c60867e766-pjlq)

*   Of these bottom-dwelling sharks, the most outlandish is perhaps the tasselled wobbegong. With beige colouration and a jagged fringe of fleshy lobes surrounding its head, it blends in perfectly with the seafloor - can you even spot it in the photo below? To acquire and kill unsuspecting prey, it has a wiggly fish-shaped tail which it uses as a lure, and an enormous mouth capable of swallowing whole sharks nearly as big as the wobbegong itself!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fd7e255ce173670af10e985978b570a2-lq)

*   Also in Australia, there exists another interesting species of carpet shark - one which can crawl on land. The epaulette shark lives in shallow tide pools, which are small and cramped but crowded with respiring organisms. As a result, the shark must tolerate an extreme scarcity of oxygen - it can comfortably live for hours without any oxygen at all, in fact. Thus, if its tide pool dries up, the epaulette shark can simply walk to a new pool.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fcff5bd3365686de2f37b93ef845be8e-pjlq)

*   The thresher sharks, a family of three species found all over the world, have a very interesting hunting strategy. They get their name from their enormous, scythe-like tails, which can be several metres in length. When hunting, a thresher shark will use its tail to slap and stun fish, or even slice them in half! They are pretty big, too, with the largest species weighing up to 500 kilograms.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ccd5f078b2ce347d8f1d5d758b3e678f-lq)

*   Threshers, along with another shark family (the mackerel sharks), are among the world’s only endothermic, or warm-blooded, fish. They have heat-generating strips of muscle in the centre of their body, and an intricate, tangled system of blood vessels called a rete mirabile (“miraculous net”) to retain the heat produced. Mackerel sharks, or lamnids, are very energetic thanks to this trait - they’re the fastest sharks in the world.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-80c431f6f430f942d79dbfda68a34a0c-pjlq)

*   Another weird physiological feature that some sharks have is biofluorescence. If you shine blue light on a swell shark or a chain catshark, it will emit an eery green glow. Down in the deep sea, the only light that can penetrate the abyss from above is blue. By absorbing that blue light and reflecting it back as green, the sharks stand out sharply to each other in the depths. The fluorescent substances also seem to play a role in protection from bacteria.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-01c2467d5b59cc51c011ab9f37bc8341-lq)

*   Speaking of the swell shark, this species has a very unusual defensive behaviour which gives it its name. If threatened by a predator, it contorts itself until it can grab its tail with its mouth, before sucking up water, causing its body to inflate. In this engorged state, it’s very hard for a would-be attacker to get its jaws around the swell shark. The leucistic individual pictured below went viral as a supposed “alien" on Instagram in 2016.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-871ef4cccaa366c9d342ef46260f53c6-lq)

*   No shark, however, has been misidentified as a supernatural creature more times than the basking shark. On several occasion, mangled carcasses (“globsters") of this filter-feeding giant have led to wild speculation about sea monsters and living plesiosaurs. The most famous case was a decomposing basking shark, missing fins and much of its head, caught by the Japanese trawler Zuiyō Maru in 1977.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-635de4030f637e4ee2fb1dcf7760e973-lq)

*   While we're talking about prehistoric monsters, allow me to introduce you to the frilled sharks. This 84 million year old family contains two living species, which have hardly changed since the Cretaceous. With a serpentine form and a reptilian head, they certainly look the part. They lack the powerful jawbones of more advanced sharks, instead using the power of suction and a rather bizarre set of jagged teeth to tackle their prey (primarily squid).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0409f2ffd9ca7728c8385b98f4ec7ec1-lq)

*   The frilled shark isn’t the only living fossil under the sea - for example, the rare goblin shark’s lineage is even more ancient. It’s the last surviving species in the family Mitskurinidae, which is a staggering 125 million years old. Goblin sharks are characterized by a big blade-like snout which projects from their skull, and pink colouration they get from blood vessels beneath the skin. It’s likely that they are ambush predators, catching passing fish by shooting their protrusible jaws forward.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9f0e85c3dc4efea6c7e7d7dece58e966-lq)

*   The viper dogfish is another shark with a marvellously mobile mouth. Rather than snapping and biting its prey like other dogfish, this deepwater-dwelling species engulfs its poor victims whole. This is enabled by a special bone in the skull called the hyomandibula, which swings forward, rapidly extending the jaws far out in front to seize prey. Viper dogfish look about as horrific as you’d expect such gruesome sea monsters to look…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6e0df3e2c7a2d6d5b61a8396c6741c2a-lq)

*   Now, we move from the viper dogfish to the Portuguese dogfish. You’d think that the two were closely related, but the latter’s name is a misnomer; it actually belongs to the aforementioned sleeper shark family. The Portuguese dogfish has the distinction of being the deepest-living of all the sharks, with one specimen recorded at a positively crushing depth of 3,675 metres. Down there, it has to withstand 36 million pascals of water pressure.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e85f4a20b85cebdf901714fa36b8f65e-lq)

*   In 2001 at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, keepers were shocked to find their female bonnethead shark swimming around with a newborn pup, despite there being no males in the aquarium. Who fathered the baby? In truth, there was no father - this was the first documented case of parthenogenesis, or virgin birth, in sharks. The new shark was a perfect genetic clone of the mother, produced by the fusion of an egg cell and one of its inert “sister” gametes.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-48d50b09a1ae8bb602d7cd77a4896008-lq)

*   That’s not the only noteworthy thing about this species - it’s omnivorous, too. Yes, the bonnethead is the only shark known to eat plant matter; seagrass constitutes the majority of its diet. This must require some specialized adaptations in the digestive system, as the cellulose-rich grass would be impossible for other sharks to break down. It’s thought that bonnethead eats so much veggies in order to cushion its gut from the sharp spines of blue crabs, another dietary staple.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7ec7761933a91e8df563c198ccb9f2a2-lq)

*   Time to transition from one of the least specialized sharks to one of the most specialized, at least in terms of diet. The cookiecutter shark is the species I speak of. Using the round, fleshy sucker it has for a mouth, this shark famously latches onto larger animals and leaves a crater-shaped bite mark. Practically anything big enough is fair game, even humans. In the ’70s and ‘80s, several US Navy submarines were incapacitated by suspected “enemy weaponry” which turned out to be cookiecutter sharks!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b9188f3a6cbc12a68cf95aa4648d5103-lq)

*   You might have heard of sawfish, which, despite appearances, are a type of ray. There also exist sawsharks - sharks which have a long, flat snout, or rostrum, lined with sharp spines and a conspicuous pair of tendrils called barbels. The function of these barbels is not well understood - nor is much about sawsharks. It’s likely that they use their rostra more like swords than saws, slashing them from side to side to slice or bludgeon their prey.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-17a5acf3fb668bca2bd00b2620d5d87d-lq)

*   To counteract the several deep sea horrors you’ve seen in this answer, here’s an adorable deep sea delight: the pocket shark. It does not get its name from its diminutive size, but rather a strange pair of pockets it has next to its fins. No one really knows exactly what these pockets do, but the prevailing hypothesis is that they secrete some kind of luminous fluid. The species is still poorly studied, as it’s known only from one location, deep in the South Pacific.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-313f52f172a16e219046c224c47d2703-lq)

*   The biggest shark is of course the whale shark, which measures up to 18 metres in length. Like all sharks, its skin is covered in microscopic structures called dermal denticles, which are in fact modified teeth! It is, however, unique in the fact that even its eyeballs have their own layer of denticles, with several thousand on each. They most likely serve as armour, protecting the eyes, which lack lids and protrude out from the side of the head.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2545616823fdb3301dfef4aeec99bb2c-pjlq)

*   The angular roughshark is another species that has some unusual denticles. They are much larger than in other sharks, with each nodule being clearly visible. The largest denticles form a pair of rather strange-looking knobs above and below the eyes, which give the roughshark an amusingly weary appearance. Its tall hunchback and pig-like snout likewise contribute to this bizarre but humorous look.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-03426cf3f963a0887c368b357fe56f3b-lq)

*   An even more freaky-looking shark was found in Mexico back in 2011. It was a pale unborn fetus with one particular standout feature: it only had one eye. It wasn’t just missing an eye on the opposite side - no, its singular eyeball was in the center of its head, like that of a mythical Cyclops. Indeed, this genetic anomaly is known as cyclopia, and has been observed in human babies before.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-288d2f248aa99b85d6b002afdc577687-lq)

*   That’s not the only insane deformity sharks can have. Just last year, another oddball turned up off Sardinia - a blackmouth catshark which had neither skin nor teeth. Unlike the Cyclops shark, which was stillborn, this one was somehow alive and healthy! As the experts among you will know, skin and teeth tend to come in rather handy when you’re a shark, so it’s a mystery how this catshark managed to survive so long.

In the ’70s and ‘80s, several US Navy submarines were incapacitated by suspected “enemy weaponry” which turned out to be cookiecutter sharks!

*   You might have heard of sawfish, which, despite appearances, are a type of ray. There also exist sawsharks - sharks which have a long, flat snout, or rostrum, lined with sharp spines and a conspicuous pair of tendrils called barbels. The function of these barbels is not well understood - nor is much about sawsharks. It’s likely that they use their rostra more like swords than saws, slashing them from side to side to slice or bludgeon their prey.

*   To counteract the several deep sea horrors you’ve seen in this answer, here’s an adorable deep sea delight: the pocket shark. It does not get its name from its diminutive size, but rather a strange pair of pockets it has next to its fins. No one really knows exactly what these pockets do, but the prevailing hypothesis is that they secrete some kind of luminous fluid. The species is still poorly studied, as it’s known only from one location, deep in the South Pacific.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-313f52f172a16e219046c224c47d2703-lq)

*   The biggest shark is of course the whale shark, which measures up to 18 metres in length. Like all sharks, its skin is covered in microscopic structures called dermal denticles, which are in fact modified teeth! It is, however, unique in the fact that even its eyeballs have their own layer of denticles, with several thousand on each. They most likely serve as armour, protecting the eyes, which lack lids and protrude out from the side of the head.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2545616823fdb3301dfef4aeec99bb2c-pjlq)

*   The angular roughshark is another species that has some unusual denticles. They are much larger than in other sharks, with each nodule being clearly visible. The largest denticles form a pair of rather strange-looking knobs above and below the eyes, which give the roughshark an amusingly weary appearance. Its tall hunchback and pig-like snout likewise contribute to this bizarre but humorous look.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-03426cf3f963a0887c368b357fe56f3b-lq)

*   An even more freaky-looking shark was found in Mexico back in 2011. It was a pale unborn fetus with one particular standout feature: it only had one eye. It wasn’t just missing an eye on the opposite side - no, its singular eyeball was in the center of its head, like that of a mythical Cyclops. Indeed, this genetic anomaly is known as cyclopia, and has been observed in human babies before.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-288d2f248aa99b85d6b002afdc577687-lq)

*   That’s not the only insane deformity sharks can have. Just last year, another oddball turned up off Sardinia - a blackmouth catshark which had neither skin nor teeth. Unlike the Cyclops shark, which was stillborn, this one was somehow alive and healthy! As the experts among you will know, skin and teeth tend to come in rather handy when you’re a shark, so it’s a mystery how this catshark managed to survive so long.

For such a diverse and influential group of animals, sharks have made precious little appearances in my previous answers. This question will be a good opportunity to remedy that negligence.

They’ve been around for a staggering 420 million years, predating the first dinosaurs, the first land-dwelling vertebrates, and even the first trees. There are more than half a thousand species, spread across every corner of the world’s oceans. In this answer, for brevity, I’m just going to be talking about modern sharks, as delving into the vast array of prehistoric sharks would double the length at least.

So, without further ado, here are my best shark facts. Enjoy!

*   Some tropical shark species, such as hammerheads, are highly social during the day. In summer, they migrate in massive schools, searching for cooler waters. When night falls, they all take to the reefs and split up to hunt for fish. These schools are often more than a hundred strong, though groups of several thousand have even been reported!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4038c613f572e8607ba049c3bbba1cf1)

*   Sand tiger sharks have a very macabre tendency known as intrauterine cannibalism. A pregnant sand tiger has two wombs, each containing many eggs, but only one newborn emerges from each. That’s because the first fetus to develop functioning teeth kills and eats its embryonic siblings! This brutal behaviour ensures that the baby shark enters the world with a boost of growth from its prenatal snack.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ac6420960e93d05393e90e4638bb49a2-lq)

*   Continuing with the theme of grotesque habits, sharks have an unusual ability that they use to eject unwanted stomach contents - gastric eversion. The stomach can be turned inside-out and pushed out of the mouth, before quickly being retracted. This tactic can be used to shed excess weight for a quick getaway, or to get rid of a parasite or indigestible object.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-512c651619830614225245ff96d12bdf-pjlq)

*   Only one genus of shark lives exclusively in freshwater, the river sharks, pictured. There are three species, which inhabit South and Southeast Asia, as well as Australasia. Unfortunately, they are extremely rare, so scientists don’t know very much about them. Some marine species, such as the smooth dogfish, sandbar shark and bull shark have been known to enter freshwater, too - the third was once found 1,100 kilometres up the Mississippi River!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-701acd2acb827aeb177d4ef3c710647f-lq)

*   The reason that there are so few freshwater sharks is to do with osmoregulation. In order to be in osmotic balance with the the surrounding seawater, most sharks’ blood is very salty, rich in chemicals like urea and trimethylamine oxide. Because of this, they cannot survive in the much less salty environment of fresh water. It also means that dead sharks usually have a very strong smell of ammonia.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d58e3284d9b8a1f72b3cc1477877f29d-pjlq)

*   No sharks contains more urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) than the deep sea’s sleeper sharks, in the family Somniosidae. Eating the flesh of a sleeper shark can lead to symptoms of extreme drunkenness that last for days. This is because trimethylamine is a powerful toxin and nerve agent. To avoid these ailments, Icelandic people let sleeper meat ferment for months, producing a dish called hákarl - quite the acquired taste, apparently.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-41e8ca36835cc2f3bcb4697005d3ccf5-lq)

*   The most famous sleeper shark is undoubtedly the Greenland shark, a sluggish, lumbering resident of the Arctic Ocean. In terms of scale, it’s an absolute sea monster, with the largest specimens weighing in excess of a tonne. However, the Greenland shark’s most impressive is its longevity - one individual’s age was estimated to be at the very least 272, and possibly as old as 512! This makes it the oldest-living vertebrate.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3c82b625d96d85c43a33a635812088ed-lq)

*   Sharks differ from the bony fish in that they don’t have swim bladders: gas-filled organs which are used to control buoyancy. Instead, they use their livers, which are filled with an oily substance called squalene. By altering the composition of this oil, they can increase or decrease their buoyancy. A shark’s liver can constitute nearly a third of its body mass. Some sharks, like the pictured zebra shark, have negative buoyancy, as they spend their days on the seafloor.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-41bf4eff64f6b78713c570c60867e766-pjlq)

*   Of these bottom-dwelling sharks, the most outlandish is perhaps the tasselled wobbegong. With beige colouration and a jagged fringe of fleshy lobes surrounding its head, it blends in perfectly with the seafloor - can you even spot it in the photo below? To acquire and kill unsuspecting prey, it has a wiggly fish-shaped tail which it uses as a lure, and an enormous mouth capable of swallowing whole sharks nearly as big as the wobbegong itself!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fd7e255ce173670af10e985978b570a2-lq)

*   Also in Australia, there exists another interesting species of carpet shark - one which can crawl on land. The epaulette shark lives in shallow tide pools, which are small and cramped but crowded with respiring organisms. As a result, the shark must tolerate an extreme scarcity of oxygen - it can comfortably live for hours without any oxygen at all, in fact. Thus, if its tide pool dries up, the epaulette shark can simply walk to a new pool.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fcff5bd3365686de2f37b93ef845be8e-pjlq)

*   The thresher sharks, a family of three species found all over the world, have a very interesting hunting strategy. They get their name from their enormous, scythe-like tails, which can be several metres in length. When hunting, a thresher shark will use its tail to slap and stun fish, or even slice them in half! They are pretty big, too, with the largest species weighing up to 500 kilograms.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ccd5f078b2ce347d8f1d5d758b3e678f-lq)

*   Threshers, along with another shark family (the mackerel sharks), are among the world’s only endothermic, or warm-blooded, fish. They have heat-generating strips of muscle in the centre of their body, and an intricate, tangled system of blood vessels called a rete mirabile (“miraculous net”) to retain the heat produced. Mackerel sharks, or lamnids, are very energetic thanks to this trait - they’re the fastest sharks in the world.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-80c431f6f430f942d79dbfda68a34a0c-pjlq)

*   Another weird physiological feature that some sharks have is biofluorescence. If you shine blue light on a swell shark or a chain catshark, it will emit an eery green glow. Down in the deep sea, the only light that can penetrate the abyss from above is blue. By absorbing that blue light and reflecting it back as green, the sharks stand out sharply to each other in the depths. The fluorescent substances also seem to play a role in protection from bacteria.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-01c2467d5b59cc51c011ab9f37bc8341-lq)

*   Speaking of the swell shark, this species has a very unusual defensive behaviour which gives it its name. If threatened by a predator, it contorts itself until it can grab its tail with its mouth, before sucking up water, causing its body to inflate. In this engorged state, it’s very hard for a would-be attacker to get its jaws around the swell shark. The leucistic individual pictured below went viral as a supposed “alien" on Instagram in 2016.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-871ef4cccaa366c9d342ef46260f53c6-lq)

*   No shark, however, has been misidentified as a supernatural creature more times than the basking shark. On several occasion, mangled carcasses (“globsters") of this filter-feeding giant have led to wild speculation about sea monsters and living plesiosaurs. The most famous case was a decomposing basking shark, missing fins and much of its head, caught by the Japanese trawler Zuiyō Maru in 1977.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-635de4030f637e4ee2fb1dcf7760e973-lq)

*   While we're talking about prehistoric monsters, allow me to introduce you to the frilled sharks. This 84 million year old family contains two living species, which have hardly changed since the Cretaceous. With a serpentine form and a reptilian head, they certainly look the part. They lack the powerful jawbones of more advanced sharks, instead using the power of suction and a rather bizarre set of jagged teeth to tackle their prey (primarily squid).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0409f2ffd9ca7728c8385b98f4ec7ec1-lq)

*   The frilled shark isn’t the only living fossil under the sea - for example, the rare goblin shark’s lineage is even more ancient. It’s the last surviving species in the family Mitskurinidae, which is a staggering 125 million years old. Goblin sharks are characterized by a big blade-like snout which projects from their skull, and pink colouration they get from blood vessels beneath the skin. It’s likely that they are ambush predators, catching passing fish by shooting their protrusible jaws forward.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9f0e85c3dc4efea6c7e7d7dece58e966-lq)

*   The viper dogfish is another shark with a marvellously mobile mouth. Rather than snapping and biting its prey like other dogfish, this deepwater-dwelling species engulfs its poor victims whole. This is enabled by a special bone in the skull called the hyomandibula, which swings forward, rapidly extending the jaws far out in front to seize prey. Viper dogfish look about as horrific as you’d expect such gruesome sea monsters to look…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6e0df3e2c7a2d6d5b61a8396c6741c2a-lq)

*   Now, we move from the viper dogfish to the Portuguese dogfish. You’d think that the two were closely related, but the latter’s name is a misnomer; it actually belongs to the aforementioned sleeper shark family. The Portuguese dogfish has the distinction of being the deepest-living of all the sharks, with one specimen recorded at a positively crushing depth of 3,675 metres. Down there, it has to withstand 36 million pascals of water pressure.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e85f4a20b85cebdf901714fa36b8f65e-lq)

*   In 2001 at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, keepers were shocked to find their female bonnethead shark swimming around with a newborn pup, despite there being no males in the aquarium. Who fathered the baby? In truth, there was no father - this was the first documented case of parthenogenesis, or virgin birth, in sharks. The new shark was a perfect genetic clone of the mother, produced by the fusion of an egg cell and one of its inert “sister” gametes.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-48d50b09a1ae8bb602d7cd77a4896008-lq)

*   That’s not the only noteworthy thing about this species - it’s omnivorous, too. Yes, the bonnethead is the only shark known to eat plant matter; seagrass constitutes the majority of its diet. This must require some specialized adaptations in the digestive system, as the cellulose-rich grass would be impossible for other sharks to break down. It’s thought that bonnethead eats so much veggies in order to cushion its gut from the sharp spines of blue crabs, another dietary staple.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7ec7761933a91e8df563c198ccb9f2a2-lq)

*   Time to transition from one of the least specialized sharks to one of the most specialized, at least in terms of diet. The cookiecutter shark is the species I speak of.

*   No shark, however, has been misidentified as a supernatural creature more times than the basking shark. On several occasion, mangled carcasses (“globsters") of this filter-feeding giant have led to wild speculation about sea monsters and living plesiosaurs. The most famous case was a decomposing basking shark, missing fins and much of its head, caught by the Japanese trawler Zuiyō Maru in 1977.

*   While we're talking about prehistoric monsters, allow me to introduce you to the frilled sharks. This 84 million year old family contains two living species, which have hardly changed since the Cretaceous. With a serpentine form and a reptilian head, they certainly look the part. They lack the powerful jawbones of more advanced sharks, instead using the power of suction and a rather bizarre set of jagged teeth to tackle their prey (primarily squid).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0409f2ffd9ca7728c8385b98f4ec7ec1-lq)

*   The frilled shark isn’t the only living fossil under the sea - for example, the rare goblin shark’s lineage is even more ancient. It’s the last surviving species in the family Mitskurinidae, which is a staggering 125 million years old. Goblin sharks are characterized by a big blade-like snout which projects from their skull, and pink colouration they get from blood vessels beneath the skin. It’s likely that they are ambush predators, catching passing fish by shooting their protrusible jaws forward.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9f0e85c3dc4efea6c7e7d7dece58e966-lq)

*   The viper dogfish is another shark with a marvellously mobile mouth. Rather than snapping and biting its prey like other dogfish, this deepwater-dwelling species engulfs its poor victims whole. This is enabled by a special bone in the skull called the hyomandibula, which swings forward, rapidly extending the jaws far out in front to seize prey. Viper dogfish look about as horrific as you’d expect such gruesome sea monsters to look…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6e0df3e2c7a2d6d5b61a8396c6741c2a-lq)

*   Now, we move from the viper dogfish to the Portuguese dogfish. You’d think that the two were closely related, but the latter’s name is a misnomer; it actually belongs to the aforementioned sleeper shark family. The Portuguese dogfish has the distinction of being the deepest-living of all the sharks, with one specimen recorded at a positively crushing depth of 3,675 metres. Down there, it has to withstand 36 million pascals of water pressure.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e85f4a20b85cebdf901714fa36b8f65e-lq)

*   In 2001 at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, keepers were shocked to find their female bonnethead shark swimming around with a newborn pup, despite there being no males in the aquarium. Who fathered the baby? In truth, there was no father - this was the first documented case of parthenogenesis, or virgin birth, in sharks. The new shark was a perfect genetic clone of the mother, produced by the fusion of an egg cell and one of its inert “sister” gametes.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-48d50b09a1ae8bb602d7cd77a4896008-lq)

*   That’s not the only noteworthy thing about this species - it’s omnivorous, too. Yes, the bonnethead is the only shark known to eat plant matter; seagrass constitutes the majority of its diet. This must require some specialized adaptations in the digestive system, as the cellulose-rich grass would be impossible for other sharks to break down. It’s thought that bonnethead eats so much veggies in order to cushion its gut from the sharp spines of blue crabs, another dietary staple.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7ec7761933a91e8df563c198ccb9f2a2-lq)

*   Time to transition from one of the least specialized sharks to one of the most specialized, at least in terms of diet. The cookiecutter shark is the species I speak of. Using the round, fleshy sucker it has for a mouth, this shark famously latches onto larger animals and leaves a crater-shaped bite mark. Practically anything big enough is fair game, even humans. In the ’70s and ‘80s, several US Navy submarines were incapacitated by suspected “enemy weaponry” which turned out to be cookiecutter sharks!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b9188f3a6cbc12a68cf95aa4648d5103-lq)

*   You might have heard of sawfish, which, despite appearances, are a type of ray. There also exist sawsharks - sharks which have a long, flat snout, or rostrum, lined with sharp spines and a conspicuous pair of tendrils called barbels. The function of these barbels is not well understood - nor is much about sawsharks. It’s likely that they use their rostra more like swords than saws, slashing them from side to side to slice or bludgeon their prey.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-17a5acf3fb668bca2bd00b2620d5d87d-lq)

*   To counteract the several deep sea horrors you’ve seen in this answer, here’s an adorable deep sea delight: the pocket shark. It does not get its name from its diminutive size, but rather a strange pair of pockets it has next to its fins. No one really knows exactly what these pockets do, but the prevailing hypothesis is that they secrete some kind of luminous fluid. The species is still poorly studied, as it’s known only from one location, deep in the South Pacific.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-313f52f172a16e219046c224c47d2703-lq)

*   The biggest shark is of course the whale shark, which measures up to 18 metres in length. Like all sharks, its skin is covered in microscopic structures called dermal denticles, which are in fact modified teeth! It is, however, unique in the fact that even its eyeballs have their own layer of denticles, with several thousand on each. They most likely serve as armour, protecting the eyes, which lack lids and protrude out from the side of the head.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2545616823fdb3301dfef4aeec99bb2c-pjlq)

*   The angular roughshark is another species that has some unusual denticles. They are much larger than in other sharks, with each nodule being clearly visible. The largest denticles form a pair of rather strange-looking knobs above and below the eyes, which give the roughshark an amusingly weary appearance. Its tall hunchback and pig-like snout likewise contribute to this bizarre but humorous look.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-03426cf3f963a0887c368b357fe56f3b-lq)

*   An even more freaky-looking shark was found in Mexico back in 2011. It was a pale unborn fetus with one particular standout feature: it only had one eye. It wasn’t just missing an eye on the opposite side - no, its singular eyeball was in the center of its head, like that of a mythical Cyclops. Indeed, this genetic anomaly is known as cyclopia, and has been observed in human babies before.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-288d2f248aa99b85d6b002afdc577687-lq)

*   That’s not the only insane deformity sharks can have. Just last year, another oddball turned up off Sardinia - a blackmouth catshark which had neither skin nor teeth. Unlike the Cyclops shark, which was stillborn, this one was somehow alive and healthy! As the experts among you will know, skin and teeth tend to come in rather handy when you’re a shark, so it’s a mystery how this catshark managed to survive so long.

## The Manta Ray in the Mirror
    
**Upvotes**: 524 | **Comments**: 27 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-least-celebrated-animal-that-is-actually-really-smart/answer/Gary-Meaney)

From spotted hyenas to sun bears, there are lot of candidates, but I’m going to go with manta rays.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6d61a6706a341893f7be495d91f646a3-lq)

If you were to take a logarithmic graph, and plot every species of animal on it based on their body mass and brain mass, it’d tell you each one’s Encephalization Quotient, or EQ. In general, more intelligent animals have higher EQs (however, there are caveats to this, as dinosaurs, including birds, seem to have much denser neural tissue than mammals).

If you then took a close look at this graph, you’d notice something quite fascinating. Manta rays would be apart from all the other fish, instead clustered among the mammals. The EQ of the giant oceanic manta ray is higher than that of the brown rat, which - for a fish - is very impressive.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-10aa47071e1bf4992ae3ae7de847ff2b-lq)

However, relative brain size alone an intelligent animal does not make. Mantas are also demonstrate their intellect through behaviour. In 2016, [research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z "link.springer.com") was done on manta rays where captive individuals were presented with a mirror. This “mirror test” has been given to many animal species, but few have passed.

The idea is that if an animal recognizes itself in the mirror, it might be self-aware (this is another thing in ethology which has caveats to consider, but it’d take too long to explain them here). The tested manta rays certainly seemed to recognize themselves, acting very differently to how they would with another individual:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-801b21613e70580fe56491ad43a5c57d)

The researchers found that, I quote:

> The manta rays did not show signs of social interaction with their mirror image. However, frequent unusual and repetitive movements in front of the mirror suggested contingency checking; in addition, unusual self-directed behaviors could be identified when the manta rays were exposed to the mirror.

Overall, while it certainly isn’t conclusive proof that manta rays are self-aware, it does at least show that they seem to be more intelligent than any other fish studied thus far. They show plenty of signs of intelligence in other aspects of their behaviour, such as their curiosity and deep social bonds.

I think that all this goes to show that being able to manufacture and use tools is not as importance to the evolution of powerful brains as some might think. Anatomically, a manta ray couldn’t be less suited to tool use, and yet it is a remarkably smart creature.

## Beat the Heat With an Indestructible Ant
    
**Upvotes**: 12,607 | **Comments**: 187 | **Date**: [Updated Sep 27](https://www.quora.com/What-is-so-special-about-the-Saharan-silver-ants/answer/Gary-Meaney)

I did promise you guys that I’d write a full answer on Saharan silver ants, and it appears one of my readers has gone to the trouble of asking me the question for it!

These ants are truly remarkable creatures, easily one of the most interesting species in an already fascinating group. They can be found all across the more northern swathe of the Sahara Desert, a truly extreme habitat which has forced them to undergo some equally extreme adaptations. Here is why they are so unique.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-216595d8aad1742e5f5bcf97f3807f2a)

Living out in the deserts, these insects are faced with a problem. All through the night and for most of the day, predators like lizards run amok. This leaves only a daily ten minute window in which they can emerge from their nest and look for food. There’s only one drawback - the reason there are no predators about during this window is because it’s midday, when the heat is absolutely blistering.

But the tough little critters are up to the challenge. They can withstand up to 53.6 degrees Celsius (128 Fahrenheit) by producing incredible molecules called heat shock proteins, which help maintain cell structure during extreme temperatures.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-691f78a7d12c60cf8430540cdd03418b-lq)

All living things use heat shock proteins, but the ants are the only organisms in the world which can manufacture them at will, before they surface, instead of as an automated response to heat after the fact.

Another way that Saharan silver ants resist the beating sun is with their signature coat of silvery hair. They are not cylindrical in shape, like most animals’ hairs, but rather they are triangular prisms. This structure makes them highly reflective; in fact, they reflect away over 90% of the light which hits them. This is why they look so shiny, of course.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-861676629561f1645712db86c57a3f05-lq)

In order to gather enough food to feed an entire colony for a day in just ten minutes, they have to be quick - very, very quick. In fact, relative to their size, Saharan silver ants are the third-fastest organisms on the planet, topped only by a species of tiger beetle and a [Californian mite](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-animal-faster-than-a-cheetah/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com").

They can cover a full metre in a little over a second, which is over 100 times their body length! Very interestingly, they run with their front legs lifted off the ground (perhaps to increase speed, or reduce contact with the searing-hot earth), making them one of the very few quadrupedal invertebrates.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f05a859da49f5143edbf5d587aa28bac-lq)

So, have I convinced you that they’re special? You could make a strong case for ants as the most fascinating of all the insect groups, and Saharan silver ants are part of the reason why. Thank you for reading everyone, I hope you enjoyed this answer, and have a great day.

## The Gloves of Pain
    
**Upvotes**: 8,141 | **Comments**: 147 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-rituals-of-boys-initiation-into-manhood/answer/Gary-Meaney)

One of the most grim and brutal initiation rites in the world is that of the Sateré-Mawé people of Brazil. To become a man and a warrior, a boy must endure hundreds of stings from bullet ants.

Bullet ants are the only species in the world with a score of “4-plus” on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, which goes from 1 to 4. A single sting is described as causing “pure, intense, brilliant pain . . . like walking over flaming charcoal with a three-inch nail embedded in your heel."

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8dede09a50a832239b93a83462f47787)

In preparation for the rites of passage, countless bullet ants are rendered unconscious by a natural sedative. They are then woven into a pair of oven mitt-like gloves, 80 in each, with the stinging abdomens facing inwards. After the sedative wears off, the terrible ritual is ready to begin.

The boy must slip on the gloves and keep them on for a full five minutes, while singing and dancing, and maintaining his composure. For the next few days, he may shake uncontrollably, and parts of his forearm and hand will probably be paralyzed from the venom.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e39637330934f098a9bf3f351d85d302-lq)

The worst part? Over the next months, the boy will have to endure these five minutes of agony 20 times! Only then will he be considered a man.

So, kids - if you think your life is hard, at least you don’t have to experience the most painful sting known to mankind hundreds, if not thousands, of times, over. The Sateré-Mawé are the definition of hardcore.

## An Underground Metropolis as Big as Britain
    
**Upvotes**: 7,431 | **Comments**: 75 | **Date**: [Updated 2y](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-no-other-species-on-Earth-build-and-create-things/answer/Gary-Meaney)

In the Caatinga of Brazil, there is a complex of termite mounds, constructed by the species Syntermes dirus. It is quite similar to any other typical termite colony, except this colony is approximately the size of Great Britain.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-23d04d8795559f44639785c5d7676045-lq)

Covering an area of roughly 228,000 square kilometres, this immense complex contains over 200 million mounds, each 10 meters in diameter and 3 meters tall. The termites have excavated about 10 billion cubic metres of soil, and so Herculean a feat this was that it took them nearly 4,000 years to construct.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dc235838d43e69d51e6fae64ebd3f0e5-lq)

This is a construction on a grander scale than virtually any structure humans have built. And all this by creatures tens of millions of times smaller than us! Someone who wonders if other animals can build things would, by their logic, also wonder if humans can.

## The Acacia and the Ant
    
**Upvotes**: 5,349 | **Comments**: 31 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-secondary-benefits-do-animal-defense-mechanisms-grant/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Acacia trees like defense mechanisms so much, they evolved a defense mechanism from a different defense mechanism.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e69812229fdcb3efe1baeb71496844ea-lq)

Acacias are covered in thorns, which of course make them difficult for herbivores to eat. Although some animals, such as giraffes, have extra-long tongues and prehensile lips to negotiate the spikes, overall they’re quite effective.

However, many species in the Acacia genus have gone a step further, and evolved hollow passages - known as domatia - in their thorns. These tunnels are the perfect place for an ant colony to set up shop - and that’s exactly what the trees want.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ad494302e2bda679822bb20555349ade-lq)

While insignificant to us, in the insect worlds, ants are bad news. Using ridiculous numbers, as well as biting mandibles and formic acid secretions, to overwhelm virtually any target, many species of ant are, on an invertebrate scale, the ultimate predators.

So, when they colonize the thorns of the acacia trees, any tresspasser in the area will either be killed by the ants or driven away by them. This includes all the pesky herbivorous insects which gnaw away at the acacia leaves. Essentially, the ants become the tree’s own suite of security guards.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8364dc08ddecf21ecc6ba93e13cce0c7-lq)

It’s not only the domatia that the plants offer to their six-legged tenants. Many species of acacia also have these little buds on the tip of each leaf. These are known as Beltian bodies (above) and are in fact high-protein snacks for the ants.

A handful of species, such as A. colinsii, also produce another form of ant food - extrafloral nectar. This sugary secretion is not - as nectar usually is - found in the flower, but instead simply secreted from the body of the plant. All in all, the ants get accomodation and free meals, and the trees get an army of defenders. Seems like a pretty good deal to me.

## Kamikaze Ants and Exploding Termites
    
**Upvotes**: 3,726 | **Comments**: 106 | **Date**: [Oct-01](https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-the-only-animals-which-are-known-to-intentionally-blow-themselves-up/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Surprisingly, no. In fact, there’s a whole zoological term for the act of intentionally causing oneself to explode: autothysis. This behaviour is observed in two different groups of animals - ants and termites.

* * *

Both are eusocial insects, meaning that most individuals do not reproduce, and are thus genetically “expendable”. It wouldn’t make much evolutionary sense for a normal animal to go around blowing itself up instead of passing on its DNA, after all.

A couple of ant genera use autothysis. The workers of these ants are full of highly corrosive sludge, which they use to their advantage while in combat with rival colonies. When they contract their abdomens, their whole body ruptures, and the substance oozes out.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-aa32aee8e1cd18a01c28806a7173cb92-lq)

Of course, they die in the process, but for the greater good of protecting their colony. The yellow goo they release burns any enemy which touches it, and is also very sticky, meaning any other foe which walks in it thereafter may get stuck and perish.

Autothysis is even more widespread in termites, as it is a feature of many species. However, they apply the strategy a little differently. In the case of an attack on the colony, soldiers (or, in some cases, workers) stand at each entrance and rupture their bodies. Their carcasses block all the tunnels into the nest, providing a defensive barrier against the onslaught of rival termites.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ba5a0af1d8501958662f3b1b780cdd22-lq)

One species, Neocapritermes taracua, takes things up a notch by combining the tactics of both ants and other termites. When the workers get old, they become poorly suited to their original duties - ultimately, they are worth more dead than alive.

Copper crystals start to form in a pouch on their abdomen, a deadly backpack, if you will. When the termites self-destruct, they react with chemicals produced by the labial glands to form toxic molecules called benzoquinones.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0025b1b6304fde62c5083decc352d099-pjlq)

So, those are two different types of animals which deliberately blow themselves up to protect their colonies. As a fun aside, I’m going to introduce you to a plant which explodes, too: Himalayan balsam. Native to the world’s highest mountain range, it is now considered an invasive pest in many countries.

In order to spread its offspring to new pastures, Himalayan balsam seed pods burst open when ripe, if they are disturbed. Seeds go flying up to seven metres in all directions!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d2e79779a7006761db82d3f38b1e5a86-lq)

Anyway, that’s all from me for today guys. I hope you enjoyed this shorter-than-usual answer, have a great day!

## The Cruellest Fly
    
**Upvotes**: 3,645 | **Comments**: 129 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-cruelest-insect-in-the-animal-kingdom/answer/Gary-Meaney)

There are some very nice answers to this questions already, but there’s a type of insect which I think deserves inclusion here too - the strepsipterans. Also known as the “twisted-winged insects”, this is an order of parasites which is quite nasty to its hosts, and yet fascinating for so, so much more.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-618d617bf14af102e9315cf931ca6015-lq)

Let’s cover the basics. Strepsipterans are probably the weirdest of all the insect orders. Their eyes, for example, are really freaking weird. All insects have compound eyes, whereby each “ommatidium” forms a pixel, and together the thousands of ommatidia create a complete image. All insects… except strepsipterans.

Instead, these guys have a few dozen “eyelets”, and each one is a fully functioning eye that produces a complete image. In fact, this eye structure is more similar to that of the ancient trilobites than to any extant arthropod group. It makes their eyes look a lot like blackberries.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3d8f74cf303d8dc656e32b691ef6cf77-lq)

What’s most bizarre about this order, however, is the ridiculous sexual dimorphism. Males are only very weird; they’ve got the trilobite eyes, and the adults don’t have mouths, as they only live for about five hours. Otherwise, they more or less resemble flies. Females, on the other hand, are downright absurd.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4e6011ff674b6c5cf2a36e8cad97ad50-pjlq)

In the figure above, the photos labelled a and b are of adult females. They’re neotenic: they never metamorphose, instead remaining larval blobs for the rest of their lives. They don’t have wings, eyes, or legs.

But I’m getting distracted - this is the “cruel” part of strepsipteran biology. The females are parasites of many types of arthropod, including grasshoppers, cockroaches and praying mantises. As little larvae, they invade their host through chinks in the exoskeleton, and will never leave. The insect below has several females parasitizing it.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a78d0d4dbd0ee4b71ae795c462fe7363-lq)

The larvae grow and grow (but, as said, never metamorphose into adults), until they may constitute 90% of the volume of the host’s abdomen! As research in the 90s has shown, it’s likely that insects feel pain, and this must be an excruciating experience for the unfortunate victim of the females. If that wasn’t bad enough, they often castrate their hosts.

But the life cycle just gets weirder. The females begin to exude a scented pheromone which alerts males in the area as to their location. When a male finds one, he’ll mate with her via hypodermic insemination. Basically, he stabs right through the host’s exoskeleton and into the female with a razor sharp reproductive organ - strepsipteran cruelty at work again.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e5a25158d580f03876a028c7449bd1ec-lq)

The female’s eggs are fertilized, and later hatch. However, she does not lay them before they do so - instead, the babies emerge internally and just swim around her insides for a while. Eventually, they’ll emerge through the wound from the male’s violent insemination, which is pretty damn metal. The female will later use up all her host’s available blood and starve to death, alone.

And so, the bizarre, fascinating and gruesome life of a female strepsipteran comes to a close. Like so many of the animals I’ve written about in my answers, they’re highly underappreciated for their weirdness and uniqueness. Thanks for reading, and thanks for the A2A Sean.

Ooh, I’ve been waiting for a question like this. I love to show off the beauty of animals, especially underrated ones. Here are my nominations:

*   Jewel caterpillars, family Dalceridae. Both mesmerizing and strangely edible-looking, their exoskeletons are covered in gelatinous beads which give them their name.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f2adda50d4af26935c941e701c368870-lq)

*   Another type of caterpillar (I have a thing for caterpillars), the Wattle Cup caterpillar. Though its adult form is a dull moth, the larvae are colorful and have huge stinging tubercles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-77d84ff4df741b73303d1b44d6a42a08)

*   The ant Echinopla striata, a Southeast Asian species related to carpenter ants, which is a striking metallic blue. This is a very obscure species so there’s virtually no other information on it.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d54f6d249b53119e50e6e8b80c4784ed-lq)

*   A species of darkling beetle known as Eucyrtus gloriosus (the specific name of course meaning “glorious”), which has a lovely color scheme of shiny purple and gold.

*   The passionvine treehopper, also known as the fluffy bum. Yes, seriously. They have a tuft of white filaments on the end of their abdomens, which can be moved up and down and are used for display.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4840857f061406806a18b7cd2d1e5e63-lq)

*   The endangered trilobite beetle, Platerodrilus sp. Obviously, they’re not actually related to trilobites, but are named so due to their flattened bodies and large scales. They can be huge, too - 8 centimetres long when fully grown.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-25bed9d23134f0091c1f77704fd14785-lq)

*   The larvae of agrid sawflies, which are deep purple in colour. They resemble caterpillars greatly, but there are differences - mainly different numbers of legs and eyes.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-96626e50c6e900abbdc8d92248ae1577-lq)

*   The incredible-looking lace bugs, family Trilinidae. Their wings are beautiful, reminiscent of stained-glass mosaics. The intricate, lace-like network which causes this appearance is what gives them their name.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-01bb5cc151461e02e8424e128b17670b-lq)

*   Stick insects which, like scorpions, are fluorescent under ultraviolet light. Normally they may look drab, but when exposed to UV light they take on this alien appearance.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0e7e06bcb5268d0ac7d0bdeba648d324-lq)

*   Eumastacid monkey grasshoppers, which come in many different colours. They hold their hind legs horizontally, at right angles to the body, which is bizarre indeed.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-45eb361806ccee77d1e2f1a2818dcd7f-lq)

*   There are many beautiful mantises, but I think orchid mantises are the most out of all of them. They’re probably the least obscure species on this list, and mimic flowers to deceive both predators and prey.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-176d34307f4861f297e7aad09ce15758-lq)

There are many more breathtaking insects, and these are just my obscure few suggestions. A lot of people don’t realize how diverse insects really are.

EDIT: A suggestion from [Michalis P.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michalis-P-2 "www.quora.com"); the steelblue ladybird (or ladybug if you’re American), Halmus chalybeus. These carnivorous beetles are a startling iridiscent blue-green and definitely qualify.

## The Jesus Beetles Among Us
    
**Upvotes**: 2,376 | **Comments**: 160 | **Date**: [7mo](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-common-organisms-that-most-people-dont-even-know-exist/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Rove beetles. It’s hard to even explain how ubiquitous these insects are; they are found in just about every habitable corner of every continent in the world, including Antarctica. There are a staggering 63,600 species, making the rove beetle group (Staphylinidae) the most diverse taxonomic family of organisms in existence.

Despite their abundance, I’d wager that most people haven’t heard of them. That wouldn’t be much of a shame if they were just dull bugs, but rove beetles are one of the most interesting insect groups out there. Hopefully, by the end of this answer, you’ll love them as much as I do.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-814f8d864b5e2ba0269f7c13e4a29593-lq)

The defining characteristic of rove beetles are their very short elytra, or wing-cases. In beetles, elytra (singular elytron) are hardened wings reinforced with chitin, which protect the paper-thin flying wings below. Most species’ elytra reach all the way towards the tip of the abdomen, but rove beetles’ are half this length.

How, then, do the wings fit underneath? They are in fact folded up, origami-style, so that they unfurl to full length when the elytra are lifted. They can then be tucked in again by an intricate sequence of asymmetrical folds. This amazing design is [being researched](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/46/16349 "www.pnas.org") to help aerospace engineers design compactable, folding aircraft wings.

You can watch the process in beautiful detail [in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhU9NhHIYQc&t=1s "www.youtube.com")

Now, I’m going to talk about the incredible genus Stenus. Like the family it belongs to, it’s record-breakingly diverse: it contains more known species than any other animal genus, at 3,000. Most are specialized predators of springtails (little six-legged arthropods which aren’t quite insects, but closely related).

To catch these springtails, they employ a frightening weapon. The labium (an insect mouthpart, sort of like their lower lip) is shaped like a harpoon, and the beetle inflates it with blood to make it shoot out in a matter of milliseconds. The end of the rod is tipped with sticky pads, which can grab prey from up to half a body-length away.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7e13a282125369def8149fde6f04c0a0-pjlq)

In other words, they’re like the chameleons of the insect world.

Stenus beetles’ main method of defence is just as unique as their main method of attack. They mainly live on and around water, as they’re light and leggy enough not to break the surface of the water. This in itself isn’t unusual for an insect - many arthropods, even some reptiles and Jesus can walk on water.

However, when Stenus species are threatened, glands in their abdomen squirt out a substance called stenusin - a compound produced exclusively by, and named after, them. It has exceptionally low surface tension, meaning it’s hydrophobic - it repels water. Instead of mixing with the water, it spreads over the top of it, allowing the beetle to slide away at breakneck speed.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4b5b0ecffdb9310a5be6cfd9a97c837a)

This escape maneuver is so lightning-fast that it’s never been photographed or filmed, to my knowledge. Instead, have the above diagram of a stenusin molecule.

Stenus rove beetles tend to be fairly consistent in colour, with most species being black or reddish-brown. Other genera, however, are much, much more colourful. Many species have iridiscent, rainbow-like exoskeletons:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-83ffc57ff30a62500682dc8224ee85db-lq)

One species, Emus hirtus, has even evolved to mimic the more dangerous bumble bee:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5e251b9ce1552f41d9b3a289e40ce732-lq)

Another, Staphylinus erythropterus, imitates a specific species of ant. It’s found in Ireland, my home country.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-564eb921738cf9c4f1ac602665909b81-lq)

Most rove beetles are ground-dwelling predators of smaller insects - however, with close to 64,000 species, there are plenty of outliers with different lifestyles. Surprisingly, there’s only one species known to be eat live plants - Himalusa thailandensis, discovered in 2010.

Some genera, such as Myotyphlus from Australia, clasp onto the hairs of small mammals like mice and rats, as pictured below. This isn’t bad for the hosts, though; the rove beetles eat the insect parasites on their fur, so the relationship is in fact symbiosis. It’s like a micro-scale version of oxpeckers and buffalo.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6f39fb0613d570570831336270c6366b-lq)

One very common species found across the Northern Hemisphere, the hairy rove beetle, is a scavenger which feeds on carrion. It’ll also chow down on maggots which are eating the same carcass. There are a quite a few detritivorous rove beetles, but this one is especially interesting for a quirky reason…

When a dead human body’s been around for a while, chances are there’ll be some hairy rover beetles on the scene. Their scavenging habits are well-studied, so their presence (or absence) helps forensic scientists estimate the time of death, or post-mortem interval.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dadc104b9dde14f5b33badd33590d049-lq)

And they’re not the only useful rove beetles. Delia fly larvae, known as root maggots, destroy the roots of crops. Many species in the genus Aleochara are parasites of Delia flies - more specifically, they’re parasitoids, meaning they kill their hosts. Because of this, they’ve been employed as a pest control organism.

After it’s born, an Aleochara beetle burrows into one of the flies’ puparium - the shell of skin which protects the developing maggot. It then lives inside this shell, slowly vacuuming up the maggot like jelly in order to survive. Once it’s done eating, it cracks out of the puparium and begins adult life.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-663ac095c9c4aa47a87e64b715f56df4-lq)

There are even many species of rove beetle which live right by the ocean - about 400 in total. The most well-known is the pictured rove beetle, found on North America’s West Coast, which digs tunnels in the beach sand. It stays under here during high tide, when the coastline is submerged, and comes out at night to hunt sandhoppers.

The pictured rove beetle is perfectly camouflaged: its colouration even varies depending on the local sand type. Up in Alaska, they are darker to blend in with black volcanic beaches, but in California, they’re pale beige.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bb3693634e942e64099c067e352fb364-lq)

However, where things really get crazy is with the myrmecophilous rove beetles - those that live in close association with ants. These are divided into three categories: “unwanted guests”, “tolerated guests”, and “welcome guests”.

Unwanted guests, or synecthrans, live on the outskirts of ant colonies. Some of them use the ants’ “cemeteries” to lay their eggs, so their young can feed on discarded ant carcasses. Others prey directly on members of the colony.

To combat the army of ants, synecthrans employ an arsenal of chemicals. Some produce the very same signal pheromones as their hosts, so that they can essentially fool attackers into thinking there’s no threat. Others spray compounds which disorientate the ants for long periods.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f93c4d568de7c5532e803a7af552882a-pjlq)

Tolerated guests, or synoeketes, use a variety of strategies to go unnoticed by the colony. Some just stay out of the way, feeding only on discarded waste or fungi. Some species mimic the ants themselves, being indistinguishable from the real thing, by the real thing. The insect on the right, below, is a rove beetle:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-859d5e08f65f05af86a8e594b9c8126d-lq)

There are also those which are simply built like tanks, and thus not worth the effort of attacking. These typically have very strange anatomy - they’re shaped like broad teardrops, and covered in armour plating. Because of this, they are extremely hard for ant jaws to get a grip on, so the hosts sort of have to tolerate them.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ba7d7f96df98498e66d5296b9c20593a-lq)

Lastly, you have the welcome guests, or symphiles, which have been fully incorporated into the ant society. Think of these like “employees” of the colony - they help with feeding and raising young, transporting food, grooming and much more. In return, they are fed by other ants through trophallaxis (mouth-to-mouth vomiting, basically).

In order to essentially live permanently as ants, symphile rove beetles have modified their ancestral body plan drastically. Their mouthparts have disappeared in order to take part in trophallaxis, and many of the segments in their abdomens have fused together. It takes one look at the species below to see that this is not your typical rove beetle.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-25d09cddb6288f4d00dceef7df77d7ae-lq)

The species detailed in this answer are just a handful of the many tens of thousands there are known. And that’s not even considering all the ones which are unknown - hundreds of new rove beetles are discovered every single year. In tropical regions, it’s estimated that we’ve barely uncovered a quarter of their diversity.

So, it’s a given that there are still more amazing, unique species in this family which we’ve yet to see. Thank you, everyone, for making it through this very lengthy ramble about beetles, and I hope you have a great day.

## Turtle Ants, Toad Bugs and Owl Flies
    
**Upvotes**: 1,438 | **Comments**: 62 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-coolest-arthropods/answer/Gary-Meaney)

I can’t seem to stop answering these types of questions, but they are pretty fun and usually well-received, so let’s give it another go.

Owlflies

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-34b90ef7d0919676e7b5159a9a8ff223-lq)

Ever heard of a [wobbegong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobbegong "en.wikipedia.org") shark? Well, imagine that, but on land, plus enormous mandibles wider than the body. That’s a fair description of an owlfly larva. What’s super cool about them is that some species actually cement sand and debris into their exoskeleton to serve as camouflage, kind of like a tank might with foliage and bushes.

The adults resemble dragonflies in many respects, with the most noticeable difference being their huge, club-tipped antennae, used for balance in flight. Some owlflies actually mimic wasps in their adult morph, like many other insects.

Fairyflies

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6ef9896f60f40c27ea1d61c74f3ec510-lq)

This is an insect - an insect the size of a protozoa, that is. I’m not kidding - these wasps are the most diminutive insects in the world, with the smallest weighing in at 0.0000025 grams, and being about 0.1 millimetres long.

At such a small size, flying is nothing like we could ever imagine. The viscosity of the air makes it soupy, so the smaller fairyflies have to practically swim through the air - hence the bizarre, paddle-shaped wings pictured above.

Pennella

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-808b4fe175fc3f6c49862660bcdfe6cf-pjlq)

Copepods are a type of planktonic crustacean, and they’re usually microscopic. Pennella is a definite exception - in fact, some have been recorded at roughly 1 foot in length! The females cling to the skin of fish and squid as blood-sucking parasites.

The largest species - P. balaenopterae - even infects whales. Several cetaceans have been found covered in the repulsive copepods, which create nasty welts as they burrow deep into their host’s blubber.

Hangingflies

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-23054544d03589ac20bc2350106fef15-lq)

This is what you get when you cross a fly, a spider and a monkey. Using their long, spindly forelimbs, they simply hang from blades of grass all day, using their huge legs to snatch insects which fly past. They’re so specialized for hanging and grabbing that most species can barely walk.

Some hangingflies have an interesting mating ritual where the male presents the female with a captured prey item. If she judges the catch to be of sufficient quality, the male will get to mate with her.

Toad bugs

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eba93f447298256c62eab43c5d3b9d76-lq)

The name is pretty accurate here, given that these insects are warty, squat amphibious animals which have bulging eyes, eat flies, and move by hopping. Found in riverine environments, they are capable swimmers and usually prefer very moist locations.

One especially interesting species of toad bug is Gelastocoris oculatus. It is highly variable in terms of colour - in a single locale, you might find black ones, gray ones, mottled brown ones and even green-and-red ones.

Macrocheles rettenmeyeri

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9ca7b07ec5c2aff57c74d86b6a84a614-lq)

This one is criminally obscure for such an amazing creature. This mite will search for an army ant, and then bite off its foot so it can latch on instead, sucking the ant’s blood (or haemolymph, to be strictly accurate).

What’s really fascinating, though, is that the mite actually serves as a perfectly good foot, and one study suggested that it might even improve the performance of the leg. Besides that, very little is known about these creatures.

Turtle ants

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f668ea858b9fd60e27d333be63295129-pjlq)

This has got to be one of the coolest ants out there, and that’s saying something. Cephalotes soldiers have bizarre heads which are huge and flattened, looking almost like dishes. In the event of the colony being attacked, the soldiers use their massive heads to plug the nest’s entrances (that’s the round thing in the photo).

The strategy is apparently very effective. Commonly known as turtle ants, another cool fact about them is that, using their legs, they can perform a rudimentary form of gliding. Lastly…

Onychocerus albitarsis

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-63ae03890695951aa0b4dac8dc78c753-lq)

Long-horned beetles are famous for their enormous antennae, which are usually longer than the body, and give them their name. Onychocerus albitarsis puts a cherry on top by having venomous stingers on the end of their antennae. As O. albitarsis is a herbivore, they likely have a solely defensive purpose.

It’s actually the only truly venomous beetle among 350,000 other described species, though some leak/spray toxins rather than actually injecting them. Thankfully, the stingers don’t pose a threat to humans, though they may cause “mild swelling”.

* * *

Those are 8 really obscure arthropod taxa which deserve a lot more love - hopefully this answer will earn them some more fans. There are of course many other species in this enormous phylum which I could have showcased - not to mention all the bizarre extinct groups - but I’ll leave it at these for now.

## Vomit from a Living Larder
    
**Upvotes**: 1,270 | **Comments**: 35 | **Date**: [9mo](https://www.quora.com/Can-insects-be-fat-obese-If-so-what-does-it-look-like/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Most mature insects have a hard, chitinous exoskeleton which prevents the body from expanding. In order to grow, arthropods have to shed this skeleton and grow a new, larger one. This process is known as ecdysis.

As such, when they enter a caloric surplus, they don’t really get “fatter”, they just get… denser. Insects store fat as droplets of lipids encased inside the cells of a special organ called the “fat body”. These lipids get packed in more tightly as fat is gained.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ceb0666af81e0e36f0e5dd0d3df00eaf-lq)

However, something along the lines of visible fattening can happen to underdeveloped insects, whose exoskeletons aren’t yet so inflexible. Larvae like grubs, maggots and the like put on fat pretty quickly, and can actually enter a diabetes-like condition when this happens in excess.

As a stomach-churning side note, scientists have extracted larval fat and experimented with it as a possible substitute for dairy butter. Apparently, an unpleasant taste was only noticed by test subjects when about 50% of the butter in a cake was replaced by the insect fat.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6e7a2f9ee79cf15621e27d5875c9119f-lq)

There are also certain insects which look engorged, “obese” even, but not due to body fat per se. Somehow, I’ve never written about honeypot ants in all my three years on Quora, but today is a good opportunity to remedy that.

Honeypot ants have a special caste of workers called repletes. These living larders are fed on pollen and nectar until their abdomens distend to spherical proportions. During lean times, the other workers tickle the swollen repletes’ antennae, causing them to vomit up the digested food - delicious.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e90142afab4d0a805898803669ab8d3c-pjlq)

Since I’ve already ruined your appetites with the larval cake tidbit, I might as well go ahead and say that people eat these insects too. The repletes are a common delicacy for some indigenous Australian groups; while most ants taste quite citrusy due to their formic acid, honeypot ants are very sweet, thanks to the nectar within.

So, in short: when most insects put on fat, they don’t change outwardly, they just pack it on more densely. However, larvae with less rigid exoskeletons can get visibly fatter, and other insects do swell up due to food itself rather than stored fat. Thanks for reading, everyone!

## Walking Berries and Mummified Mothers
    
**Upvotes**: 746 | **Comments**: 29 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-coolest-grossest-weirdest-or-most-interesting-thing-you-know-about-a-certain-insect/answer/Gary-Meaney)

It’s hard to single out a certain one so I’ll give a few here. First of all, some caterpillars.

Eupithecia is a diverse genus of moths - and I mean diverse. Wikipedia has over 1,400 pages each on a different species of Eupithecia. However, there are three species which are especially interesting - E. storioris, E. staurophagma and E. scoriodes.

These species - all of them native only to Hawaii - are the world’s only carnivorous caterpillars. They lie in wait, mimicking twigs or stalks, until a prey item passes by. In the blink of an eye, they snatch the prey with their monstrous forequarters. Their legs are tipped with great hooked claws for disemboweling victims.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ea587276ff5c4f381df20ae0d11eab2c-lq)

Another type of caterpillar - the amphibious caterpillar (12 species) - is also only found in Hawaii, and it is the only insect which lives as readily in water as it does on land. Furthermore, they’re the only air-breathing animals in the world which can survive being submerged for a full month.

They don’t have gills, but they don’t come to the surface to breathe either. Their method of respiration is more unique; they absorb oxygen through pores in the skin. In fact, they actually require water - specifically flowing water - to breathe! They also build silk coccoons, tethered to the riverbed, to stop them from being carried away.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-746f460c4c90ca698f4b63314fc506b0-lq)

Slug caterpillars are aptly named - for they resemble, in many respects, slugs. They appear rotund and gelatinous, and have lost many of their legs, which they have traded for octopus-like suckers. Those legs that do remain are highly reduced in size and use liquefied silk as a lubricant to help the caterpillar move.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9127d0f7139870a37852176587295092-lq)

Now, bagworm moths. Once a bagworm moth hatches, it immediately begins building a sort of “log cabin”, a boxy case built of wood. These cases come in many shapes and sizes, and I wish I could show more here. The moths eat and even defecate in their little house, and the females never leave it in their whole lives.

When it is time to mate, the male bagworm moths emerge from their cases and fly away to find potential partners. The females are flightless, since they stay in their cabins, but they do have vestigial wing-like structures.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-19c3a76cfcede82ff94347f8c6daf8b0-lq)

You probably know that bees make honey from nectar. You probably don’t know that some bees make honey from the anal secretions of greenflies. However, you almost certainly haven’t heard of vulture bees, and how they make their honey.

Vultures bees - 3 species, genus Trigona - make honey exclusively out of meat. When they find a carcass - be it a reptile, amphibian, fish, bird, or even a primate - they swarm all over it, entering through the eyes and chewing it up with saw-like mandibles. They churn the flesh into a sort of soupy meat pulp, which they convert to honey.

However, I think the most bizarre group of insects, in my opinion, are Callipappid scale insects. They start their lives as weird, mite-looking things called “crawlers”. When the females metamorphose out of that nymph stage, they become legless, waxy lumps called “cysts”, pictured below. They look kind of like wilted berries.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-370d02599197487b029bfddc3e910f91-lq)

Meanwhile, the males are tiny flying things. However, since the cysts live underground, latched onto tree roots, they can’t get to the females. So - get this - the lumps regrow legs, break free, and walk once again! They crawl up to the surface where they can mate.

Now, the female stores her eggs in a marsupial-like pouch, and dies. Before long, the carcass turns into a leathery mummy. And then, believe it or not, the newborn crawlers burst out of their mother’s corpse! They then burrow underground, attach to a root, and, if female, become shapeless cysts.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c21e4a7b85b36806c899a50a12e71804-lq)

Those, in my opinion, are just a few of the weirdest, most interesting insects. Admittedly I could go on for quite some more. Most people know that insects are a diverse lot, but perhaps they don’t quite grasp just how diverse they really are.

## The Cockroach and the Batmobile
    
**Upvotes**: 692 | **Comments**: 26 | **Date**: [Sep-03](https://www.quora.com/Aside-from-human-beings-do-any-land-animals-ride-other-animals-for-transportation/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Yes, this is surprisingly common in nature! Here are some of my favourite examples.

First of all, leafcutter ants. Chances are you've heard of them; they harvest blades of grass and leaves, carry them back to the nest in an orderly line, and feed them to underground colonies of fungus, which in turn produce little nutritious blobs (called gongylidia… I love that name) exclusively for the ants.

This symbiosis in itself is very interesting, but another unique thing about leafcutter ants is their polymorphism. The worker ants are divided into four separate castes; in ascending order of size, they are termed minims, minors, mediae and majors. The mediae are the ones who cut and carry the leaves, but you often also see little minims “hitchhiking" on the plant matter.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b7d8770e9af7acbb65aff00fa55a2efb-pjlq)

These hitchhikers house bacteria which secrete antimicrobial chemicals, preventing microbes which would be harmful to the fungus crop from contaminating the leaves. They also defend the carrier below, warding off phorid flies which might attack it. While this behaviour isn't strictly for transportation, I still think it's worth mentioning as it is fascinating.

Another insect which hitchhikes is the helmet cockroach, Helmablatta louisrothi. Termites aside, this species may well be the most bizarre cockroach in the world, and that's really saying something. It dwells in the volcanic caves of Vietnam, and it's instantly recognizable thanks to its helmet, which resembles a halo.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f8acd43d83cb4042c1ce664b75c643b9-pjlq)

There is a lot I could write about this wacky little guy, like how it grazes on underground fungi, or how it lures potential mates with a scented secretion, how it has the proportionally largest head of any cockroach, how it's flightless but still has wings, or how the males have claws on their back used to hold the female in place during mating.

However, for our purposes, I brought up the helmet cockroach because - being flightless - it will instead hitch a ride on a bat when it wants to travel! Now that's what I call a Batmobile! t even has a special hook on its dorsal side which it seemingly uses to affix itself to the bat's fur.

Now, we go from under the ground to under the sea with slipper lobster larvae.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5e61d59afbcef4d7f829d3e74dbd40a3-pjlq)

Before reaching adulthood, slipper lobsters go through an underdeveloped phase during which they are termed phyllosoma larvae. They are transparent, tiny, and have long spindly legs. All things considered, they’re not the best adapted to swimming long distances.

But they don’t need to, because they invest in personal transportation - unwilling jellyfish. They hop onto the bell of a passing jellyfish, and ride it as it drifts through the depths, sometimes eventually killing it due to the added weight. And if that wasn’t convenient enough, they also begin to chew away at their host, fueling their growth! Unfortunately, the larvae do not have ice cream to accompany their jelly.

I should also mention that when they do grow up, slipper lobsters are still really, really weird…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fb08a2ffa6000bc2c7d14292c053edaf-lq)

If that doesn’t look like an alien creature I don’t know what does. You see those broad flaps sticking out of the front of the head? Those are actually its antennae, which have evolved into an unrecognizable form.

Moving on, we have another crustacean, and another outlandish oddball: Phronima. It’s a genus of amphipod, which - as you would expect from a freaky sea beast - lives in very deep waters. There are ten different species.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-831a2200e917f54e0aa24dc2d7fc4bca-lq)

That massive “crest” at the back of its head, which makes it look awfully similar to a Xenomorph, is in fact a massive extra pair of translucent, tube-shaped eyes! And that’s not even the strangest part about Phronima. The hazy blob encasing it is a creature called a salp, which is essentially just an aimlessly-floating, barrel-shaped sack of transparent flesh.

The Phronima pictured above is not using the salp for its own transport, but rather for transporting its young. It has torn out the gelatinous viscera of the poor salp, and will lay its eggs in the resulting hollow, before propelling it away so its offspring can hatch elsewhere, in fresh territory.

Next, let’s take a drastic turn away from this series of nightmarish arthropods and move to something cute and fluffy. Let’s talk about Virginia opossums.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-66482ac16c8722e7489a3a48150ccd3c-lq)

Being marsupials, and in fact the only marsupial species native to North America, baby opossums are born in their mother’s pouch. They spend the first part of their life here as blind, fleshy jelly beans, as marsupial young do not spend as much time developing inside the mother as placental mammal babies.

However, when they grow older, the little opossums often like to ride atop mom’s back while she forages. Up to twenty can fit on one mother! In a similar vein, I should briefly touch on shrews.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-15aa3869f68bd6e711613809657b33fb-lq)

They don’t really ride each other, but baby shrews do travel in conga lines of up to eight, with the mother at the front, and each child carrying the tail of the shrew ahead in its mouth. Hang on a minute, isn’t there a movie about this? Anyway…

That’s enough adorable furriness for one answer, we have to circle back to marine invertebrate Lovecraftian horrors. As such, I will continue this tangent by introducing Synophalos. Just like the shrews, this extinct, 515 million year old arthropod travelled in connected chains.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d01240b60d50f23c29fbbf2ae5611ed9-pjlq)

Because this species is so damn ancient, and its body plan is dramatically different from that of any modern arthropod, we know very little about Synophalos and its place on the evolutionary tree of life. However, like so much of the Cambrian fauna, we know it was really cool and extremely weird.

That’s all from me, guys, I hope you enjoyed this answer. Thank you all very much for reading, have a good day.

## The Trump Hair Caterpillar and Co.
    
**Upvotes**: 657 | **Comments**: 50 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-remarkable-caterpillars-discovered/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Ooh, I’m glad I came across this question. I happen to have a soft spot for caterpillars; they’re among my favourite arthropods, and they’re a lot cooler than you think. I know I say that in practically every answer I write, but it’s true. Here we go, then.

*   Hickory horned devil: This 15-centimeter giant is probably the largest caterpillar in the world. Easily one of the weirdest insects in the contiguous US, its vivid colours and elaborate spikes give it a fearsome appearance, despite it being totally harmless. It metamorphoses into an attractive orange, grey and white moth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-60f39ab917cbe5afe73c0446ad03bc96-lq)

*   Amphibious caterpillars: These 12 species (which, as of yet, have no Latin names) are endemic to Hawaii. They are the only insects which are truly amphibious, and can survive underwater longer than any other air-breathing animal - up to a month! They do this using respiratory pores in their skin and actually require flowing water to breathe.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-10b9f512f5ec62db6d09c4b3366b3f4b-pjlq)

*   Carnivorous caterpillars: Another Hawaiian endemic, these 3 species in the diverse moth genus Eupithecia are unique for their predatory habits. They lie motionless in wait, mimicking twigs or stems, until an insect flies by, which they snatch using the terrible hooked claws on their forelimbs. Scaled up, these would be terrifying predators.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-63d9c7316206febe8c977689f62ce470-lq)

*   Snail-eating caterpillar: Like the previous creature, this one is both carnivorous and only found in Hawaii. They feed only on land snails, catching them using nets of silk. They then crawl inside the snail’s shell and eat it alive, from the inside out. And get this - they decorate their bodies with their victim’s shells, likely for camouflage reasons.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ff6e1ec1b9dd30b133feecd048c05fcb-lq)

*   Slug caterpillars: The larvae of this family (Limacodidae) are so named for their slug-like appearance. They’re rotund and gelatinous, and have suckers, rather than legs, on their undersides. They move via rhythmic rippling of their belly and a kind of liquefied silk which functions as a lubricant.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-06e4d12e68e3807dc2ae2b86d3422617-lq)

*   Spun glass caterpillar: While it is in the slug caterpillar family, I had to give this one a separate bullet because it’s so incredibly beautiful. Looking like a handcrafted glass ornament, it’s covered in transparent crystalline barbs which can give you severe dermatitis if touched. They’re mainly found on the East Coast of the USA and feed on oak leaves.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8e6b204a8559d917b8239f154759b688-lq)

*   Jewel caterpillars: This family of moths, Dalceridae, is often confused with the slug caterpillars, as the larvae of both families are gelatinous in appearance. They’re covered in jelly-like mucus, and when predators - like ants - try to attack, they get stuck in this goop and starve. You should also look up an adult jewel caterpillar moth - they’re beautiful too.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d46ff42f3860bc5e3a886e59ee3f4fc8-lq)

*   Flannel moth caterpillars: These caterpillars are instantly recognizable, as they’re covered in a coat of long fur (which is actually venomous setae, so don’t touch one), which can be yellow, brown, white, or even curly. One species, found in Peru, looks remarkably like Donald Trump’s hair, which has gained it Internet fame.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f0ddd1a207daa5f6b2cee0f98aff5633-lq)

*   Hag moth caterpillar: It’s easy to see why this critter is nicknamed monkey slug, what with its brown furry appearance and limb-like appendages. These “arms”, of which there are six, are able to detach and regrow without any harm to the caterpillar. While some people report no symptoms, others may experience irritation after touching its tufts of setae.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0cfb37c81eef3b7b2ad649e72d9ee71a-lq)

And that’s all I’ve got, for now anyway. While we’re here, here’s a fun fact about caterpillars - they turn into butterflies, right? Wrong. Well, mostly - about 90% of the caterpillars there are, and probably an even higher percentage of those you’ve encountered, metamorphose into moths, not butterflies. Anyway, thanks for reading.

## When Insects Play Dress-Up
    
**Upvotes**: 602 | **Comments**: 42 | **Date**: [Sep-12](https://www.quora.com/Why-among-all-the-living-species-on-this-planet-only-humans-care-about-their-body-beautify-it-and-transform-it/answer/Gary-Meaney)

There are innumerable species which care very much about the appearance of their body. In most animals, one sex tends to be picky about who they mate with. This is generally the females - since they bear the young, they invest a lot more energy into reproduction than the males, and thus ought to have the most genetically gifted offspring possible. They want more bang for their buck, in other words.

So, to impress prospective mates, hopeful animal suitors employ a vast array of “sexual display” tactics. The most common strategies include dances, displays of dominance over competing males, impressive structures on the body such as antlers, and of course vibrant colouration.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f00cb4267bb3def407923cc6f05bffe5-lq)

However, beautification and transformation of the body is far from as universal as that. In fact, I can think of only one non-human example of an animal deliberately altering its appearance with external material in order to be more attractive: the bearded vulture.

Also known as the lammergeier, the bearded vulture is a fascinating bird - up to 90% of its diet can consist solely of bone, and one individual is thought to have killed the famous ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus by dropping a tortoise on his head.

Bearded vultures also frequently bathe themselves in dust and mud which is rich in reddish iron oxides. The result is that, despite their actual plumage being white underneath, they always have a vivid red, orange or gold colour.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bfba9fc69c0ace55d1404ce0781bbac2-pjlq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5d4c50ee10625369af1f85a4af8deb63-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-49648be7cd07e364761ef31c343770b8-lq)

They do this for no apparent reason other than to beautify themselves, making this behaviour both a very interesting example of tool use and the only instance of cosmetics in the animal world (that I’m aware of).

That being said, it is quite common for creatures (invertebrates, mostly) to get dressed up not to attract attention, but to avoid it. This is known as self-decoration camouflage, and has cropped up a surprising number of times in evolution. First of all, there are insects, such as Acanthaspis petax.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fba3952bf75bf9436c33698e6b9c3a15-lq)

This East African creepy crawly kills ants, sucks out their organs with digestive enzymes, and stacks their desiccated carcasses atop its back in order to camouflage itself. This may be to break up its silhouette, or just to render itself unrecognizable to predators. Whatever the case, it’s metal as hell.

The young nymphs of another assassin bug species, the masked hunter, coat themselves in dust and sand to blend in with the environment.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-449baae86d552cb5bf10feb9e28aa86a-lq)

Caddisfly larvae wear protective “cases” - tubes of sticky, secreted silk which are covered in debris such as pebbles, shells, and plant matter. One artist gave some captive larvae pieces of gold and gemstones to build their cases from, with beautiful results.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-553738c2d54737443be69a2f5ae7f270-lq)

The larvae of many lacewings also like to wear debris, although this is to disguise themselves from potential prey. Like Acanthaspis petax, they often cover themselves in the corpses of their past victims; aphids in this case. Eventually this leads to them looking like some abomination from The Thing.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6a9f6e9203b357f4d6db18c36f48fcd2-lq)

In fact, insects have been using debris to camouflage for a long, long time. Hallucinochrysa, an extinct 100 million year old insect from Burma, did the exact same thing.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-453f4beb24086c18d2dc908bceb9aa6b-pjlq)

Self-decoration camouflage can also be observed in the oceans. The textbook example is the aptly-named decorator crabs, of which there are around a dozen species. They attach sponges, crinoids, bryozoans, algae and other aquatic organisms to their carapaces, helping them go unseen by predators.

Some species even recruit venomous or otherwise harmful animals, such as stinging anemones, hydrozoans and noxious seaweeds, which are even more effective at warding off attackers.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1983dd68896b0fe97b6301e7f5ab2787-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0b5302a9b8029e1ff5af6f80f1c5b706-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-130eca08950bb5e8c4e6af4193fb1b84-lq)

The rather pretty candy crab has similar habits; it attaches live coral polyps to its spiny shell for camouflage.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-51572cd7c126100ddd99a89e8f1c6d85-lq)

Also, when threatened by predators such as sharks, octopuses may wall themselves up within seashells, although this tactic may have more to do with armouring than hiding. There’s a common octopus beneath the shelly lump pictured below.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3c4520b8f183ab3b83c52563c3559313-pjlq)

So, long story short, self-adornment is a frequent occurrence in the natural world, but most of the time it’s for camouflage rather than beautification. It also seems to be restricted to marine life and insects, which I assume is because carrying around heavy debris is very hard on land, unless you’re really tiny.

I should, however, also mention that there are animals which decorate their environment so they can be more attractive. A shining example would of course be the bowerbirds, a family of avians native to Australia and New Guinea. The males build structures from twigs, or bowers, and then festoon them with colourful trinkets, like berries, flowers or even man-made objects.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6d271ab8d8baae396817077d037e557f-lq)

They colour-code the decorations, and sometimes even arrange objects according to their size so that smaller ones are closer to the foreground. This suggests that bowerbirds have a pretty sophisticated sense of aesthetics and that they understand perspective, which in itself is fascinating.

* * *

Anyway, thank you everybody for reading. I hope you found this answer interesting, have a great day.

# Other INVERTEBRATES

## The Barnacle Blob that Hijacks Crabs' Crotches
    
**Upvotes**: 2,708 | **Comments**: 128 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-oddest-lifeform-ever-discovered/answer/Gary-Meaney)

The other answerers’ submissions are all well and good, but If I’m honest, I think I can do them one better with these critters.

Rhizocephala

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f977dcd28854cb6e041602bc19f5f0cc-lq)

If I was to bet on the most bizarre animal in the world, my submission would be the barnacles of the superorder Rhizocephala. They’re also pretty spine-chilling, and of course they’re parasites too.

A Rhizocephalan begins life as a larva called a nauplius. It is this stage in the life cycle alone that identifies them as a crustacean, let alone a barnacle, they’re so absurd. This is a Rhizocephalan nauplius:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c7e3c28ac4fbb3e51530295382c5d4c4-lq)

As crustacean larvae go, they look fairly standard, except for one thing - they completely lack a digestive system. No mouth, no gut, no anus. As such, the larvae don’t eat at all; they just float around and molt several times.

After they’ve molted enough times, they become an adult, or cyprid. The normal barnacles you see encrusted on rocks at the beach are in the cyprid stage. However, a Rhizocephalan cyprid is absolutely nothing like that of any other barnacle.

They have no legs or appendages, no segmentation (both crucial features of all other arthropods), and virtually no internal organs except a handful of muscles and reproductive bits. If the cyprid is female, it’ll attach itself to an unwitting host - usually, a crab, but sometimes a shrimp or other decapod.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-40734d0254db9444f9262baa50879dca)

Once it attaches, it metamorphoses into the final stage. The female literally injects most of her internal cell mass into the crab. This shapeless soup of cells becomes a network of roots which snake throughout the inside of the host’s body - these roots are collectively known as the interna.

And, yes, it’s going to get a lot, lot stranger. Where the crab’s reproductive organs (now eaten by the barnacle) once were, a large bulbous sac grows - the externa, pictured above. Here’s some more externae (externas?), marked with the letters “ex”.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b6d2f15f2d50741c12dc1fccf424633f-lq)

For now, the externa is immature, but that’s about to change. Up to this point, we’ve only been talking about the females. Meanwhile, the males have not left the cyprid form and are still swimming about.

When males find the female, they latch onto her externa, and like she did to the host, inject their internal cells into the sac. Once inside - get this - they transform into nothing but a few, free-swimming sperm-forming cells. That’s all. This makes them both the simplest males in all the animal kingdom and the most sexually dimorphic creatures in the world.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1e8770c4cac398a2faae4fdd79364a86-lq)

(Human spermatogenic cells, couldn’t find any Rhizocephalan ones)

Now, the now-mature female ejects her eggs into the internal cavity of the bulbous externa. The males - or rather, what was the males - fertilize these eggs and die. The fertilised eggs transform into two morphs: large eggs which will hatch as females and small eggs which will end up as males. When they hatch, the cycle restarts.

* * *

There's one last thing I'd like to mention. To top it all off, the barnacle exerts a sort of mind control on its host. Even if they're males, the crab is somehow tricked into thinking that the externa is its egg sac, and it will care for it like it would its own young. What's more, because they've been castrated, they don't have the hormones which cause them to molt, so the Rhizocephalan is in no danger of falling off.

## The Beast That Ate Amelia Earhart
    
**Upvotes**: 2,526 | **Comments**: 89 | **Date**: [Aug-26](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-largest-terrestrial-arthropod-that-is-commonly-eaten-by-humans/answer/Gary-Meaney)

That would be the coconut crab. It’s not only the largest terrestrial arthropod commonly eaten by humans, but it’s the largest terrestrial invertebrate, full stop.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-489cbd5d0c7d181f834cf87cbf137387-lq)

This colossal crustacean can weigh up to four kilograms, and its leg span measures a metre across! When coconut crabs start out in life, however, they look nothing like that - in fact, the babies (known as zoae) begin as microscopic plankton floating in the sea.

If these teeny weeny larvae survive long enough, they metamorphose into larger forms, called glaucothoes. The glaucothoes find seashells - or, sometimes, broken coconut shells - to wear as protection from predators.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e0b65ad58b00379956b869002c0ece22-lq)

Eventually, they surface and take to dry land, growing larger still and shedding their old shell. Instead, they develop a remarkably tough exoskeleton, reinforced with chitin and calcite. This has a defensive purpose, but also serves to prevent water loss outside the sea - one of the many adaptations coconut crabs have for the terrestrial way of life.

In my opinion, the most interesting of these adaptations is their respiratory system. They have a very unique organ called a branchiostegal lung, essentially an inside-out set of gills which absorbs atmospheric oxygen, rather than the dissolved oxygen of the sea. This has to be kept moist at all times, so they frequently use their back legs to rub it with water.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-22851b4afd333f19a4caff20621887bd-pjlq)

Coconut crabs also have an excellent sense of smell, which of course works very differently to that of their aquatic relatives. Interestingly enough, their olfaction is quite similar to that of insects, a case of convergent evolution.

As you can probably guess, this sense of smell is used to track down food. They usually eat fruit, nuts, coconuts, seeds, and the like, but they are far from fussy, and will gladly eat carrion, or even kill live rats, turtles, and seabirds! The photo below is a pretty damn nightmarish shot.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c75fa01a22dcb8b940a7db497b61d0fc-lq)

Speaking of eating, and more relevant to your question, coconut crabs are considered a traditional delicacy on many of the islands they inhabit, especially the more remote ones. This is one of the main threats to the species, as they are classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN.

That being said, it’s possible that the crabs have had their revenge against us humans. I’m sure you’re all familiar with Amelia Earhart, the pilot who had to make an emergency landing on a far-flung isle of Kiribati, and whose remains were never found.

Believe it or not, some people theorize that this is because her body was picked clean by scavenging coconut crabs…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4912bd7e573ab49e5ea6863df5b02d97-lq)

Though it may seem far-fetched, I’d say it’s certainly plausible. While investigating this, TIGHAR (The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery) ran an experiment involving coconut crabs and a large pig carcass. It was stripped to the bone in a couple of weeks, and its skeleton was dismantled by the crabs shortly thereafter.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b15cca6cba60a1da163b8b5b8497f7cb-lq)

Now, some bonus facts which are worth knowing about these guys. The coconut crab has a pretty far-reaching distribution across much of the Indian Ocean, and some of the Pacific, too. It’s found (mainly on small islands) from East Africa to Southeast Asia to French Polynesia.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-38f71d5e15d711d92699cb98c20c545a)

The wicked claws of the coconut crab are a serious force to be reckoned with. Their pinch strength has been measured at a bone-cracking 3,000 newtons, in comparison to studies which find the average man’s pinch grip to be 87 newtons!

Anyway, hopefully that was a good rundown of this unusual and frighteningly huge species of arthropod. I myself would be curious to taste one, though hopefully I would not befall the alleged fate of Amelia Earhart and be tasted.

Thank you very much for reading, have a great day.

## Zoology's Greatest Mystery
    
**Upvotes**: 2,414 | **Comments**: 75 | **Date**: [Updated Sep 28](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-living-biological-mysteries/answer/Gary-Meaney)

One of zoology’s greatest unsolved mysteries surrounds the obscure facetotectans. They are a subset of crustaceans, and have been found in all the world’s oceans, from the Arctic to the tropics. Eleven different species are known thus far, but it’s likely if not certain that more remain undiscovered.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1dfe94e9a13a13e9732e926a1a785921-lq)

We’ve been finding them since 1887 - well, that is, we’ve been finding their larvae. To this day, nobody has seen an adult facetotectan. We don’t know what they turn into when they grow up. So far, we have identified two larval stages in the wild. The first stage is known as the nauplius, and looks like this:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-408864e956bf084d8d50e34fc74fc845-pjlq)

Nauplii have a rounded shield covering their head, and a stubby tail. They can be as little as 0.025 cm in length. Each nauplius actually goes through five separate slightly different forms, called instars, before metamorphosing into its second stage of development: the cyprid.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3779424342f9d2ea8a7a676ea5f3530f-pjlq)

Cyprids are a bit larger, and a little more recognizable as crustaceans, with a functioning pair of eyes and a long, segmented body. Those little appendages that look like legs are actually its gills, although they can be used for walking. The cyprid form can also secrete some kind of adhesive substance.

We have made one breakthrough towards figuring out what grown-up facetotectans look like. In 2008, a team of researchers injected cyprids with a growth hormone called 20-hydroxyecdysone. This stimulated them to shed their exoskeletons and progress to a new phase of life. The results were… bizarre, to say the least.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5013464d5928fb936d22c6c911eb42fc-pjlq)

This new form was not an adult, but some kind of juvenile stage which they dubbed the ypsigon. Its eyes and muscles had all but worn away, and had neither limbs nor segmentation - it was little more than a microscopic slug. Similar to earthworms, ypsigons move via peristalsis - contracting and relaxing in a rhythmic, wave-like motion.

The discovery of this form was a tantalizing step towards solving this mystery. Perhaps adult facetotectans have eluded us by being parasites, living hidden inside larger organisms. If this is the case, it would be one of several curious similarities between this group and another outlandish type of crustacean…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fe079911698068fb5b2bef356c7517ba-lq)

If you’re familiar with some of [my older answers](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-oddest-lifeform-ever-discovered/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"), you may recall the rhizocephalan barnacles - in my opinion, the strangest animals on the planet. They too start out life as primitive nauplii, before morphing into squishy degenerate forms and parasitizing other animals. Facetotectans are indeed very closely related to barnacles, so they may have more in common with rhizocephalans than we thought.

It may be a long time before we discover the true identity of these creatures, but I have a feeling that whatever they turn out to be will be unexpected. Thank you for reading, have a great day.

## Heavy Metal in the Animal Kingdom
    
**Upvotes**: 1,815 | **Comments**: 20 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/Have-there-ever-been-any-extinct-animals-to-have-metal-in-them/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Yes, absolutely. Your skeleton is made of calcium phosphate, one of the components of which is of course calcium - a metal. Your blood is full of hemoglobin, made largely of iron. Magnesium and zinc help your muscles contract and the manufacture of your DNA.

If you mean the more stereotypical image of metal as a shiny, uh, metallic plating, then the answer is still yes. This is the scaly-foot gastropod, who has a shell plated in iron sulfide. It has a visible metallic shine.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-02f54b289a6cc5c34f65fc0f2842159d-lq)

The foul, repulsive bloodworm, a type of polychaete worm, has hooked teeth which are made out of copper.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c315cce9bb755762dd23468daddd2f16-lq)

For these animals to exist, they must have had prehistoric ancestors. Unless these metallic organs are extremely recent innovations, there would have been extinct animals which shared their traits.

## Eyes of Aragonite
    
**Upvotes**: 1,575 | **Comments**: 40 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/Which-animal-has-the-weirdest-eyes/answer/Gary-Meaney)

If there’s one group of animals which can compete with the outright weirdness of mantis shrimps’ eyes, it’s the chitons. Chitons, or polyplacophores, are sea-dwelling mollusks which essentially resemble armoured slugs. They have a shell composed of eight plates, or valves, and will curl up into a ball when threatened.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-111ccedc1be27b5999ff323f0fa32d7e-pjlq)

All chitons have organs known as aesthetes, which are patches of light-sensitive cells, under their shells. However, many species have gone a step further and evolved full-on eyes, lens and all.

Chiton eyes are… bizarre. Thousands of them cover the shell, so that together they act as a much larger compound eye and grant the chiton 180 degree vision, which by itself is pretty amazing. However, what’s weirdest about these eyes is what they’re made of.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ba989677417ca73741a2ba99c373b89f-lq)

Their lenses are made out of the same mineral, aragonite, as the rest of the shell, so chitons could be said to see with their armour. They’re the only animals in the world which have eyes made of rock!

If that wasn’t enough, chiton eyes evolved more recently than any other animal’s eyes - they appear in the fossil record about 10 million years ago. A fascinating organ for a fascinating group of animals. As an aside, this is the largest chiton, the gumboot chiton:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-02fc67021fb36c7db99aa3547d813462-lq)

Growing to 36 centimetres in length, it’s often referred to as the “wandering meatloaf”. Unlike other chitons, it has a layer of leathery skin over its shell, and eats using rows of teeth made of magnetite.

We’re getting really off track now, but as a final fun fact, researchers in California took inspiration from the growth of gumboot chiton teeth to develop a new way of growing nanomaterials for batteries and solar cells. It’s a great example of biomimicry.

## Nose-Leeches Like to Watch Movies Too
    
**Upvotes**: 1,526 | **Comments**: 17 | **Date**: [Aug-24](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-weirdest-things-people-have-done-in-the-name-of-science/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Yi-Te Lai is a Taiwanese parasitologist (parasite biologist) who studies leeches. In 2019, while writing a paper on a poorly-understood leech known as Dinobdella ferox, Lai went above and beyond expectations to advance our knowledge of the species.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b4ae2b06b1abee1fa1362ad9a9360ccc-pjlq)

Dinobdella ferox is a member of the praobdellids, a nasty family of parasites which, unlike other leeches, do not suck blood from the exterior of their hosts. Rather, they attach themselves to the mucous membranes, found inside the body. D. ferox enters via the nose, or worse, the anus, or worst, the urethra.

In order to document the life cycle, habits and symptoms of these nasty leeches, Yi-Te Lai voluntarily inserted one into his nose not once, not twice, but three times! At the time of infestation, each Dinobdella was a few millimetres long:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5ce24c4c88314d43aa2a40f3d336a2a5-pjlq)

The worm then stayed in his nasal cavity for as many as 75 days, sucking his blood all the while. He noted effects such as nosebleeds, stinging up his nostrils, and inflammation of the mucous membranes. He took regular blood tests, and frequently monitored his tenant by endoscopy (that in itself is already quite an invasive procedure!)

As each leech gorged itself, it enlarged at a sickening rate. In one of the three trials, it increased in size three hundred and eighty-fold! They were often externally visible towards the end of their stays, due to their size. Hopefully none of them decided to stick their head out while he was talking to people…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-66b077d6ec0936974d4a39b905f957f5-pjlq)

Speaking of which, Dinobdella ferox seems to develop a longing for the outside world after it’s done blood-sucking. Specifically, it seeks out damp and dark places. This proved to be awkward in some situations, as they’d start emerging while Lai was washing his face, showering, or watching a movie at the cinema!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c42b82c78d1db9631006d8495a493993-pjlq)

At the end of each trial, after the nosebleeds stopped (presumably meaning the leech had finished feeding), Lai managed to coax his nose-dwelling friend towards the nostril by holding his face over a bowl of water, and then pulled it out by hand.

* * *

Many people would be utterly horrified and baffled as to why someone would do this, but I personally have a lot of respect and admiration for Yi-Te Lai’s dedication. Because he voluntarily infected himself with these blood-sucking parasites, we now know a lot about a once-mysterious species.

If my description of the procedure interested you, I strongly recommend you look him up on YouTube, where he posted his observations every step of the way. Thank you for reading, have a great day!

## This Spider is Smarter Than You
    
**Upvotes**: 1,264 | **Comments**: 50 | **Date**: [Dec-19](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-neurologically-advanced-group-of-arthropods/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Neurological advancement is a very difficult concept to define or measure, and perhaps not even one that really exists. However, what I think you’re getting at is what’s usually vaguely referred to as “intelligence”; in other words, behavioural complexity.

So, which arthropod has the most complex behaviour? The excellent [Ken Saladin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ken-Saladin "www.quora.com") makes a well-argued case for the wasps in the genus Ammophila in his answer. Here, I will write about an additional candidate for the title: Portia jumping spiders.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5f520c718c27cda76b48093ad5acf39f-lq)

Most Portia species live primarily by hunting and eating other spiders, sometimes double their own size. In order to take down their fearsome prey, they employ a wide variety of incredibly complex strategies, indicating that they have some degree of “intelligence”. They even have special tactics for each type of spider they pursue.

If Portia is stalking a web-building spider, it will be extra careful to avoid being spotted, as these targets are extremely sensitive to subtle vibrations they detect on their web. The Portia might take extensive detours up to an hour long in order to find the optimal angle of attack. Amazingly, it will even wait for gentle gusts of wind to tread on the web, masking its movements to the prey.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-49b881fc8b1366d5d4ede1a3f95aa607-lq)

Another crafty ploy that these jumping spiders use on web-building spiders is mimicry. They sometimes make deliberate vibrations on the web’s silky threads, imitating the struggles of an entangled fly or the beckoning of a potential mate. The victim is lured to its death by these deceptive signals.

One of the most dangerous types of spider that Portia is known to hunt are the spitting spiders, pictured below. The name is an apt one: to dispatch threats, their mouthparts expel twin jets of toxic fluid in a peculiar zig-zagging pattern. This fluid is a combination of silk and venom, which together produce a sticky net to trap unsuspecting prey.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-032a789ca5e16b22b85698ac13bde96e-lq)

When on the hunt for spitting spiders, Portia will always approach from behind, out of reach of the deadly spray. That said, if it’s a mother carrying eggs they seek, they attack head on, because the enemy’s spitting mouthparts are occupied, holding the egg sac.

Occasionally, they go after other jumping spiders. These opponents present their own set of challenges: namely, acute vision. Rather than hunt them down in the open, Portia lie dead still and mimic forest detritus. Only when the jumping spider prey has walked close by do they strike.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9d7d5cf5945dbfdb2708a7a820ace6cf-lq)

One might argue that all these hunting strategies are just pre-programmed instincts that have been wired into them from birth, and not really indicative of intelligence. However, research has shown that Portia spiders have the cognitive capabilities to, when confronted with totally unfamiliar hazards, invent and remember effective new tactics through trial and error.

Portia seemingly even have basic social abilities. One species, P. africana, has been observed in East Africa living in groups and sharing food amongst one another. They are also able to distinguish between the silk threads spun by different individual peers, a trait which might imply some basic form of sociality.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-79d8706eb3b3b28c3dc5887e90ee8fc0-lq)

While they may not be on the level of birds or mammals, it can’t be denied that Portia jumping spiders are incredibly intelligent. There are very few invertebrates which come anywhere near them in terms of behavioural complexity and inventiveness. That, I think, is as good a method as any for determining which arthropod is the most “neurologically advanced”.

## The Four-Eyed Butcher in the Deep
    
**Upvotes**: 1,106 | **Comments**: 56 | **Date**: [Oct-18](https://www.quora.com/What-real-life-animals-are-the-most-similar-to-the-Xenomorphs-from-Alien/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Thankfully, we haven’t come across any Xenomorphs in the real natural world. Yet. However, there certainly are a handful of very real creatures which have characteristics in common with the movie monsters. One group of animals that came to mind for me would be caecilians.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0a261f4a457cb94876c845f81fdd8ae5-lq)

Though they could be mistaken for worms, caecilians are in fact legless amphibians. Up close, you can see their sharp teeth and sometimes even their saliva, which recall the dripping, drooling jaws of a Xenomorph. One species - the ringed caecilian - is thought to possibly even have venom glands in its fangs.

There’s a lot more about these amphibians that makes them fascinating. They are nearly blind, can be up to 1.5 metres long, secrete toxic substances which can induce hemolysis, and have a pair of sensory tentacles in front of their eyes, as well as an extremely complex array of jaw muscles and hard calcite scales embedded within their skin. I suppose they deserve a full answer of their own someday…

Anyway, back to the aliens. In the movies, they have a second, inner set of jaws within their mouth. There are in fact real life animals which have this same feature - moray eels.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fefdebb3e46bfa7fc9a93f8343ba0f7b-lq)

Many fish have what are known as pharyngeal teeth; teeth located deep in the their throat. However, morays are unique in having a fully functioning, articulated set of pharyngeal jaws. When they open their mouth, these jaws lunge forward to grab onto prey, and retract as the mouth is closed.

Most fish swallow their food by using suction: they create a pressure differential between the surrounding water and their mouths, vacuuming up their victim. Moray eels cannot really do this effectively, as they live in cramped underwater tunnels. Instead, they have Xenomorph jaws.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d697862f161c8b0d70711113b87f482d-lq)

Another sea creature which bears an uncanny resemblance to the fictitious extraterrestrials is Phronima, a deep-sea crustacean (an amphipod, to be more specific). In addition to its plated exoskeleton, it has what looks like a long crest extending from the back of its head, just like a Xenomorph. Despite appearances, this is in fact a huge pair of tubular eyes!

Weirdly enough, this is but one of two pairs of eyes Phronima has. Even stranger are its habits; a mother will track down a salp (a kind of gelatinous, sac-shaped animal), hollow out its viscera with her claws, and lay her eggs within the unwilling hosts. The disemboweled salp floats away with the current, and her offspring eventually emerge in new territory. Much like a chestburster!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7f85e34c571a5383cee2e967acd2de8a-pjlq)

Even more like chestbursters are parasitoid wasps. There are well over half a million species of parasitoid wasp, all from various different groups which have independently evolved the same grisly habits. They are united by their parasitic lifestyle - more specifically, they are parasites who kill their hosts, or parasitoids. There are myriad different ways they carry out their life cycle - far too many to discuss right now. Perhaps they too need a future answer.

Anyways, the most famous strategy employed by parasitoid wasps is the laying of eggs within a larger host - usually a caterpillar, though practically any kind of insect is used by one wasp species or another. When the eggs hatch, the newborn larvae begin to eat their host from the inside out, eventually emerging to the outside world like a baby Xenomorph.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-17f51314ed38aca5f464bedd841d2132-pjlq)

The last animal I will bring up is Prasinohaema, a genus of tree-dwelling skinks found only on New Guinea and the neighbouring Solomon Islands. These lizards have an extraordinary tolerance for the acidic chemical biliverdin. We, too, contain biliverdin, but in minuscule quantities, and an excess of the stuff causes jaundice. If enough of it is present, we die.

The bloodstream of Prasinohaema skinks has a biliverdin concentration forty times higher than that lethal dosage! Believe it or not, their blood is actually bright green because of this content, making them one of only three vertebrates which don’t have red blood. In any case, this reminded me of the acid blood of the aliens.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-039b91525a3a36d416ede5ffbebf6ce6-lq)

So, that’s my out of this world lineup of five curious creatures which meet your criteria. I hope you found this answer interesting, thank you all very much for reading, and have a great day.

## An Island Ruled by Killer Centipedes
    
**Upvotes**: 867 | **Comments**: 17 | **Date**: [Mon](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-land-on-Earth-where-vertebrates-do-not-dominate/answer/Gary-Meaney)

One would think that, with vertebrates having ruled the world’s terrestrial ecosystems for hundreds of millions of years, it would be impossible for such a place to exist on the modern Earth. Surprisingly, one would be wrong. There is one spot which is so small and remote that no predatory land vertebrate of decent size has managed to colonize it - but something else has.

The location I speak of is Phillip Island.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8dde7e0069b193d77c610485c9d828a5-lq)

It lies off Norfolk Island, a distant Australian territory, in the stretch of the Pacific sandwiched between New Zealand and [New Caledonia.](https://www.quora.com/Which-island-has-the-most-unusual-plant-life/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") It’s pretty tiny, stretching a couple kilometres from end to end, and pretty barren, with no real human settlement. The scenery on Phillip Island is hauntingly beautiful, a fact it owes to its volcanic cliffs and bright red earth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7a829f1a0f06b5b6ab21b96832d8d86a-lq)

In terms of wildlife, there’s not an awful lot going on, to say the least. The island is home to two species of lizard, and about a dozen types of seabird roost on its cliffs. All of these animals are at risk of falling victim to the formidable apex predator of the landmass: the Phillip Island centipede.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1d3cd93427c109cd45a23f73a08d803e-pjlq)

With a nasty pair of mandibles and an extremely venomous bite, this arthropod has become a specialist hunter of vertebrates - fish, skinks, geckos, birds… in other words, anything and everything which crawls, swims or flies on its island. Often, it slays animals many times larger than itself, though that’s not to say it’s small - it measures more than 23 centimetres, or 9 inches, in length!

In particular, the centipede is partial to chicks of the black-winged petrel, Phillip Island’s most ubiquitous seabird. Despite outweighing their predator by far, the chicks are defenseless while holed up in their burrows, and are typically eaten alive. Every year, nearly 4,000 birds fall prey to centipedes. This is not a concern for conservationists, however, as natural predation is all part of the balance of the ecosystem.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-436fe4a65d74fbae1ac316a33b8f35ee-pjlq)

As said, they don’t just eat seabirds - the two native species of lizard are frequent prey too. Here’s a great photo of a centipede chowing down on a Günther island gecko.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ed1b7e8e4c79cdbc4a8951ecdd90a093-lq)

Remarkably, this incredible carnivore was only described in 1984. At the time, Phillip Island centipedes were exceptionally rare, as the intrusion of foreign mammals like rabbits, pigs and goats had caused massive ecological disruption on the island. In fact, they gave the place its signature ochre hues, by destroying the vegetation that was holding the topsoil together. As you can see, erosion ensued.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-09025db5bdcc603ae569523e3c691ab2-lq)

Thankfully, these invasive species have since been eradicated, and Phillip Island is healing. Plant cover is returning, so lizards and birds are returning, so the centipedes are returning. Given that we’ve only formally known about these creatures for 37 years, I suspect that we still have much to learn about their biology and habits. I eagerly await any breakthroughs or discoveries.

In a world where it can seem like mammals dominate the planet, it’s nice to know that there’s a remote island out there somewhere where a giant bird-eating centipede rules the roost. If you liked this answer, you might also enjoy [this one](https://www.quora.com/What-places-are-there-in-the-world-where-mammals-are-not-the-apex-predator-on-land/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") of mine from a couple years back.

* * *

Well folks, this one was a little on the short side, mainly due to the fact that there just isn’t that much we know about the Phillip Island centipede… for now. Regardless, I hope you enjoyed the answer. Have a great day.

## The Mightiest of Mites
    
**Upvotes**: 862 | **Comments**: 43 | **Date**: [Aug-15](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-interesting-mite/answer/Gary-Meaney)

I’ve written about a lot of super-obscure and seemingly drab animals before, but you could still be forgiven for assuming that I couldn’t think of a single remotely interesting type of mite. And you’d be right. I can think of five.

* * *

First, Adactylidium. If you thought its name was a mouthful, just wait for some of the creepy crawlies you’ll see coming up next! Biologists were initially perplexed when they studied the males of this species - after being born, they would not feed or mate, and die within hours. How could they possibly reproduce?

Believe it or not, their reproduction occurs before birth! Adactylidium females have one male offspring and at least five females in their “womb”. Inside his mother’s body, the male impregnates the unborn siblings, who then kill their mother from the inside out and crawl their way to the outside world, carrying young of their own.

So, their only purpose in life is to be incestuous and matricidal - a sad existence…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dbbe6d256a4952070003b3d002e895cd-lq)

Next up, the South California mite. Relative to its size, this little arachnid is the fastest animal on the planet, by far. It’s less than a millimetre long, and dashes at speeds of around 0.8 km/h. That might not sound like much, but it means it can run 322 times its own body length in a single second! For comparison, a cheetah sprints at up to 16 body lengths per second.

If humans were that fast (proportionally), we could run at over 2,000 km per hour, nearly as fast as the top speeds of some fighter jets. Of course, small size is part of why the South California mite is so speedy - they have fewer cells than a large animal, and thus they produce less excess heat when moving at high velocity.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-74231faf10b50345c9980dfac62297ba-pjlq)

Thirdly, we have not just one species but a whole family of mites - the halarachnids. That being said there are only ten species in the family, which is tiny by arthropod standards. They are still super interesting though! Halarachnids are unique among mites in that they inhabit the oceans - but not in the way you’d think.

They live solely inside the nasal cavities of seals, sea lions, fur seals, walruses and otters, as parasites. In large numbers they can give the host severe respiratory ailments like pulmonary emphysema. And it gets worse - there has been one documented transmission to a human. He was sneezed on by a walrus while visiting SeaWorld!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-954f30b8bcc5a6b7ec42f0d1214bd95a-lq)

Our next mighty mite is Macrocheles rettenmeyeri. Try saying that three times fast. This one is technically a parasite of army ants, but studies show that it may actually improve the life of its hosts. When it finds an ant, it will chew off one of the insect’s feet, and begin sucking its haemolymph (blood, basically).

That doesn’t sound very life-improving, does it? Well, Macrocheles latches on in place of the foot, and itself becomes a fully functioning foot. And research has suggested that the performance of the leg is improved with a mite-foot. So, this “parasite” is essentially a living, breathing prosthesis for ants.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bb3f96b0c24acc1ff079e5899ba1702d-lq)

Last, but certainly not least, we come to another catchy name - Osperalycus tenerphagus. You might expect that a creature as bizarre and wacky as this would be discovered in a remote jungle, but it was found on the grounds of Ohio State University, in 2014. The first thing you’d notice about it is its long, serpentine form - it’s built more like a worm than an arachnid.

Things get really weird, however, when you look closer. Its body is covered in rings, which in turn are marked by tiny paddle-like structures. Using muscle under its skin, it contracts these rings, then expands them using hydraulic pressure. This rhythm of contraction and expansion allows them to glide through sand and soil.

There are plenty of locomotive strategies animals use to get around, but this has to be one of the most alien.

So, these microscopic mites probably aren’t the most glamorous or charismatic animals I’ve ever written about, but I hope you too can see the novelty and curious beauty in the small and strange.

From super-speed and prenatal procreation to ant-amputating and a pintsize Shai-Hulud, there’s plenty of fascinating adaptations these crawlies have to offer. Thank you very much for reading! Have a great day.

## A Mussel And Its Maw
    
**Upvotes**: 826 | **Comments**: 45 | **Date**: [Updated Aug 23](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-interesting-bivalves/answer/Gary-Meaney)

You’ve probably eaten more than a few bivalves in your lifetime - clams, mussels, oysters, scallops and the like - but I doubt you know just how diverse these animals are. The bivalve class - represented by aquatic, filter-feeding molluscs with hinged shells - contains over 9,200 known species, found in practically every marine environment, and even plenty of freshwater ecosystems.

Below are my picks for the most unusual, noteworthy, obscure, underrated and interesting species among the bivalves.

* * *

Scallops, i.e. the family Pectinidae. They are by no means obscure or little-known, but they’re one of those animals that everyone knows of, but few people really know.

Did you know, for example, that they can have up to 200 eyes (pictured)? Or that these eyes have a unique mirror-like structure, made of crystal, which has never evolved in any other organism? Or that they can swim backwards at very high speed using water jet propulsion? Scallops are really cool.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ad2d79d0d139e3bcf7bf726fc5f16d4a-lq)

Kuphus polythalamius. This may well be one of the weirdest animals I’ve ever written about, and that’s saying something. You’d never know it was a clam, with its 1.5 meter-long worm-like body encased in a tusk-shaped calcium casing known as a crypt.

Strangest of all, though: it eats mud and rock. Literally. The Kuphus’ gills are stuffed with chemotrophic bacteria, which feed on the hydrogen sulfide in the debris it consumes. The mollusc then derives energy from their metabolic waste products . And it can weigh up to 200 kg! Just unbelievably bizarre.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c6b401628bdcbf8cf4ca9cfa98a08980-lq)

Lioconcha hieroglyphica. This marine clam of the Pacific Ocean is famous for its beautiful markings. They form spiralling rows on its white shell, and are wonderfully reminiscent of some kind of ancient language, like Norse runes, cuneiform script, Ogham or hieroglyphics (hence the name).

Though they may seem random, these symbols actually follow precise mathematical patterns known as cellular automata. This is another cool example of known mathematics showing up in nature.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4f6ecf69bd2508f4f848316388b8c9dc-lq)

The geoduck. You may be familiar with this one, as it’s quite common on the coast of the Pacific Northwest, and is considered a delicacy in several East Asian countries. Note that the “geo” is pronounced as “gooey” - the word comes from an indigenous language.

Their standout feature is a thick, slimy siphon emerging from their shell, which can be well over a metre in length, and is used to suck up plankton. It’s one of the longest-lived animals, with a lifespan of up to 168 years.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f1f552b21b807cf50a75137581f65e19-lq)

The snuffbox mussel. It’s part of the unionids, a fascinating group of freshwater mussels which we’ll be seeing more of shortly. The way it reproduces is pretty damn hardcore - the female will lie with her shell fully opened, until a fish comes along and investigates.

Then, she snaps shut, clamping the fish’ head in rows of razor-sharp serrations, and spews her larvae into its gills. The larvae, called glochidia, spend the first part of their life feeding on the fish.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-56f3b5121849230b8c2fdcc76d3653f9-pjlq)

File shells. File shells are able to swim in short bursts using the same mechanism that scallops do, by expelling seawater at high speed using its two valves. However, these guys take it to the next level with their long, orange tentacles.

The tentacles can wave rhythmically and thus function as oars, propelling the file shells along even faster. They can also be detached at will to distract predators, like the tail of a lizard. When shed, the tentacles begin to emit a noxious chemical, which is even more off-putting for the would-be predator.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1ddd54db795b151a4b4eeac9c916aff0-lq)

The orange-nacre mucket. As another unionid, it’s a close relative of the vicious snuffbox mussel we’ve already met. The species in this family all reproduce the same way; by ejecting parasitic larvae called glochidia in the gills of passing fish.

While the snuffbox uses a violent approach, the orange-nacre mucket is more of a trickster. It has fleshy appendages fringing its shell which mimic a little minnow, so that when a predator like a carp comes along and tries to vacuum up the faux fish, it sucks up the mucket’s glochidia.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2436775309569f0ca9fa7d6b602abffe-pjlq)

The giant clam. Chances are you’ve seen this one before, so it’s not the most obscure species on this list, but it’s the largest bivalve on Earth so it’d be silly not to include it. The heaviest known specimen was found off the coast of Japan, and weighed an estimated 340 kilograms!

Giant clams can grow to such size even in nutrient-poor coral reefs thanks to their symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae, which give them extra nutrition. Each clam contains a dense and complex circulation system on which the algae, known as zooxanthellae, grows. It supplies them with nitrates and phosphates, they supply it with food (their metabolic waste).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a0ba6d6db8ede7f022c8234d85a0c0ec-lq)

The piddocks. These marine clams may be the most boring creatures ever featured in my answers; boring in that they literally bore. Using ridges of serrated teeth on their shells, they ever-so-slowly burrow into solid rock and live in there for the rest of their lives, sticking a siphon out of the hole to feed.

You may have even seen their burrows in person, if you’ve gone to the beach - those pockmarked holes you see in rocks. The tunnels are often appropriated by sea anemones after the clam dies. Also, you’d never think it, but piddocks are the closest relatives of shipworms like the aforementioned Kuphus.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8f2c90866af2f9b292a3386cfc62765d-lq)

The fan mussel. This most marvellous marine Mediterranean mollusc is a real big boy, as it can measure over 1.2 metres in length. It’s no wonder it’s so large, as it grows at a breakneck pace of 20 cm annually. To fasten its hefty frame to the seabed, it uses fibrous strands of keratin called byssus, which can be made into a prized and rare material called sea silk.

Another fascinating thing about the fan mussel is that it hosts a symbiotic species of shrimp within its shell! This gives the shrimp shelter, and in return the shrimp alerts the mussel to danger by snapping its claws. Sadly, it is critically endangered.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6d638ee003b4c63ecdc9696c504abad9-lq)

The Dinaric cave clam. Its name tells you a lot about why it’s so interesting and cool, as it is indeed one of the very, very few bivalves which live exclusively in caves. Specifically it is found in the submersed limestone caverns beneath the Dinaric Alps of southeastern Europe.

Its adaptations to subterranean life are many. The clam has lost all pigmentation, and the ability to move, as it has to spend the scant calories it gets in the cave solely on basic organ functions. It’s tough, too, as it can seemingly live well over 60 years and survive out of water for months on end.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cfd4df38153b1652224d5fec5fc12021-lq)

The thick-shelled river mussel. Like the snuffbox mussel and the orange-nacred mucket, this is a unionid - our third and final species in this family. And, like those two species, it has a very interesting way of transferring its parasitic larvae (glochidia) into fish.

This mussel will affix itself to the shallows near the bank of a river and spout a stream of water towards the opposite bank, like a fountain. For a long time, the reason behind this was a mystery, but it has fairly recently been discovered that they use the water spout to launch their glochidia into the river!

(I couldn’t find any good photos of this behaviour, unfortunately)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b8813e5a794a2862824640d6d6712ed5-lq)

The cuspidariids. I would describe these as being to clams what Venus flytraps are to regular plants. They tend to inhabit very nutrient-poor environments, where there isn’t enough phytoplankton to get by. Instead, they resorted to a more high-calorie food source - animals.

Yes, cuspidariids (and their close relatives the poromyids) are among the only predatory bivalves! And they do that without even moving - rather, they bury themselves in the seabed, concealed except for sensory tentacles and a huge siphon, which vacuums up passing crustaceans.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-da4a02b3f16c3bc20b860eecd9ba214b)

The spiny oysters. Despite their name, they are not oysters, but are in fact close cousins of the scallops. Like their relatives, they have numerous bead-like eyes lining the fringes of their shell.

The namesake feature of the spiny oysters is of course their array of long calcium spikes, which protect them from predators. Their unique shells have been used since the Stone Age to make ornaments, jewellery, and even mortar, in several far-flung cultures of the world.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-397f19bf1a56be7db968e545c753c19d-lq)

Last but not least, Gaimardia trapesina. This clam is commonly found affixed to floating clusters of kelp all across the sub-Antarctic region. They do not eat this kelp, however - no, they use it as a solution to the problem most bivalves face; how do you let your young colonize new territory if you can’t move?

Most clams respond to this by casting out their sperm and eggs so the offspring are born externally - the downside of this is that the babies are very under-developed. Because G. trapesina hitches a ride on moving kelp “rafts”, it can bring its young to pastures new, while also letting them gestate internally and be fully developed at the time of birth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7ad11283dbee50b6be64b283a82c966b-pjlq)

I doubt you thought you’d end up reading about fifteen different practically brainless molluscs today, but here we are. We’ve seen everything from undersea sarlaacs, rock-eating worms, and rock-boring clams to cave-dwelling relics, fountains of larvae and minnow mimicry.

If you’ve made it this far, I hope you found at least some of these interesting - thank you very, very much for reading, and have a great day.

## Bisexual Squids and Their Bizarre Brethren
    
**Upvotes**: 763 | **Comments**: 10 | **Date**: [Updated 1y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-strangest-species-of-squid/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Perhaps the vampire squid would have to take that crown, but he gets a lot of press, so today I’ll instead write about several almost as fascinating runners up. Here goes.

*   Cocked-eyed squids. There are numerous species in this genus, and they are all distinguished by amazingly bizarre eyes. The right eye is quite typical for a squid, however, the left eye is twice as large, yellow-green, shaped like a tube, and is angled directly upward. The right eye scans for the bioluminescence of prey, while the other detects predators overhead.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fbc19c7b73037408136204e8b96bd1f1-lq)

*   Glass squids. The species in this family seem to have the most random hodgepodge of characteristics you could imagine. Most species are transparent, some are bioluminescent. Their tentacles have hooks on them. They can retract their heads into their bodies like turtles. And, if that wasn’t enough, one species - the colossal squid - is the largest invertebrate on the planet, weighing nearly half a metric tonne.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e404501b39517dd08cfbf5a0737e8f4d-lq)

*   Octopoteuthis deletron. This species has no common name, but it’s pretty damn fascinating. First of all, there’s its defense strategy: in the event of a predator attacking, the squid will adhere one of its arms onto said predator and propel itself away, leaving the tentacle behind. Additionally, since you can’t really determine the sex of something in the deep sea, males will mate with all individuals of the same species they find - just in case.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b2cf43aa70604fda28e25e601e7e5c81-pjlq)

*   Bigfin squids. These squids are shrouded in mystery; we haven’t even found an adult specimen yet. They have incredibly large fins, but their tentacles are weirdest of all. They are all identical (something seen in no other squid), they are held in an “elbowed” position, and they’re around 20 times longer than the body. It’s speculated that these ghostly creatures drag their tentacles along the seafloor to catch their food.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ca57f585bde6791ac19b5a9a133028fa-pjlq)

There are a lot more weird and alien squids than just the vampire. Squids are a diverse bunch - not only do they contain these oddities, but the largest, fastest-swimming, and some of the most intelligent invertebrates on the planet. Maybe in a future answer I’ll write about some of the weird prehistoric squids we know of…

## How a Lobster Larva Gets Around
    
**Upvotes**: 692 | **Comments**: 26 | **Date**: [Sep-03](https://www.quora.com/Aside-from-human-beings-do-any-land-animals-ride-other-animals-for-transportation/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Yes, this is surprisingly common in nature! Here are some of my favourite examples.

First of all, leafcutter ants. Chances are you've heard of them; they harvest blades of grass and leaves, carry them back to the nest in an orderly line, and feed them to underground colonies of fungus, which in turn produce little nutritious blobs (called gongylidia… I love that name) exclusively for the ants.

This symbiosis in itself is very interesting, but another unique thing about leafcutter ants is their polymorphism. The worker ants are divided into four separate castes; in ascending order of size, they are termed minims, minors, mediae and majors. The mediae are the ones who cut and carry the leaves, but you often also see little minims “hitchhiking" on the plant matter.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b7d8770e9af7acbb65aff00fa55a2efb-pjlq)

These hitchhikers house bacteria which secrete antimicrobial chemicals, preventing microbes which would be harmful to the fungus crop from contaminating the leaves. They also defend the carrier below, warding off phorid flies which might attack it. While this behaviour isn't strictly for transportation, I still think it's worth mentioning as it is fascinating.

Another insect which hitchhikes is the helmet cockroach, Helmablatta louisrothi. Termites aside, this species may well be the most bizarre cockroach in the world, and that's really saying something. It dwells in the volcanic caves of Vietnam, and it's instantly recognizable thanks to its helmet, which resembles a halo.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f8acd43d83cb4042c1ce664b75c643b9-pjlq)

There is a lot I could write about this wacky little guy, like how it grazes on underground fungi, or how it lures potential mates with a scented secretion, how it has the proportionally largest head of any cockroach, how it's flightless but still has wings, or how the males have claws on their back used to hold the female in place during mating.

However, for our purposes, I brought up the helmet cockroach because - being flightless - it will instead hitch a ride on a bat when it wants to travel! Now that's what I call a Batmobile! t even has a special hook on its dorsal side which it seemingly uses to affix itself to the bat's fur.

Now, we go from under the ground to under the sea with slipper lobster larvae.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5e61d59afbcef4d7f829d3e74dbd40a3-pjlq)

Before reaching adulthood, slipper lobsters go through an underdeveloped phase during which they are termed phyllosoma larvae. They are transparent, tiny, and have long spindly legs. All things considered, they’re not the best adapted to swimming long distances.

But they don’t need to, because they invest in personal transportation - unwilling jellyfish. They hop onto the bell of a passing jellyfish, and ride it as it drifts through the depths, sometimes eventually killing it due to the added weight. And if that wasn’t convenient enough, they also begin to chew away at their host, fueling their growth! Unfortunately, the larvae do not have ice cream to accompany their jelly.

I should also mention that when they do grow up, slipper lobsters are still really, really weird…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fb08a2ffa6000bc2c7d14292c053edaf-lq)

If that doesn’t look like an alien creature I don’t know what does. You see those broad flaps sticking out of the front of the head? Those are actually its antennae, which have evolved into an unrecognizable form.

Moving on, we have another crustacean, and another outlandish oddball: Phronima. It’s a genus of amphipod, which - as you would expect from a freaky sea beast - lives in very deep waters. There are ten different species.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-831a2200e917f54e0aa24dc2d7fc4bca-lq)

That massive “crest” at the back of its head, which makes it look awfully similar to a Xenomorph, is in fact a massive extra pair of translucent, tube-shaped eyes! And that’s not even the strangest part about Phronima. The hazy blob encasing it is a creature called a salp, which is essentially just an aimlessly-floating, barrel-shaped sack of transparent flesh.

The Phronima pictured above is not using the salp for its own transport, but rather for transporting its young. It has torn out the gelatinous viscera of the poor salp, and will lay its eggs in the resulting hollow, before propelling it away so its offspring can hatch elsewhere, in fresh territory.

Next, let’s take a drastic turn away from this series of nightmarish arthropods and move to something cute and fluffy. Let’s talk about Virginia opossums.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-66482ac16c8722e7489a3a48150ccd3c-lq)

Being marsupials, and in fact the only marsupial species native to North America, baby opossums are born in their mother’s pouch. They spend the first part of their life here as blind, fleshy jelly beans, as marsupial young do not spend as much time developing inside the mother as placental mammal babies.

However, when they grow older, the little opossums often like to ride atop mom’s back while she forages. Up to twenty can fit on one mother! In a similar vein, I should briefly touch on shrews.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-15aa3869f68bd6e711613809657b33fb-lq)

They don’t really ride each other, but baby shrews do travel in conga lines of up to eight, with the mother at the front, and each child carrying the tail of the shrew ahead in its mouth. Hang on a minute, isn’t there a movie about this? Anyway…

That’s enough adorable furriness for one answer, we have to circle back to marine invertebrate Lovecraftian horrors. As such, I will continue this tangent by introducing Synophalos. Just like the shrews, this extinct, 515 million year old arthropod travelled in connected chains.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d01240b60d50f23c29fbbf2ae5611ed9-pjlq)

Because this species is so damn ancient, and its body plan is dramatically different from that of any modern arthropod, we know very little about Synophalos and its place on the evolutionary tree of life. However, like so much of the Cambrian fauna, we know it was really cool and extremely weird.

* * *

That’s all from me, guys, I hope you enjoyed this answer. Thank you all very much for reading, have a good day.

## The World's Fastest Animal - Not What You Think
    
**Upvotes**: 591 | **Comments**: 17 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-animal-faster-than-a-cheetah/answer/Gary-Meaney)

As animals go, the cheetah is pretty slow - that is, if we’re talking about things relative to body size. While mathematically, bigger animals will be faster, I think that this measurement is the one which gives animals the admiration they merit.

So, what is the fastest animal relative to its size? As said, it’s not the cheetah, and it’s not the peregrine falcon or golden eagle either. It is in fact the humble South California mite.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9def18ce4657f842b153980895c618e5-lq)

This obscure creature, also known as Paratarsotomus macropalpis, is able to run 332 of its body length in a single second, as opposed to a cheetah’s meager 16. If you were able to be this fast for your size, you could run at speeds of 2,092 kilometres per hour! The figures are staggering.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9bdaf3d2d1b818afecc8f18d448c14a6-lq)

Unfortunately, this mite is only a fraction of a centimetre long, so the sight of it racing along isn’t all that spectacular.

Anyway, not only is this mite able to move with incredible speed, it can do so in extreme conditions. South California mites were observed running at top velocity - which of course produces a lot of heat - on 60° C concrete! Furthermore, they’re agile too, and can stop or turn in an instant.

It’s really quite surprising that this animal is so little known.

## The Butterflies That Flap Under the Sea
    
**Upvotes**: 374 | **Comments**: 14 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-unique-winged-creatures/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Depending on your idea of what is and isn’t a wing, I have a candidate which might well qualify. I’m talking about the pteropods, a group of sea snails and sea slugs which swim using “wings”. There are two main groups of pteropods - those with shells, and those without.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9447510db2e57b32f50d9ba49ff30f76-lq)

Pteropods with shells are known as sea butterflies, or thecosomes. There are nine known families of sea butterflies, with many species distributed across the world’s oceans. What was once the foot has evolved into a pair of wing-shaped lobes, which are used to swim through the water in slow, flapping motions.

Because of their unique method of locomotion, sea butterflies spend their whole lives upside down. Most are less than a centimetre in length, and live as plankton. “Flying” is tough work when compared to the slow lugging that most snails do, so to cut down on weight, most thecosome shells are so thin that they’re transparent, which makes them hard to detect.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-144829008c23a49f7fd8b27e788600c8-lq)

Sea butterflies also have a very interesting method of feeding. They are herbivores, feeding on microscopic phytoplankton much smaller even than themselves. To catch their food, they use a strategy known as mucous-meshing - essentially, they secrete an expanse of mucus, up to 5 centimetres across, which acts as a “net” to snag passing plankton.

Mucous-meshing is also used by other groups, such as pyrosomes (sea squirts which form elongated, translucent colonies and float about the deep). Anyway, that’s been the sea butterflies, now for the second group of pteropods.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0f569c8bf7da6e8ea2d2801dfddd87c0-lq)

The shelless pteropods, however, belong to a different group - the sea angels, or gymnosomes. Like their snail cousins, their foot has become a pair of wings used for locomotion. In addition to lacking a shell, they are generally larger than sea butterflies - the largest species, pictured above, measures 5 centimetres in length. This is because it lives in cold polar waters.

Sea angels can be twice as fast as thecosomes, and indeed many species feed exclusively on sea butterflies. Some of them, such as the one pictured below, have a ring of squid-like tentacles around their mouth, used to grab their victims. They even have suckers on the inner side.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-00db67f9a24ba06510489109f7daf2f7)

The last species I’ll mention is Clione antarctica, found in the Southern Ocean. This sea angel is also a predator of sea butterflies, although it can go for months without food due to a large reserve of lipids it stores in its body. However, what’s most interesting about this species, I find, is its chemical defense.

It manufactures a unique compound called pteroenone, which deters predatory fish. There is then a species of amphipod - Hyperiella dilatata \- which “kidnaps” C. antarctica and carries them around for protection. The crustacean with its gelatinous bodyguard is shown below.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-37a8db52e64bb02853201efa12c21fde-lq)

So, that’s pretty much everything you need to know about the tiny, delicate sea butterflies, and the diverse, predatory sea angels. What first strikes one about them is their wings, but when you look closer there are so many other fascinating details about them to find out.

## Don't Judge a Bug By its Cover
    
**Upvotes**: 369 | **Comments**: 16 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-scariest-but-least-aggressive-animal/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Solifuges

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-56e9214f62163b47626ce3afd278b30a-lq)

Also known as camel spiders, solifuges are arachnids, not quite spiders though, which can grow to over six inches in diameter. In addition to this, they have enormous chelicerae and are covered in long hair. Also, they can run at an impressive 16 km/h. In other words, they’re pretty damn scary.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-21624bb14498c79769feb0db3652ba85-lq)

There are many, many myths about solifuges. Roman manuscripts erroneously cited them as responsible for the evacuation of an entire African nation. Urban legends seriously exaggerate their size, speed, ferociousness and dangerousness. One family in Essex evacuated their home when they found a solifuge in it, and claimed it killed their dog.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fe2c5ebd02d4902e43964fa68f3d1f71-lq)

However, none of that is true. Solifuges are more or less harmless; there are a few recorded cases of people getting mild nips, but they are entirely non-venomous. The myths surrounding their venomousness arose when a paper stated that solifuge “venom” was fatal to a test mouse.

However, since there is no way the solifuge could administer the venom and the substance was injected into the mouse, it’s established that this is just a non-venom substances which is lethal in the bloodstream (many animals’ blood and saliva are).

## The Living Matryoshka Doll
    
**Upvotes**: 253 | **Comments**: 10 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-animals-have-the-weirdest-pregnancies/answer/Gary-Meaney)

There are a lot of great answers to this question already, but I know a creature which should make a great addition to the list. I’m talking about Gyrodactylus \- the living matryoshka doll.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e1de18f5713bbd0787eeedc86e630dbb-lq)

Gyrodactylus is a genus of flatworm. There are many species within this genus, but all live in the oceans and are parasites of fish. On the outside, they don’t look like much, but Gyrodactylus worms are one of the weirdest animals I know of.

They’re viviparous - that is, they give birth to live young like we do, rather than laying eggs - which is fairly interesting as it is. However, Gyrodactylus exhibit an extremely rare form of viviparity known as hyperviviparity. Here’s how it works.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1882d4e27be53e7ed76fe6a6a56b9108-pjlq)

Via asexual reproduction, the flatworm produces a female embryo. But instead of leaving the “womb”, the daughter stays there and generates a second embryo - all in utero. The result is a Gyrodactylus inside a Gyrodactylus inside a Gyrodactylus.

In fact, I recall reading in one paper that sometimes there can be up to 5 nested generations in a Gyrodactylus flatworm! These creatures really are like living Russian dolls. Imagine being pregnant and carrying your great great granddaughter in your belly.

One of the most fascinating spiders in the world (and that’s saying something) is Darwin’s bark spider, which lives in the humid forests of eastern Madagascar. It wasn’t discovered by Charles Darwin (in fact, it was only found in 2009), but was described on the 150th anniversary of the publication of Origin, hence the name.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0c9884b9bee1719109c5ba5ddd7c438a-lq)

The species is most well-known for the amazing webs it builds. They are the largest orb webs in the world, with total surface areas of up to 2.8 square metres, and span entire rivers, some up to 25 metres wide. Their exceptional size allows them to catch dozens of river insects at a time, especially mayflies.

These giant webs are made of no ordinary material. The silk of a Darwin’s bark spider is the toughest biological material known to man, by a factor of two. It can have a tensile toughness of up to 520 Joules per cubic metre, making it ten times stronger than Kevlar (by area).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2de65e02b7e73e07dc19da6b6ed83a96-lq)

But we’re not here to talk about the web of this spider. Equally bizarre and fascinating is its mating habits. They feature many behaviours associated, on their own, with other species of spider, but is the only species with a repertoire of so many. Darwin’s bark spider mating goes something like this:

*   The male approaches a female, which will be at least three times his size. She could well eat him once she’s had enough, so males usually prefer females which have just molted. Their exoskeleton will still be soft and leathery, so they won’t be as agile. This way, the male is more likely to survive the encounter.
*   The male ties the female up in his silk. (I know what you’re thinking… stop thinking it.) This is a further countermeasure to decrease his chances of being devoured. In such a small quantity, however, the silk is more of a hindrance to the female spider than a fail-safe straitjacket. His survival is not yet assured.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-104d71feb9f5244360d76e72156fd363-lq)

*   In yet another preventative measure, occasionally the male will… well, salivate on the female’s epigyne - her reproductive parts. Using his palps (a pair of fang-like organs near the mouth), he secretes salival fluid onto her epigyne, lubricating it. Jokes aside, this seems to have a calming effect on the female, making her less aggressive.
*   Copulation occurs, with sperm transferred via the palps. But, in about half of observed cases, the palps will then break off and remain inside the female. The purpose of this? The severed reproductive organs now plug the female’s epigyne, preventing the male’s competitors from passing on their genes.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-46d3f5f3e3f18dce03b881c1d452cdf2-lq)

*   After mating, the male does something quite surprising. If his palps have not already detached in the female, he chews them off himself! By self-castrating, he causes a hormonal change which makes him much more aggressive. Now, he is better equipped to fight off rival males and protect his bloodline.

As you can see, the Darwin’s bark spider has a damn weird sex life. Some of you might have read my last answer - [Gary Meaney's answer to Which one is the coolest or most interesting island of the world, and why?](https://www.quora.com/Which-one-is-the-coolest-or-most-interesting-island-of-the-world-and-why/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") - where I had a short dossier on the species. I mainly focused on the web and silk there, saying that the mating habits were “a story for another day”. That day is today.

## Whale-Sized Worms and Ginormous Jellies
    
**Upvotes**: 129 | **Comments**: 3 | **Date**: [3y](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-longest-animal-of-the-world/answer/Gary-Meaney)

The bootlace worm, Lineus longissimus, is quite possibly the longest animal in the world. These are a type of aquatic Nemertean, or ribbon worm, which have been recorded at lengths about 60 metres, twice as long as an average blue whale. Here it is:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-09309a0f3826db5d7a3b14c4f4bf96cc-lq)

It’s hard to appreciate its length when it’s all bundled up like that, but I assure you; they’re enormous. Their width however, is significantly less impressive, usually only a few millimetres.

So, as I said, this guy’s a Nemertean, belonging to a phylum of invertebrates most closely related to Lophophorates, and more distantly so to molluscs and segmented worms, or annelids. Nemerteans are characterized by a horrible, slimy proboscis, which can be everted through the oral sphincter.

However, it’s not technically definite that this organism is the longest animal, since Nemerteans are known to be highly variable in terms of elasticity, and can expand their bodies quite dramatically. We do not yet know if bootlace worms can grow to 60 metres in their natural state. The next competitor is the lion’s mane jellyfish, Cyanea capillata.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fccacedbd9e4c10dee41324cd9892840-lq)

These have been observed being as long as 37 metres, and are quite huge in other dimensions too. They have a diameter of about 2 metres, more than most people’s height, and up to 1,200 tentacles (I don’t know who the hell gets paid for counting these things). The length isn’t as readily observable as you might think, as the longest tentacles are exceedingly thin and hard to see.

The blue whale, contrary to what another answerer has purported, is neither longest nor second longest, but resides in third place, shortly behind the jellyfish.

# PLANTS and FUNGI

## The Slime that Told the Time

I was going to say hyenas, but that’s taken, so allow me to present you an altogether more different and alien organism. Technically, it’s not an animal, but I doubt you’ll mind.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b69bee4f8140b73a03ac0863a62c9c59-lq)

Pictured above is Physarum polycephalum, also known as the “many-headed slime”, a type of protist, and, specifically, a slime mold. The term “slime mold” doesn’t refer to a specific single group, but it is a broad term for several kinds of eukaryote which behave similarly.

Anyway, Physarum has - astonishingly - a basic form of intelligence, despite having no brain and only comprising a single many-nucleic cell. Here are some of the amazing things this slime can do.

*   It can solve mazes. A P. polycephalum placed in a plastic maze will extend forth hundreds of tendrils, exploring all possible paths until it finds one which leads to food. It then retracts all the tendrils leading to dead ends. Moreover, it knows which way is quickest. If there are multiple routes to the reward, it’ll retract the (even slightly) longer one.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-070a8b370df777bec11211233923506d-lq)

*   It remembers. When the mold is solving a maze, it leaves behind a trail of slime wherever its tendrils reach. Using this slime, the Physarum avoids the paths it has already taken. This is essentially a creative, albeit rudimentary, analogue to memory - one that is in external, material form.
*   It mimics transport networks. A P. polycephalum was placed in a plastic enclosure the shape of Tokyo, Japan. Bits of food were placed where the major transport hubs would be in real Tokyo, and the slime mold - knowing which ways were fastest, created a replica of the city’s rail networks using its tendrils.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f44a2c184f6d2190e858655acfa1d928.webp)

*   It learns and keeps track of time. A team of scientists - including the one who did the maze experiment, put this slime mold into a long groove, letting it move along the groove. However, every 30 minutes - they decreased the temperature and the humidity (slime molds thrive in hot, moist conditions). The mold slowed its pace to use less energy. After a while, the scientists stopped. Sure enough, the polycephalum kept slowing every 30 minutes, showing it could both learn and keep time.
*   It’s a healthy eater. Another experiment had the slime molds in the middle of a circular clock face. At each mark in the clock, a different food was placed. However, some of them were made up of the healthiest ratio of carbs to protein, while others weren’t. All of the slimes selected the optimal foods.

An astonishing organism if there ever was one. So unusual that this creature is so obscure, for it certainly has some amazing stories to tell.

## The Curse of the Bamboo Flower
    
**Upvotes**: 3,917 | **Comments**: 47 | **Date**: [1y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-little-known-connections-between-historical-events-that-seem-to-have-nothing-to-do-with-each-other/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Roughly every 50 years, Melocanna baccifera flowers. It is a species of bamboo, distributed across India and Southeast Asia, and can grow to be up to 25 metres tall. This cyclical event is known as mautam in some northeast Indian states.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-58d96fad97916f83c489164a170a7807-lq)

The first record we have of mautam is from the year 1862, in the Mizoram state of India. Directly after the flowering, the region experienced an infestation of black rats and, subsequently, fell into famine. Fast forward to the next mautam, in 1911, another plague of rats. 1958, the same thing.

In fact, this phenomenon - bamboo flowering and then a huge spike in rat numbers - has been seen all over the world, not only in India but also in China, Myanmar, Laos, Japan, Madagascar and South America. This can’t be coincidental.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b667b1b9b572563e80bce77519207160-lq)

So what is happening? As it turns out, when M. baccifera and other bamboo species flower, they release countless seeds, which in turn fuel a population explosion in the local black rats. Once the seeds have all been eaten, the rodents turn to nearby villages to look for food, in what is known as a “rat flood”.

Nowadays, this has long since been realized, and now the Indian government prepares for mautam before the flood hits. The last one was in 2006, and villagers were educated about pest control and encouraged to grow crops whose scents would ward off rats.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5a4ac226e7603c67c961efebdff20a9a-lq)

The next famine is expected to hit Mizoram in the mid-2050s, and the local Mizos know it. It must be strange to live in the knowledge that such an event is impending. It's also pretty amazing that the reproductive cycle of a plant has such a major effect on the lives of so many.

## The Blood-Red Beach of China
    
**Upvotes**: 1,384 | **Comments**: 23 | **Date**: [Oct-02](https://www.quora.com/What-place-on-Earth-has-the-most-beautiful-vegetation/answer/Gary-Meaney)

In northeastern China, a great watercourse called the Liao River winds its way into the shallow Bohai Sea. As it approaches the coast, the surrounding terrain flattens out, and it spreads out to form a vast tidal wetland. One corner of this marsh has become famous for its stunning flora: Red Beach.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c86f3e0413ab7c10d888ef724543c6c0-lq)

The deposited soil in Red Beach (known as 红海滩 in China) is very alkaline, and the land is flooded with salty seawater, making it a hostile environment for conventional plant life. One hardy species, however, has found it to be the perfect place to thrive: Suaeda salsa.

This amaranth is well-adapted to the harsh conditions, and is the dominant form of vegetation in the wetland. When autumn comes round, and the salinity of the water increases, the Suaeda starts producing protective pigments called betacyanins. They are the same molecules that give beetroots their colour, and turn the whole landscape from green to red.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dee41ed095dcd5aafcf39cec3205b779-lq)

This beautiful seasonal change of hue attracts many tourists each year. Visitors can view the marshes from elevated wooden boardwalks which zig-zag over the water.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1e4ef5ed37d8a65611666f60e098acb6-lq)

Thankfully, tourism here likely doesn’t have severe impact on the natural ecosystem, due to the upraised nature of the walkways. Red Beach is home to plenty of biodiversity, even including rare spotted seals! Also, like most large wetlands, it’s a haven for birds.

Gulls, swans, ducks, geese, herons and egrets all roam the area. The most iconic Red Beach bird of all is the red-crowned crane, one of the most endangered cranes on Earth. It migrates to the Liao River Delta in the summer to breed, while it’s not too cold, before flying back south to spend the winter.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-664841760f60dadbe5cfecd217be1642-pjlq)

So, does this wetland have more beautiful vegetation than any other locale in the world? I think it’s a strong candidate. One thing’s for sure, though: there aren’t many places on this planet which look like the inside of a red velvet cake.

Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed, have a great day!

## Africa's Mountains of Mega-Flora
    
**Upvotes**: 1,381 | **Comments**: 41 | **Date**: [1y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-underrated-mountain-ranges/answer/Gary-Meaney)

On the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda is Africa’s highest mountain range - the Rwenzori Mountains. While Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya stand taller, they are freestanding volcanoes not part of any range.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0a2ddb474e2ab53480fe732fb643b112-lq)

The highest peak in the range - Mount Stanley - is 5,109 metres above sea level, and covered in snow year-round. The Rwenzori Mountains are one of the only places in Africa where you can see glaciers, although many of these have shrunk at an alarming rate in the last century.

The Rwenzori Mountains are part of a larger area of mountainous terrain known as the Albertine Rift. This is the western arm of the Great Rift Valley, and contains more endemic species than almost anywhere in East Africa. Speaking of species, let’s look at the wildlife.

In the mountain range, you can see some bizarre, larger-than-life plants, such as the giant groundsel:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a4a5417a4124179411bf43793fce07af-lq)

The giant lobelia:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-655e14206288b514c113d353b1600932-lq)

And the giant heather. This 6 metre tall tree is the largest species of heather in the world, and forms forests which are usually festooned with heavy clumps of moss.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eae704a121826af4d6eabf7537fb0dbf-lq)

Amongst the strange plants live many large mammals, such as African forest elephants, chimpanzees, hyraxes, duiker antelope and several species of monkey. Due to the isolation created by the mountains, there are many animal species found only in the Albertine Rift. You can find 19 of the birds - and 4 of the mammals - endemic to the Albertine Rift in the Rwenzori Mountains .

The endemic fauna includes the Rwenzori turaco:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0faf90d87301f2e4a77d3eb1d6f24fbb-lq)

And the strange weaver:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-508964aee0b2ac2d462088110ad9a149-lq)

And, to top it all off, the scenery is simply breathtaking. A picture speaks a thousand words, so I’m going to leave the photos to do the talking:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-54e8f20acbdfaf4f45b69b45aace034d-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7ea9a1b84c99a9d4ea25f7760fc3fb0a-lq)

Despite all this, the Rwenzori Mountains receive very little attention from tourists. For the conservation-minded, me among them of course, this is great, because it means that the countless precious endemics are unsullied by human activity.

Nevertheless, you’d wonder why they’re so rarely visited. Of course, travel in the DR Congo is unadvisable, but Uganda - where the eastern flank of the range is located - is a safe and secure country, perfect for tourism.

## The Mystery of the Shape-Shifting Vine
    
**Upvotes**: 1,136 | **Comments**: 40 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-living-beings-can-be-considered-masters-of-mimicry/answer/Gary-Meaney)

In my opinion, the most amazing species of mimic is not an animal at all; it’s a rather boring-looking species of plant called Boquila trifoliolata - nicknamed the “chameleon vine”, and for good reason.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-105dc497d0bce3acd8e3433c6a003e17-pjlq)

Believe it or not, all the above leaves are from the same species of plant. Boquila’s mind-blowing ability is that its leaves change shape to mimic those of the nearest trees. Somehow, their size, shape, stalk and colour morph to blend in with nearby tree leaves, disguising themselves from animals which might eat them.

They can even grow spiny tips on the leaves should the host plant have such spines, and can mimic different types of foliage on the same individual plant. On any one Boquila trifoliolata plant, some leaves might be 10 times the size of others.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a72f1b7b4145eaaef17cc7c1e2914be6-pjlq)

But this of course begs the question - how on Earth does it “know” which leaves to mimic? It can’t be by touch, because it doesn’t even require physical contact to mimic. There are currently two hypotheses:

1.  The vine can detect compounds emanating from the local plants, recognizes them, and then uses hormones and signals to change the genetic makeup of the leaves in the area. Of course, this would mean that it must have an internal “database”, if you will, of dozens of local tree species.
2.  An even wilder idea - the chameleon vine is in fact receiving genes from the nearby trees. Horizontal gene transfer is when organisms pass on DNA, but not via producing offspring - it would be like you taking some random person’s genes and using them to look like him.

I think I’d put my money on the first hypothesis, as it seems more grounded. I fail to imagine how horizontal gene transfer could occur between two plants if they weren’t in contact. In any case, it still remains a mystery to this day.

Boquila trifoliolata is one of my favourite species of plant, and I hope you’ve enjoyed learning about it in this answer. Thanks for reading.

## Why We Need Wildfires
    
**Upvotes**: 706 | **Comments**: 14 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-trees-that-only-seed-themselves-during-forest-fires-or-is-that-a-myth-If-they-do-how-could-they-have-evolved-that-practice/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Yes, such plants are called pyrophiles.

A pyrophile is a type of pyrophyte (fire-tolerant plant) which requires fire in order to complete its cycle of reproduction. Most pyrophiles are grasses, I believe, but there are pyrophilic trees - for example, the coastal redwood Sequoia sempervirens.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8ce7201a1601eb4df8f48478fdd020b1-lq)

First of all, let me explain serotiny. Serotinous plants are ones which rely on an external factor to trigger the release of their seeds; for pyrophiles, that trigger is fire. In other examples of serotiny, it can be flooding or rainfall.

When forest fires occur in sequoia forests, they may appear to be wholly destructive forces, and indeed many trees are burnt to crisps. However, sequoias have fireproof bark which shields them from any infernos.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5e259bf2ae71b17da4f465b734105671.webp)

What the bark also does is channel the heat upwards, towards the sequoias’ cones. The cones’ openings are sealed shut with tree resin, but the flames melt this resin and allow the seeds to be released.

When the seeds fall to the ground, they find a perfect place to grow. There’s plenty of space now that so many trees are burnt up, and that also means there’s little competition. The fire breaks down locked-up nutrients inside the trees and recycles them into the soil, ready to be taken up by the seedlings.

## Walking Trees - Fact or Fiction?
    
**Upvotes**: 613 | **Comments**: 16 | **Date**: [2y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-ideas-or-misconceptions-that-you-learned-in-childhood-that-later-in-adulthood-found-out-were-fundamentally-wrong/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Socratea exorrhiza, the walking tree

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2564715ae7e08ac7a1440a6fb18172ac-lq)

S. exorrhiza is a species of palm tree, found in the tropical forests of South and Central America. It can grow to 25 metres in height, and its most notable feature are its bizarre, stilt-like roots, which hold it above the ground.

The purpose of these strange roots was greatly puzzling for many a 20th century botanist. In 1961, a well-known biologist called E. J. H. Corner hypothesized that they allowed the tree to stay above the water when swampy forest floors flooded. However, no evidence was found to support that hypothesis.

Nearly two decades later, in 1980, the scientist John H. Bodley proposed an altogether more radical idea - the roots enabled the palms to walk.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-44029ba286674d8748dc57a589d2cc4f)

In a way, at least. His idea was that, if a nearby tree fell and knocked the palm over, the Socratea exorrhiza would use its stilt roots to creep away from its initial location and right itself. New roots - still vertical, but perpendicular to the trunk - would grow, and the tree would eventually find itself upright again. The old trunk and roots would rot away, leaving Socratea looking just as it did before - but in a different place.

(Another variation of the hypothesis says that the tree actually tracks moving light from the canopy throughout the year, moving up to a meter annually)

This idea, being so wild, quickly spread, and tour guides often recited it to visitors to the jungles in S. exorrhiza’s range. I remember being told of a walking palm tree as a child, though I obviously didn’t remember its name. In any case, I decided to research it it recently, and found it to be disproven.

Enter Dr. Gerardo Avalos, pictured below with Socratea exorrhiza. He’s perhaps the world’s foremost expert on the tree.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1333b0be4cbd5866ddb176050789567d-pjlq)

His extensive analysis of the species in 2005 yielded no evidence whatsoever for “walking” abilities. While, occasionally, some roots on one side or another would rot away, the roots clearly couldn’t move and the trunk remained in the same position, regardless of lighting.

So, while a cool idea, it proved to be baseless. Unfortunate, but then again, the plant kingdom has done weirder things.

## The World Within a Pitcher Plant
    
**Upvotes**: 285 | **Comments**: 38 | **Date**: [Sun](https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-favorite-carnivorous-plant/answer/Gary-Meaney)

This is a painfully difficult question to answer, as basically all carnivorous plants are fascinating. However, if I had to choose, there’s one group which stands out to me as the most interesting of all, and for that reason, it’s my favourite. The group in question is the genus Nepenthes, otherwise known as the Old World pitcher plants.

I’m sure many of you have heard of pitcher plants - they are living pitfall traps, which drown unsuspecting insects in a pool of digestive fluid. What you may not know is that the name does not refer to a single type of flora; it’s more of an umbrella term applied to a handful of independent groups which have evolved the same basic survival strategy. In Southeast Asia, Nepenthes is the dominant brand of pitcher.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a35f142e7d60015568c371cc4853a4a6-pjlq)

As you can see, the leaves are tubular in shape, with a wide opening and a lid on top. The plants’ glamorous colours and sweet scent of nectar entice flies into landing on the opening’s ribbed lip, which is known as the peristome. However, unbeknownst to the insects, the peristome is coated in a waxy substance, causing them to slip and plunge into the chamber.

The fluid at the bottom can be either watery or jelly-like in consistency. Its composition ensures that it is both viscous and elastic, a ruthless combination that makes escape a near impossibility for the prey. It also contains a cocktail of digestive enzymes for making short work of all victims, and anti-microbial proteins that prevent the liquid from being contaminated with bacteria or fungi.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d302f4630241a9e9e1cf08f731b034a8-lq)

Most of the time, only invertebrates fall prey to Nepenthes plants - flies, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, snails and the like. There are certainly exceptions though - the larger species can even drown frogs, lizards, birds and rats.

There’s also one species, Nepenthes albomarginata, which feeds only on termites. It’s the world’s only carnivorous plant that specializes in a single food source, and also probably the only one which offers up its own flesh as bait. Around the top of each its pitchers is a ring of furry white hairs, or trichomes. Seemingly, termites love to graze on these, but often fall into the pit in so doing.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-48a2ef0c9d08463349154ae37ed0e53b-pjlq)

All that said, the most fascinating thing about the Old World pitcher plants is not how they capture their prey, but their relationships with other, non-prey animals. Each Nepenthes basically contains its own miniature ecosystem, a microcosm of the surrounding rainforest. The shockingly diverse assembly of little critters which inhabit these plants are collectively known as Nepenthes infauna.

The infauna can be further divided into three tiers; nepenthebionts, nepenthephiles and nepenthexenes. The first category, the nepenthebionts, are highly specialized, such that part of their life cycle is entirely dependent on the pitcher plants. Many species of mosquitoes spend their larval stage in Nepenthes fluid - look closely at any pitcher and you might see shoals of worm-like mosquito larvae swimming about.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ae1ae9d37316d81370056bde4abd9500-pjlq)

An even more interesting nepenthebiont is the diving ant, Colobopsis schmitzi. It has a symbiotic relationship with the fanged pitcher plant of Borneo. This plant lacks waxy surfaces, and its fluid is much less potent at digestion. How then does it catch prey? As it turns out, most of the fanged pitcher plant’s diet constitutes the droppings of the ants which inhabit it.

These ants get their name from how they dive into the pitcher’s pool of liquid - they can swim and hold their breath for 30 seconds. Since the fluid is lacking in acid and enzymes, the Nepenthes cannot digest many animals which fall in, and the products of their decomposition can even prove fatal for the plants. The ants, however, are more than up to the task, so they haul fallen flies out and devour them.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2b2144a802bc6c470cca9e990235d5ea-lq)

The host plant, in turn, can easily process the ants’ feces, so it doesn’t lose out. In addition to a stable food source, the pitcher provides diving ants with a home; its tendrils are hollow, with tunnel space for the insects to build a thriving colony.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1b61340af3b405fc959204d31a58e611-pjlq)

The other two categories are the nepenthophiles and nepenthoxenes. The former are not dependent on pitcher plants for survival, but almost invariably live inside them. The latter are the animals who occasionally frequent Nepenthes plants, but only do so opportunistically - usually represented by scuttle flies and hoverflies feeding on the putrefying carrion within the fluid.

The full diversity of Nepenthes infauna is too vast and, unfortunately, too poorly studied to detail in a single answer. There are filter-feeding larvae, tiny crustaceans, swimming predators, predatory spiders, creatures which drink the fluid itself… each pitcher is like a tiny ocean. And the infauna is not limited to teeny weeny life. Meet, for example, Geosesarma malayanum.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-254c0f42933cbca21e1707b8306b0463-lq)

Yes, a crab! Unlike the diving ants, it’s not a symbiont, but rather a parasite of sorts. It makes a living by plundering the pitcher Nepenthes ampullaria, nabbing any drowning critters it comes across. However, it ought to be careful, as sometimes crabs can slip and themselves fall prey to the pitcher!

If you thought that was cool, know that there are even bigger, more unexpected nepenthephiles. Look closely at a Nepenthes lowii and you might notice something unusual about it. The underside of its lid is coated in a kind of beaded white gel. This secretion reportedly has a sugary taste (yes, a naturalist ate it to find out) and for quite some time, its function was a mystery.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-65ab62e3a1051392d54ea118bed9f3f4-lq)

In 2009, the pieces started coming together, and we began to realize that N. lowii was the world’s only vegetarian carnivorous plant. The sugary beads attract tree shrews, which lick them up, and defecate almost immediately. The shrews’ excrement is a nutrient-rich source of food for the pitcher, which serves as a replacement for insects and other animal prey.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-59f14d5f5b38353d85a0e22a8857a6cc-lq)

Other Nepenthes species employ even more extreme means of getting their fix of mammalian droppings. N. hemsleyana of Borneo has an elongated form, of the perfect size and shape to house a Hardwicke’s woolly bat! These bats commonly roost inside the pitchers, where they are safe from parasites and the elements. Of course, they also defecate in them, providing the plant with food.

Likewise, Hardwicke’s woolly bats seem to be adapted for roosting in Nepenthes. The clicking noises they make to echolocate have the highest frequency of any bat - perhaps an adaptation to pinpoint the small and easily-missed plants. The pitchers also have a curved, parabolic structure above their entrances, which reflects sounds well and may further help them be located.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6c11fe2551292cbcc9b3cd7bb7e2d18f-lq)

So, do you now understand why the Old World pitcher plants are my favourite of all the planet’s carnivorous flora? After all, they allow me to write about half a dozen different animals while still writing about one type of plant - a welcome bonus. I hope you all enjoyed this answer and found it interesting. Thanks for reading, and have a great day!

## The Vine That Ate the South
    
**Upvotes**: 228 | **Comments**: 10 | **Date**: [1y](https://www.quora.com/What-are-one-or-two-of-the-biggest-examples-in-history-where-invasive-plants-have-had-a-major-negative-impact-on-specific-biospheres-or-regions-of-the-planet/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Perhaps the most infamous and iconic instance of plant invasion would be that of kudzu \- the “Vine that Ate the South”. Kudzu is a Japanese vine which was introduced to the United States in 1876 for a Japan-themed exposition and subsequently gained rapid abundance throughout the Southern US.

Kudzu’s transformative and destructive capacity is legendary. It is said to smother entire forests and starve the native trees of sunlight. The effect it has on leaf litter reduces the soil’s carbon content by over a quarter.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1e8d14b098626f84d578e125fe0a284b-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-51b0c1923e40d51ad68b7d31804ff448-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-be6fff341393ba08edd8dd6265653e21-lq)

Those are all true facts… that being said, kudzu isn’t the apocalyptic, all-consuming megalomaniac which it’s often construed as. While you’ll often see claims that it shrouds nearly 30,000 square kilometres and expands by 600 square km a year, these figures are likely false, first published by a random gardening magazine.

In truth, there are less than 1,000 square kilometres of kudzu in the USA, in contrast to the much more voracious but obscure Japanese honeysuckle, pictured below, which has conquered some 45,000 square kilometres of America.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6889e3028cebf697363984b946fca565-lq)

So, ultimately, the biggest danger of kudzu to conservation is not the plant itself, but the manner in which it has robbed much more problematic invaders of our attention. It’s far from the only time the media has exaggerated the danger of an invasive species - the recent absurd panic over so-called “murder hornets” being an extreme example.

Perhaps a much more fitting antagonist of the plant world would be the water hyacinth, a floating aquatic flower native to the Amazon rainforest. The facts and figures of this species are much, much more worrying.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1d548dc5c8452db0830e5f1cc6646536-lq)

The water hyacinth is one of the fastest-growing plants on Earth. Via runners, it’s capable of growing up to 5 metres in a single day, forming thick mats which can double their size in a week or two. In fact, over a three-week period, the population of a given hyacinth community can multiply a hundredfold.

The species has found its way to lakes, lagoons, swamps, ponds and reservoirs across all six of the world’s inhabited continents, from Florida to Kenya to New Zealand. When mats of water hyacinth choke waterways, the surface level may rise by as much as a metre, and the organisms beneath the surface are severely deprived of light and oxygen.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-894abcdcf0f83d8ec402e48841dd487e-lq)

Furthermore, they encourage the propagation of certain bugs which carry lethal diseases, such as mosquitoes and aquatic snails.

Thankfully for us, water hyacinth won’t bring an ecological apocalypse to the world. When effectively controlled, it poses little threat, and can even be beneficial to the ecosystem in small doses.

As a bonus fun fact: In 1910, a detailed plan to introduce hippos to the USA as ranch animals to simultaneously curb the spread of the water hyacinth and solve the meat crisis at the time.

# ECOSYSTEM SPOTLIGHT

## The Islands in the Sky

In the northeast of South America, there lies a sprawling geological formation known as the Guiana Shield; an expanse of 1.7 billion year old rock. Long ago, it was a high plateau of sedimentary stone, but most of it has since been eroded away.

What remains of this ancient highland are immense blocks of sandstone, flattened at the top. The local Pemon people call them tepuis, meaning “houses of the gods”, and there are hundreds of them.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-feb9260fc47006cd457409c95355b82d-lq)

Most tepuis are scattered across Venezuela, but they extend into neighbouring Guyana and Brazil too. Outside of the Andes, these tabletop mountains are among the tallest landforms in South America.

You have Mount Roraima, the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-490e20d71b6b3f56c61c80b6c19240c8-lq)

Auyán-tepui, home to the world’s tallest waterfall:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6060843cea632173f71c45e292475c64-lq)

Cerro Autana, a mountain which has a cave cutting right through it, with an opening on either side:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d934aa4328e1f820f579067cfd21c59b-pjlq)

Sarisariñama, the surface of which is stippled with massive sinkholes:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d891e3bac585e148a4009c16af40e483-pjlq)

And many more. Towering high above the forests and savannahs, surrounded by sheer cliffs on all sides, tepuis are just as remote and inaccessible as islands in the sea; they are effectively islands in the sky. And, just like marine islands, they have a unique array of wildlife which evolved in a vacuum, cut off from the “mainland”.

Before I introduce you too the flora and fauna of these mountains, I’ll go over some of their most interesting physical characteristics which make them such unique environments. Most tepuis are surrounded on all sides by abrupt vertical cliff faces.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f819f5f28dbc5efbe57fea3dde023294-lq)

On top, the terrain varies, but you’ll often find these otherworldly rock formations known as stone forests. Here, the elements have eroded the soluble rock into complex pavements of grooves, pillars and furrows.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-14b64bcec141a52b9375ceca91ba55c4-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f7f95f5dc7104cdfc40061f401038284-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5f0afc98cb3eef5243091f77004542df-lq)

Sometimes, the gouged-out depressions fill up with water, which is then colonized by colourful algae.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-009d18ddb5534bcb82eceb0fc705d1e2-lq)

Erosion has created many other spectacular features on tepuis. There are innumerable caverns beneath the tabletops, most of them unexplored. As they are formed of quartzite, an incredibly hard mineral, they must have taken hundreds of millions of years to form, and may be the oldest caves on Earth.

Some of the chambers are massive (look at the size of the person in the bottom left, below), and one - Abismo Guy Collet - is the deepest cave in all of South America, at a depth of 671 metres. It’s also the world’s deepest quartzite cave.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d0226a6ac3462cb83196c848d594061e-lq)

Inside the caverns, there are subterranean lakes and rivers, bizarre rock formations, ancient microbial growths, and wildlife such as blind fish, scorpions, spiders and giant cave crickets.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2aba38b99b25ef8d294747081dd53205-pjlq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-714880e2e8dd71f45a4c9ef9c76c9bba-pjlq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-df0460ad3ef2e8b6f333f687cd6b4717-pjlq)

When the rock above these caverns collapse, sinkholes form. There are many sinkholes pockmarking Venezuela’s tepuis, some of them measuring over 300 metres, both in diameter and depth.

Cerro Sarisariñama, a specific tepui, is particularly famous for its holes, which are themselves so isolated that there may be species at the bottom endemic to each particular sinkhole.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1ccca2f11e524b580c4b0da19dc35c16-lq)

And then of course there are the waterfalls. When rivers spill over the edge of the mesas, they form some of the most spectacular falls on Earth. The most well-known is Angel Falls, the world’s tallest waterfall, plunging nearly a kilometre down to the lowlands below.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c01f6cc39f13a3f9486f001962677ab7-lq)

Other notable examples include Kukenán Falls, which isn’t quite as towering, but still extraordinarily tall at 610 metres:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-187ac13ecb616e2172857b35336af932-lq)

And Kaieteur Falls, the world’s largest single-drop waterfall in terms of total volume:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-74594e71518f0d2303461cd479d318a6-lq)

Now, let’s take a look at the wildlife found on these sky islands. In the bare limestone pavements and stone forests, there isn’t much real estate for plant life, but a handful of hardy species eke out an existence in the cracks.

Some plant species here are only found on one particular tepui, and about a third of the total flora is endemic to the Guiana Shield. Bromeliads, close relatives of the pineapple, are especially common.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-65a706d9b257378022fe22b1b0bcd6d4-lq)

The small trees which manage to grow on the rocks, such as Bonnetia roraimae, are quite alien indeed.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-27b6fdf48cb77187d0cafd1977bf0685-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ba820ccff8876b82861d0efa2da0d92b-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5e80b89c031fe11efccb1ae39fed9078-lq)

The reddish colour of their leaves is due to anthocyanin pigments, which help protect them against extremes of weather. The red-brown hue of the vegetation on some tepuis can even be seen from space:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-24cb0b17ac522c97f2cfd274d34ff9e3-pjlq)

Another thing about these rocky areas is that what soil there is is very thin and poor in nutrients. As a result, some plants use an alternative source of nutrition - animals. Carnivorous flora is common here, including pitcher plants which drown insects in digestive nectar:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b02acf9be2183e17c0e1d81c92b6c285-pjlq)

And sundews. Their leaves are covered in mucus-coated hairs, and when flies get stuck in the secretion, the leaf rolls up, constricting the prey and slowly digesting it.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-98df90397ee07af881d71b53f2017b18-lq)

The conditions atop tepuis are not always so unforgiving, however. Some summits feature shrublands, savannahs, and dense tropical forests.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-708ad11fbe510971bb638020106a29b8)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d8907b772ef8327332908fd9446023db-pjlq)

Then there’s the animal inhabitants. Just like the plants, tepui fauna shows high levels of endemism, meaning that many species are found nowhere else. The limited space and scarcity of food mean that there aren’t any very big animals atop the plateaus, but there’s still plenty of fascinating wildlife.

Although colonist species from the lowlands probably do come in every now and then, most of the wildlife on the tepuis is likely descended from animals that were there before the surrounding land was eroded away. Their ecosystems guarded by sheer cliffs, said animals evolved in isolation from the rest of the world.

Let’s start with the endemic birds. This includes the tepui tinamou, an elusive ground-dwelling bird:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-429f3a10e8de82dcc629f520ee29264c-lq)

The Roraiman nightjar, which is nocturnal:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-139fa99f029b3a01974f895e2554bcb8-lq)

A wide variety of hummingbirds, including the tepui goldenthroat and the peacock coquette (pictured):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fc7f0ff6acd037b9330991abe60628a5-lq)

The tepui parrotlet, which commutes between mountaintops in flocks of several hundred:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-92f2068025732aec52497839291cb4ec-lq)

The greater flowerpiecer, often found on the barren karst rocks, which perforates the base of flowers to access nectar:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-566711fc0d19b005f5038f624ce95ce1-lq)

The colourful tepui brushfinch:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ccb806a15ea9fd2ed82249fd846d6627-lq)

And many birds in the group Tyranni, such as the Roraiman antwren:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-195f37161f9c8a5632f28e2fb6f9d518-lq)

And the striking scarlet-horned manakin, which has a pair of feathery tufts on its head (its “horns”):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-96e08565a494d2b6fc00230d990b7e82-lq)

While the forested foothills of the mesas are rich in mammal fauna, the challenging conditions at the top (and the inaccessibility) mean that there aren’t many mammals here. Those that are are usually quite small.

Some endemic examples include Tyler’s mouse-opossum, which I don’t think has ever been photographed (a close relative is shown):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-73ee189cc08d56afafec5d40ee574320-lq)

McConnell's climbing rat (again, a closely related species is is shown below):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-29aa7f2697df6cca428b259aedb6abf6-lq)

Isabelle’s ghost bat (again, not the exact same species in the photo):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7b6bbdebddd316be36a27cd7d2d78c5d-lq)

And the prickly Roraima mouse, which was thought extinct until its rediscovery in 2009. The picture is correct this time.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-41757d2752767112cd2e2648ba226999-lq)

What’s especially interesting about this mouse is that its closest genetic relatives are not found on the lowlands surrounding the tepuis, but way over atop the Brazilian Shield on the other side of the Amazon Basin. This is because its ancestors inhabited a vast South American plateau which has now been mostly eroded. In the remaining Guianan and Brazilian shields, this lineage of mice has survived.

There are only two “large" animals which are definitively known to live on top of tepuis: the brown-nosed coati and the southern tamandua, a species of anteater. We have photographic evidence in both cases.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9de74e5a9ed6ef0b2db31236ba8de148-pjlq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6f0c5c07c78a0de592e4b84abea7b092-pjlq)

There are, however, reports of giant anteaters, pale-throated sloths and even jaguars from the summits. None of these animals have been observed here in modern times, though, and the last claim is especially dubious.

Now for the herpetofauna; the reptiles and amphibians. There are many endemic species, including an incredible diversity of frogs, of which 90 percent are endemic, but not too many which really stand out.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6e13f3eb2c0b7943bdf03fa17c07fa08-lq)

I will however mention a few, such as the lizard Pantepuisaurus rodriguesi. It's not just an endemic species, but a whole unique genus, found only on tepuis.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9ed4d405df304c1fcf77937aae0568c6-lq)

Its close relative, Riolama inopinata, is also endemic, and has a striking red colouration.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-94b12c1858dadc85952cccd332d03e1f-pjlq)

There's also the Neblina anole, a fairly large lizard which can extend a brightly coloured dewlap from its throat:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-31e70b9142e480305a8d872216efd462-pjlq)

The Roraima bush toad, a creature that — when threatened — curls up and rolls away:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c6d9126ed46f8abe1a98c044cfbd2e54-pjlq)

And the tepui treefrog, which carries its young on its back.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dcf89777c8479e0935cdb4efce215b4f-pjlq)

The last component of the tepui wildlife left to review is the invertebrate fauna. There are countless endemic beetles, snails, butterflies, and even aquatic insects and crustaceans in underground rivers.

The only endemic arthropod species which I find particularly noteworthy are an assortment of freshwater crabs recently discovered in the mountains' forests.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bc91180274bc6d85bf96247695e8e381-pjlq)

So, that's basically everything you need to know about these extraordinary evolutionary laboratories. There is doubtless much left to discover here; many tepuis have long been near-impossible to access even by helicopter, but they're beginning to reveal their secrets.

Thank you everyone for reading! I had a lot of fun composing this answer, so hopefully you'll get some enjoyment out of it.

## The Prehistoric Paradise of the Pacific
    
**Upvotes**: 4,325 | **Comments**: 160 | **Date**: [Sep-05](https://www.quora.com/Which-island-has-the-most-unusual-plant-life/answer/Gary-Meaney)

The obvious choice would be Socotra, that little Yemeni isle off the Horn of Africa, home to the iconic dragon’s blood tree. However, I think there’s another island which has even more interesting flora - New Caledonia. Sitting in the South Pacific, well over a thousand kilometres from the nearest major landmass, New Caledonia has been biologically isolated since the Cretaceous period.

Because of this, it has unprecedented, record-breaking levels of endemism: around three quarters of its plants are found nowhere else on Earth! Despite only being around the size of the nation of Israel, it’s home to four and a half thousand plant species.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fb533fab61ae1b51ba223d5395f22834)

Back in dinosaur times, New Caledonia broke off from a vast southern super-continent known as Gondwana. Because it remains remote, it still harbours the primeval flora of Gondwana, which has long since gone extinct in most mainland regions. First of all, it is the world’s only true stronghold of the araucarians.

The most famous species today is the monkey puzzle tree, which is native to Chile, but New Caledonia’s most recognizable variety is the coral reef pine, Araucaria columnaris. It has a thin, pillar-like shape, and grows directly on shallow limestone coastlines, especially on the Isle of Pines (a popular tourist attraction).

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0499e714265e91e511537ac0c5685535-lq)

The araucarians are an ancient family of conifer trees, dating back to the beginnings of the Jurassic Period. During the reign of the dinosaurs, they dominated forests all over the world, and were the first trees in Earth’s history to grow extremely tall, as many stood over 60 metres in height. In fact, they are likely the reason sauropods like Brachiosaurus were so damn tall.

Despite their former success, araucarians have been out-competed by more advanced lineages of tree, but they persist in various parts of the Southern Hemisphere. The only place where they still predominate, however, is New Caledonia, which is home to 18 species.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1af820313650a57f325625851b56c46d-lq)

They thrive in all kinds of habitats on the island, from its tropical rainforests and iconic limestone islets to its hilly “maquis” scrub and dry woodlands.

The closest relatives of the araucarians are the podocarps, which were also abundant in Gondwana long ago, and also maintain a strong presence in New Caledonia despite extinction in many other regions. The island has an especially interesting (endemic) genus called Parasitaxus.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2e354ea8f8eb0fe2b09d4166be29117f-lq)

As its name suggests, it’s a parasite - in fact, it’s the only parasitic gymnosperm plant in the world. Believe it or not, it has no roots, and does not perform photosynthesis (hence its rather alien purplish-black colouration). Instead, it grows exclusively out of the roots of a different endemic podocarp species, sucking nutrients from its host.

Another example of New Caledonia’s very unique flora is Amborella. This genus contains a single species, and it is in fact so unique that it has a whole taxonomic family and order to itself! It’s the most primitive flowering plant on Earth, having diverged from the rest a staggering 130 million years ago. It’s a pretty good proxy for what flowers would have looked like while T. rex was roaming the Earth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2149071d6cd12393e8e71b5dfe03c731-lq)

Lastly, I’ll introduce you to Sphaeropteris intermedia, sometimes alternatively called Cyathea intermedia. With a woody trunk that can stand over 30 metres tall, one would think it was a palm tree, but it is in fact a fern - the largest fern on the planet. It further contributes to the exceptionally prehistoric feel to New Caledonia’s vegetation.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f5273f281bf34853c88e0b19ce8822a2-pjlq)

So, those are the most charismatic and fascinating members of New Caledonia’s flora. There are many, many, many more endemic species Mesozoic relics and the like, but I’ve just selected the ones which are of particular interest to the non-botanist.

Now, you all know me by now, so I doubt any of you are surprised that I can’t bring myself to finish this answer without going off-topic and talking about the animals. First things first, the wonderful birdies. The most fascinating of all the island’s avians is undoubtedly the kagu.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-de7f14d76515d01fe7c948defaa80288-pjlq)

This species is highly unique, genetically - it is the sole species in the distinct family Rhynchochetidae, and shares the whole order Eurypygiforms with a single other species, the equally weird sunbittern of South America. The kagu is practically flightless, and probes the forest floor for invertebrate prey.

To prevent soil from getting up its nose as it digs around the ground, it has structures covering its nostrils called nasal corns, something not seen in any other bird. For mysterious reasons, it has around a third of the number of red blood cells most birds have, but thrice the amount of hemoglobin per cell.

Another highly notable New Caledonian avian is the New Caledonian crow, one of the world’s most intelligent birds.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c0846ee84d3945b9713c53cc7834b3d3-lq)

In the wild, they fashion sophisticated tools out of ferns, feathers, thorns, grass and twigs, carefully trimming and folding them down to size. These are used to extract insects from trees, and remarkably, different styles of crow tools can be observed in different parts of New Caledonia. This could mean that these crows are the only non-mammals in the world which have distinct, evolving cultures.

The island is also home to a diverse array of tropical pigeons. Pigeons seem boring to us, but closer to the equator, species are much less drab. Some in New Caledonia are huge, measuring over half a metre in length, whereas others have vibrant colours, such as the cloven-feathered dove.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6c9d20f3547a99f88345ebe3319c497d-lq)

There’s also the crow honeyeater, a strange-looking bird, which - at over 40 cm in length - is the largest species of honeyeater in the world. Sadly, it’s now critically endangered.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-244232d865a6137ccc270c60df0a78a4-lq)

Moving onto the reptiles, we have some very cool geckoes. This includes the rather polite-looking crested gecko, who’s got killer eyelashes:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3933871aaa92b74c69f021c8c09d7779-lq)

And of course Leach’s giant gecko. Measuring up to 36 centimetres from nose to tail, this lumbering beast is the world’s largest gecko.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f4827e93312f91a36f25490eb8fef57a-lq)

On the topic of larger-than-life lizards, here’s the dramatically-named terror skink. It’s even bigger than the aforementioned reptile, at around half a metre in length. It was presumed extinct until being rediscovered in 1933, although to this day it is extremely rare.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-20133d97ee302ca91d3a5743b2a50d3b-lq)

Then there’s a plethora of endemic invertebrate fauna, of course. The largest insect on the island is the giant coconut grasshopper, a freakishly big creepy crawly which is longer than your hand.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-03b6c8ff80967e12164cf1f0290c7425-lq)

What are even more interesting, however, are New Caledonia’s marine invertebrates. For example, its waters are the only home of one of the only four living species of nautilus, Nautilus macromphalus.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-83eab6e2727f0f28b3eed33aa73f6262-lq)

And it has the New Caledonian Barrier Reef, which is the world’s longest continuous barrier reef, stretching across over 1,500 km of shallow sea. That’s about two thirds the length of Australia’s much more famous one, which is actually a smattering of smaller, disconnected reefs! This reef is highly biodiverse, and is home to rare dugongs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3ad34195f1db46234356aef75ec221f2-lq)

My final words in this very long answer about a very small island will be on New Caledonia’s extinct animals, from the time of the last Ice Age, prior to human arrival. Back then, it was home to even more amazing wildlife, such as Mekosuchus inexpectatus.

Up until its extinction 4,000 years ago, it was the very last land-dwelling crocodylian in Earth’s history, the end of a story lasting hundreds of millions of years. It would have been an apex predator on the island, despite being only 2 metres long.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2aa3800d2f4873b4be8ad60910c3fd8e-pjlq)

A possible prey item of Mekosuchus was Sylviornis, the largest galliform ever to live. The galliforms are an order of birds which include chickens and their relatives. Specifically, Sylviornis was a member of the megapodes, odd Australasian birds who incubate their eggs in huge mounds of earth.

It weighed in at about 30 kg, and its skeletal anatomy was markedly similar to that of the non-avian dinosaurs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1832dc7165cd34f5748f5d927fe52cb0-lq)

Other extinct creatures endemic to New Caledonia in the Pleistocene include a variety of other megapodes, flightless rails, huge hawks and several monitor lizards.

* * *

So, what was meant to be a quick answer about some cool plants ended up being an exhaustive ecological and paleontological survey of New Caledonia. If you stuck around for the full article, thank you very much, and if you didn’t, just try to sleep well in the knowledge that you’ll never know what a terror skink is.

## The Siberian Abyss
    
**Upvotes**: 2,158 | **Comments**: 102 | **Date**: [Dec-25](https://www.quora.com/Deep-sea-life-is-weird-But-what-kind-of-animals-live-at-the-bottom-parts-of-the-worlds-deepest-freshwater-lakes/answer/Gary-Meaney)

The world’s deepest and most voluminous lakes form when water gathers in tectonic rifts: the immense volcanic chasms found wherever the Earth’s crust is pulling apart. These rift valley lakes are also the world’s most ancient, as the gorges they fill remain geologically stable for millions of years.

No freshwater lake is deeper, older or more voluminous than Siberia’s Lake Baikal, an unfathomably huge body of water that lies along the rift between the Eurasian and Amurian tectonic plates. I’ve already written about this place and its wildlife five times in previous answers, and for good reason - it contains one of the most fascinating ecosystems on Earth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b9efd746625747495a1cc199f75da7b)

As the world’s seventh-largest lake by surface area, Baikal might not seem so gargantuan at first glance. It owes its size to what lies beneath: its staggering maximum depth of over 1.6 kilometres! The chart below is an almost sobering illustration of this plunge.

If it were emptied of all its water, you could pour all five Great Lakes of North America into the abyss and still not fill it all the way up to its 23,600 cubic kilometre capacity. In fact, Lake Baikal alone is home to nearly a quarter of the Earth’s fresh water, excluding that found deep underground.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-45c6c36a074bd5b7ff22464e4fa33bb0-lq)

Anyways, let’s get to the real subject of this answer: animals. Lake Baikal is essentially the ideal environment for freakish otherworldly creatures to evolve - it ticks all the boxes. It’s super isolated, found smack-dab in the middle of Asia. It’s been stable for a very long time, being around 30 million years old. It’s got extreme conditions, with brutally cold temperatures and a two meter thick sheet of ice covering it in the winter.

Sure enough, Baikal has produced many species which are neither found anywhere else in the world nor resemble anything else in the world. For example, the lake is home to an incredible ten endemic families of amphipod crustaceans, which together comprise a total of more than 360 species. The strangest and most alien family of these is surely Acanthogammaridae.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bc111054addc6d3a1829e3e5a777cbc8-lq)

The 159 species of acanthogammarids that dwell in the gloomy depths of Baikal would look more at home in the methane oceans of Titan than on Earth. Due to the lake’s water being exceptionally rich in oxygen, some of them have grown to dwarf their close relatives elsewhere. Whereas most amphipods are practically microscopic, the acanthogammarid pictured above can grow up to seven centimetres in length. It’s an apex predator in the murky depths.

One could spend a lifetime studying the unique amphipods that dwell in Lake Baikal. Instead, I’ll give you a whirlwind tour of some of the coolest ones. There’s Macrohectopus branickii, a ghostly-looking filter-feeder which wanders the lake’s pelagic zone:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-06a35159c55de735342c4c88c5ded0c6-lq)

Abyssogammarus, an orange, thorny creature which can be found crawling around the very deepest regions of the lakebed:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b8cd44447c30b1e94cd2ca8931806dc-lq)

Micruropus, a positively minuscule little guy who grazes upon phytoplankton:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a57eab87e14304f69a6ba8a7e861a791-lq)

And many, many more…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-402b530807ffa58b2f8fbe385a5adb56-lq)

There is such vast diversity among the amphipods of the lake, and yet as a whole they only make up a fraction of Baikal’s total biodiversity. The most abundant creature of all here is actually an endemic species of copepod called Epischura baikalensis. It’s diminutive in size, measuring a couple of millimetres in length, but so incredibly numerous that it accounts for as much as 90% of Lake Baikal’s total biomass!

E. baikalensis are filter-feeders, floating aimlessly through the depths to passively gather tiny morsels of food. It is estimated that they sift through around a thousand cubic kilometres of water every year. They are so efficacious in this process that they keep the waters remarkably clean - because of them, Lake Baikal is one of the clearest lakes on Earth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1b5fc69ba52b9c27e405dfc2e2fafe1a-lq)

Another unusual group of animals which is copious in Baikal is the sponge family Lubomirskiidae. This taxon is endemic, so the 16 species it contains are not found anywhere else in the world. They all harbour a symbiotic community of dinoflagellates, single-celled algae which use photosynthesis to feed their spongy hosts.

These dinoflagellates give lubomirskiids an unmistakeable luminous green colour, so the areas in which they abound look like verdant underwater forests and meadows. Most of the sponges have a flattened, carpet-like shape, but some species are tall and branching in form.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5c64f7691b04ffc017946510843208ce-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-de418309b9a9236f233e742a3e4d4340-lq)

Now, after briefly discussing some of the lake’s most interesting invertebrates, I ought to introduce a handful of its unique vertebrates. Lets start with fish. There are two whole families of fish which are only found in Lake Baikal, as well as one which is almost exclusive to it. The first of the two unique groups is Abyssocottidae, also known as the deep-water sculpins.

The 24 species of abyssocottids are the world’s deepest-living freshwater fish, together with the next species I’m going to mention. They can be found even in the darkest bowels of the lake, 1.6 kilometres below the surface, where they must withstand an absolutely crushing 16 million pascals of pressure.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-060e218ced16d00100553f4de4f85342-lq)

Believe it or not, the other fish family is far, far stranger. Known as Comephoridae, it contains just two species in one genus. These fish are more commonly referred to as the golomyankas, or Baikal oilfish, and they’re the most bizarre and interesting freshwater fish in the world.

Baikal oilfish get their name from the fact that 40% of their weight consists of fatty oils, which they use to regulate their buoyancy - unlike most fish, they lack swim bladders. Scales, pigmentation, pelvic fins, and cone cells in the eyes are also completely absent. During the day, golomyankas inhabit the very deepest regions of the lake, before ascending all the way to the surface at night, if it’s cold enough.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c9f0266305c23efaf42c5a7e3bf5aa47-lq)

They are highly abundant, accounting for over two thirds of the fish in the lake, with a total estimated biomass of 150,000 tonnes. However, the vast majority of this population is female - curiously, as little as 17% of big Baikal oilfish are male. The females do not lay eggs, but instead give live birth, producing up to 3,000 babies in one go! The birthing process invariably kills the mother.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-33de7ea623fb837b013b7e4fd5b02d35-lq)

Golomyankas are a dietary staple of Lake Baikal’s most famous native animal - the spectacularly spherical Baikal seal, or nerpa. It’s the world’s only species of seal that lives exclusively in a freshwater environment, and also the smallest of the seals, at around only one metre in length.

How a marine mammal managed to find its way into a lake 1.5 thousand kilometres from the sea is quite the mystery. The prevailing hypothesis is that, during the last Ice Age, they migrated to Baikal from the Arctic via a huge system of Siberian lakes and rivers which were created by the glaciers. I wrote about this enigma in detail in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/How-did-a-population-of-landlocked-seals-manage-to-establish-itself-in-Lake-Baikal-of-all-places-at-an-altitude-of-450-m-and-several-hundred-kilometers-from-the-Nearest-coastline/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com").

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-984c7cf79f60e397769dcbf1fb7aa02f-lq)

I suppose the nerpa doesn’t really fit the parameters of your question, seen as it doesn’t dwell in the deepest parts of the lake, but you can’t write an answer about Lake Baikal without mentioning the Baikal seal. They can still travel to impressive depths of up to 400 metres, and hold their breath for more than an hour. They get this ability from the huge volume of blood they carry - several litres in excess of what would be expected for seals of their size!

As said, the vast majority of what Baikal seals eat are golomyankas, although they also dine on a variety of other fish and crustaceans. One very interesting dietary habit they have is the eating of Kessler’s sculpin, a fish that nestles in the silty lakebed. The grit and sediment inside these sculpins scrapes the seals’ digestive systems clean of parasites.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-45d525866ee725adb11d98b385eebc10-lq)

So, thank you very much for reading my summary of the most remarkable and outlandish wildlife that one can find in the Siberian abyss that is Lake Baikal. If you celebrate, I hope you have a very happy Christmas, and if you don’t, I hope you have a fantastic day nonetheless.

## California's Lost World
    
**Upvotes**: 110 | **Comments**: 10 | **Date**: [8mo](https://www.quora.com/Which-parts-of-the-contiguous-United-States-have-the-most-interesting-wildlife/answer/Gary-Meaney)

The Channel Islands of California have a unique selection of flora and fauna which really don’t get enough love, in my opinion. Despite being a stone’s throw away from some of America’s largest cities, they retain a diverse array of wildlife, some of which is found nowhere else.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c996ca754b0ed36d64e866d4c6988b2b-lq)

There are endemic species of birds, and even mammals, which is surprising for such small islands. Here are some of the amazing animals unique to the archipelago:

*   The island fox, a tiny canine which experienced insular dwarfism as it evolved. Despite there being six subspecies, it has a bizarre lack of genetic diversity not seen in other animals.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-30c77e20c5619ad76bea019eaaeb37a3-lq)

*   The island spotted skunk, a subspecies of the Western spotted skunk found on the mainland. It is distinguished from its continental cousin by a shorter tail, smoother fur and a different colour pattern.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7c3410c1409c4dfa5f78ca15b934edb9-lq)

*   The ashy storm petrel, a small, fish-eating seabird. Strictly speaking, it isn’t entirely endemic, as it’s found on the nearby Farallon Islands and Mexico’s Coronado Islands.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bb4f1b6bbc206833ce5f5884127c4a99-lq)

*   The island scrub jay. This colourful bird is found only on Santa Cruz island, and differs from its mainland relatives by its smaller size (insular dwarfism again) and longer beak, which is adapted to crack open acorns.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6698b68feda11d4e5376739660fec948-lq)

*   The San Clemente loggerhead shrike, a subspecies of the loggerhead shrike. As a highly localized population, it’s long been at risk of extinction - in 1998, there were as little as 14 individuals alive. Currently there are around 40 mated pairs on the island.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9f3f14692693658be965f5b7d3f1d816-pjlq)

In terms of reptiles and amphibians, there are a few more endemics, such as the island night lizard and the Channel Islands slender salamander. And those are just some of the wild endemic animals - there are actually two breeds of livestock originating from the Channel islands; a sheep and a goat.

Furthermore, there are plenty of plants found only in the archipelago, some of which are under threat of extinction due to invasive flora. Santa Cruz is one of only two places you can find the iconic but critically endangered Torrey pine.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-01672477a80afac519eadd35fd0f56a7-pjlq)

The other location - San Diego - is notably further away from the islands than you’d expect. This is because the San Diego area and what would become the Channel Islands were once right next to each other, but the Pacific Plate has since drifted northwest, taking the pines with it.

Also, the islands are rich in non-endemic wildlife; especially in the surrounding waters. They lie in the path of the cold California Current, where untapped nutrients from the deep are forced up to the surface. This phenomenon is known as upwelling, and it creates bountiful marine ecosystems.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-136045682c79fea6b2aa91972883f4bd-lq)

There are several species of whale which congregate off the Channel Islands, including humpback whales, grey whales, blue whales, and possibly even North Pacific right whales, one of the world’s most endangered cetaceans.

Other marine mammals found in the area include sea otters, California sea lions, Steller sea lions, Guadalupe fur seals, northern elephant seals, and harbour seals, pictured below.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9243da3689d5ff0446b58ff2a5ca7a36-lq)

On some of the islands, the beaches host huge colonies of the California sea lions, which often intermingle with elephant seals.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9762c81feecfbf1b9bf21bfda1189b9e-lq)

So, you’ve got a fairly little-known cluster of islands, surrounded by rich kelp forests, home to a wealth of marine mammals, two unique breeds of livestock, groves of a super-rare conifer tree, and even an endemic species of canid.

The wildlife might not be as flashy as that of Yellowstone or the Everglades, but I still think it’s a good candidate for this question, because it’s so damn interesting. Thanks everyone for reading, have a great day.
