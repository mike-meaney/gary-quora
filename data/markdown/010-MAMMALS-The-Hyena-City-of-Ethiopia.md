## 10. The Hyena City of Ethiopia

In the walled town of Harar, Ethiopia, the locals have a curious and starkly unique relationship with local spotted hyenas.

There are currently two hyena feeding places which tourists can visit, at the shrines of Aw Sofi and Aw Aboker respectively. (I’ve heard that the latter one is more formal, more touristy, and - to a degree - more contrived). At these places, “hyena men” throw scraps of meat to wild hyenas which have become habituated to this and come to the feeding places on a nightly basis.

At the Aboker feeding places, visitors can even have hyenas pull meat from their mouths.

This tradition, which started about sixty years ago, is by no means just a tourist attraction. At night, many Harari butchers throw their leftovers out onto the streets to waiting hyenas, with no tourists in sight. The hyenas of Harar are said to be special (and that is why they behave so peacefully), for they have become vessels through which one can communicate with saints. They’re also believed to eat malevolent demons - jinn - and when a hyena attacks a human, it is because that person was possessed by one.

Then there’s this annual festival called Ashura, held on a hilltop outside the town. Three mounds of porridge are laid out on a broad, flat stone, and the attendants wait for hyenas to come out and eat it. It’s kind of like the Harari version of groundhog day - if the hyena eats most of the porridge but leaves a bit, the coming year will be prosperous. If he eats it all, there will be famine, and if he eats little, war.

Anyway, virtually all the locals at Harar adore hyenas, so much so that if a hyena kills one of their livestock, many put it down to themselves not feeding it enough. If only American ranchers had this attitude to wolves.

Similarly, the hyenas have become fully habituated to the local traditions and have very little fear of people, especially people they know well. Dogs were probably domesticated by starting out eating human scraps - interestingly similar to what’s going in in Harar.

If this ritual was to continue for centuries, I could easily see spotted hyenas becoming a domesticated animal. The most habituated individuals are the ones most likely to come for food and gain a selective advantage, so over time they will get more and more familiar with humans until they’re practically dogs.
