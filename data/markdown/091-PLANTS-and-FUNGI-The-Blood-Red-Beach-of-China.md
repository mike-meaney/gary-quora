In northeastern China, a great watercourse called the Liao River winds its way into the shallow Bohai Sea. As it approaches the coast, the surrounding terrain flattens out, and it spreads out to form a vast tidal wetland. One corner of this marsh has become famous for its stunning flora: Red Beach.

The deposited soil in Red Beach (known as 红海滩 in China) is very alkaline, and the land is flooded with salty seawater, making it a hostile environment for conventional plant life. One hardy species, however, has found it to be the perfect place to thrive: Suaeda salsa.

This amaranth is well-adapted to the harsh conditions, and is the dominant form of vegetation in the wetland. When autumn comes round, and the salinity of the water increases, the Suaeda starts producing protective pigments called betacyanins. They are the same molecules that give beetroots their colour, and turn the whole landscape from green to red.

This beautiful seasonal change of hue attracts many tourists each year. Visitors can view the marshes from elevated wooden boardwalks which zig-zag over the water.

Thankfully, tourism here likely doesn’t have severe impact on the natural ecosystem, due to the upraised nature of the walkways. Red Beach is home to plenty of biodiversity, even including rare spotted seals! Also, like most large wetlands, it’s a haven for birds.

Gulls, swans, ducks, geese, herons and egrets all roam the area. The most iconic Red Beach bird of all is the red-crowned crane, one of the most endangered cranes on Earth. It migrates to the Liao River Delta in the summer to breed, while it’s not too cold, before flying back south to spend the winter.

So, does this wetland have more beautiful vegetation than any other locale in the world? I think it’s a strong candidate. One thing’s for sure, though: there aren’t many places on this planet which look like the inside of a red velvet cake.

Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed, have a great day!
