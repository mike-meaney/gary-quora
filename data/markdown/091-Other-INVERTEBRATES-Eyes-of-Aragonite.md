## 91. Eyes of Aragonite

If there’s one group of animals which can compete with the outright weirdness of mantis shrimps’ eyes, it’s the chitons. Chitons, or polyplacophores, are sea-dwelling mollusks which essentially resemble armoured slugs. They have a shell composed of eight plates, or valves, and will curl up into a ball when threatened.

All chitons have organs known as aesthetes, which are patches of light-sensitive cells, under their shells. However, many species have gone a step further and evolved full-on eyes, lens and all.

Chiton eyes are… bizarre. Thousands of them cover the shell, so that together they act as a much larger compound eye and grant the chiton 180 degree vision, which by itself is pretty amazing. However, what’s weirdest about these eyes is what they’re made of.

Their lenses are made out of the same mineral, aragonite, as the rest of the shell, so chitons could be said to see with their armour. They’re the only animals in the world which have eyes made of rock!

If that wasn’t enough, chiton eyes evolved more recently than any other animal’s eyes - they appear in the fossil record about 10 million years ago. A fascinating organ for a fascinating group of animals. As an aside, this is the largest chiton, the gumboot chiton:

Growing to 36 centimetres in length, it’s often referred to as the “wandering meatloaf”. Unlike other chitons, it has a layer of leathery skin over its shell, and eats using rows of teeth made of magnetite.

We’re getting really off track now, but as a final fun fact, researchers in California took inspiration from the growth of gumboot chiton teeth to develop a new way of growing nanomaterials for batteries and solar cells. It’s a great example of biomimicry.
