## 75. Zoology's Greatest Mystery

One of zoology’s greatest unsolved mysteries surrounds the obscure facetotectans. They are a subset of crustaceans, and have been found in all the world’s oceans, from the Arctic to the tropics. Eleven different species are known thus far, but it’s likely if not certain that more remain undiscovered.

We’ve been finding them since 1887 - well, that is, we’ve been finding their larvae. To this day, nobody has seen an adult facetotectan. We don’t know what they turn into when they grow up. So far, we have identified two larval stages in the wild. The first stage is known as the nauplius, and looks like this:

Nauplii have a rounded shield covering their head, and a stubby tail. They can be as little as 0.025 cm in length. Each nauplius actually goes through five separate slightly different forms, called instars, before metamorphosing into its second stage of development: the cyprid.

Cyprids are a bit larger, and a little more recognizable as crustaceans, with a functioning pair of eyes and a long, segmented body. Those little appendages that look like legs are actually its gills, although they can be used for walking. The cyprid form can also secrete some kind of adhesive substance.

We have made one breakthrough towards figuring out what grown-up facetotectans look like. In 2008, a team of researchers injected cyprids with a growth hormone called 20-hydroxyecdysone. This stimulated them to shed their exoskeletons and progress to a new phase of life. The results were… bizarre, to say the least.

This new form was not an adult, but some kind of juvenile stage which they dubbed the ypsigon. Its eyes and muscles had all but worn away, and had neither limbs nor segmentation - it was little more than a microscopic slug. Similar to earthworms, ypsigons move via peristalsis - contracting and relaxing in a rhythmic, wave-like motion.

The discovery of this form was a tantalizing step towards solving this mystery. Perhaps adult facetotectans have eluded us by being parasites, living hidden inside larger organisms. If this is the case, it would be one of several curious similarities between this group and another outlandish type of crustacean…

If you’re familiar with some of [my older answers](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-oddest-lifeform-ever-discovered/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"), you may recall the rhizocephalan barnacles - in my opinion, the strangest animals on the planet. They too start out life as primitive nauplii, before morphing into squishy degenerate forms and parasitizing other animals. Facetotectans are indeed very closely related to barnacles, so they may have more in common with rhizocephalans than we thought.

It may be a long time before we discover the true identity of these creatures, but I have a feeling that whatever they turn out to be will be unexpected. Thank you for reading, have a great day.
