## 82. Bisexual Squids and Their Bizarre Brethren

Perhaps the vampire squid would have to take that crown, but he gets a lot of press, so today I’ll instead write about several almost as fascinating runners up. Here goes.

*   Cocked-eyed squids. There are numerous species in this genus, and they are all distinguished by amazingly bizarre eyes. The right eye is quite typical for a squid, however, the left eye is twice as large, yellow-green, shaped like a tube, and is angled directly upward. The right eye scans for the bioluminescence of prey, while the other detects predators overhead.

*   Glass squids. The species in this family seem to have the most random hodgepodge of characteristics you could imagine. Most species are transparent, some are bioluminescent. Their tentacles have hooks on them. They can retract their heads into their bodies like turtles. And, if that wasn’t enough, one species - the colossal squid - is the largest invertebrate on the planet, weighing nearly half a metric tonne.

*   Octopoteuthis deletron. This species has no common name, but it’s pretty damn fascinating. First of all, there’s its defense strategy: in the event of a predator attacking, the squid will adhere one of its arms onto said predator and propel itself away, leaving the tentacle behind. Additionally, since you can’t really determine the sex of something in the deep sea, males will mate with all individuals of the same species they find - just in case.

*   Bigfin squids. These squids are shrouded in mystery; we haven’t even found an adult specimen yet. They have incredibly large fins, but their tentacles are weirdest of all. They are all identical (something seen in no other squid), they are held in an “elbowed” position, and they’re around 20 times longer than the body. It’s speculated that these ghostly creatures drag their tentacles along the seafloor to catch their food.

There are a lot more weird and alien squids than just the vampire. Squids are a diverse bunch - not only do they contain these oddities, but the largest, fastest-swimming, and some of the most intelligent invertebrates on the planet. Maybe in a future answer I’ll write about some of the weird prehistoric squids we know of…
