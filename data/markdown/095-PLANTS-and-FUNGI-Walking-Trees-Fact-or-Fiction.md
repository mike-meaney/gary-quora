Socratea exorrhiza, the walking tree

S. exorrhiza is a species of palm tree, found in the tropical forests of South and Central America. It can grow to 25 metres in height, and its most notable feature are its bizarre, stilt-like roots, which hold it above the ground.

The purpose of these strange roots was greatly puzzling for many a 20th century botanist. In 1961, a well-known biologist called E. J. H. Corner hypothesized that they allowed the tree to stay above the water when swampy forest floors flooded. However, no evidence was found to support that hypothesis.

Nearly two decades later, in 1980, the scientist John H. Bodley proposed an altogether more radical idea - the roots enabled the palms to walk.

In a way, at least. His idea was that, if a nearby tree fell and knocked the palm over, the Socratea exorrhiza would use its stilt roots to creep away from its initial location and right itself. New roots - still vertical, but perpendicular to the trunk - would grow, and the tree would eventually find itself upright again. The old trunk and roots would rot away, leaving Socratea looking just as it did before - but in a different place.

(Another variation of the hypothesis says that the tree actually tracks moving light from the canopy throughout the year, moving up to a meter annually)

This idea, being so wild, quickly spread, and tour guides often recited it to visitors to the jungles in S. exorrhiza’s range. I remember being told of a walking palm tree as a child, though I obviously didn’t remember its name. In any case, I decided to research it it recently, and found it to be disproven.

Enter Dr. Gerardo Avalos, pictured below with Socratea exorrhiza. He’s perhaps the world’s foremost expert on the tree.

His extensive analysis of the species in 2005 yielded no evidence whatsoever for “walking” abilities. While, occasionally, some roots on one side or another would rot away, the roots clearly couldn’t move and the trunk remained in the same position, regardless of lighting.

So, while a cool idea, it proved to be baseless. Unfortunate, but then again, the plant kingdom has done weirder things.
