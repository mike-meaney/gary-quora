## 85. Whale-Sized Worms and Ginormous Jellies

The bootlace worm, Lineus longissimus, is quite possibly the longest animal in the world. These are a type of aquatic Nemertean, or ribbon worm, which have been recorded at lengths about 60 metres, twice as long as an average blue whale. Here it is:

It’s hard to appreciate its length when it’s all bundled up like that, but I assure you; they’re enormous. Their width however, is significantly less impressive, usually only a few millimetres.

So, as I said, this guy’s a Nemertean, belonging to a phylum of invertebrates most closely related to Lophophorates, and more distantly so to molluscs and segmented worms, or annelids. Nemerteans are characterized by a horrible, slimy proboscis, which can be everted through the oral sphincter.

However, it’s not technically definite that this organism is the longest animal, since Nemerteans are known to be highly variable in terms of elasticity, and can expand their bodies quite dramatically. We do not yet know if bootlace worms can grow to 60 metres in their natural state. The next competitor is the lion’s mane jellyfish, Cyanea capillata.

These have been observed being as long as 37 metres, and are quite huge in other dimensions too. They have a diameter of about 2 metres, more than most people’s height, and up to 1,200 tentacles (I don’t know who the hell gets paid for counting these things). The length isn’t as readily observable as you might think, as the longest tentacles are exceedingly thin and hard to see.

The blue whale, contrary to what another answerer has purported, is neither longest nor second longest, but resides in third place, shortly behind the jellyfish.
