## 96. The Curse of the Bamboo Flower

Roughly every 50 years, Melocanna baccifera flowers. It is a species of bamboo, distributed across India and Southeast Asia, and can grow to be up to 25 metres tall. This cyclical event is known as mautam in some northeast Indian states.

The first record we have of mautam is from the year 1862, in the Mizoram state of India. Directly after the flowering, the region experienced an infestation of black rats and, subsequently, fell into famine. Fast forward to the next mautam, in 1911, another plague of rats. 1958, the same thing.

In fact, this phenomenon - bamboo flowering and then a huge spike in rat numbers - has been seen all over the world, not only in India but also in China, Myanmar, Laos, Japan, Madagascar and South America. This can’t be coincidental.

So what is happening? As it turns out, when M. baccifera and other bamboo species flower, they release countless seeds, which in turn fuel a population explosion in the local black rats. Once the seeds have all been eaten, the rodents turn to nearby villages to look for food, in what is known as a “rat flood”.

Nowadays, this has long since been realized, and now the Indian government prepares for mautam before the flood hits. The last one was in 2006, and villagers were educated about pest control and encouraged to grow crops whose scents would ward off rats.

The next famine is expected to hit Mizoram in the mid-2050s, and the local Mizos know it. It must be strange to live in the knowledge that such an event is impending. It's also pretty amazing that the reproductive cycle of a plant has such a major effect on the lives of so many.
