One of the most iconic animals which inhabits the dry grasslands of Southern Brazil is the maned wolf, Chrysocyon brachyurus. Of all the extant dogs, the maned wolf is perhaps the most herbivorous.

In fact, the majority of its diet is made up of plant matter. It is from the plants it eats that it gets the chemical pyrazine, which tends to make its urine smell like cannabis (which once set police in Rotterdam on the hunt for illegal smokers).

Of all the flora it eats, it seems that one kind is its favourite - the so-called “wolf apple”, or fruta-do-lobo. It is in truth not an apple, but a sort of cross between a tomato and an eggplant, and up to half of a maned wolf’s diet can be solely wolf apples.

Incidentally, it is thought that is partially because the tannin-rich fruits kill infectious giant kidney worms, which could otherwise kill the animal.

Don’t worry, I’m getting to the point soon.

For unknown reasons, when maned wolves defecate, they usually do so directly onto the nests of leafcutter ants. While this may seem rude, this is actually very valuable for the ants, for they cultivate fungus gardens.

Fungi, as you probably know, like to grow on animal feces, so the leafcutters transport the dung into their underground nests. However, before they feed it to their cultivars, they take out the wolf apple seeds and leave them in special refuse piles.

Amidst all the ants’ organic waste - which is an excellent fertilizer - the seeds germinate, creating more wolf apple plants for the maned wolves to eat. Thus, the cycle repeats - and it’s almost, but not quite, as if the canines, and not only the ants, have their own form of agriculture.
