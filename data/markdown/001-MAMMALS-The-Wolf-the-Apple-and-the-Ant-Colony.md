## 1. The Wolf, the Apple and the Ant Colony

One of the most iconic animals which inhabits the dry grasslands of Southern Brazil is the maned wolf, Chrysocyon brachyurus. Of all the extant dogs, the maned wolf is perhaps the most herbivorous. In fact, the majority of its diet is made up of plant matter. It gets the chemical pyrazine from the vegetation it eats, which tends to make its urine smell strongly of cannabis Once, in a zoo in Rotterdam, maned wolf pee had local policeon the hunt for illegal smokers!

Of all the flora it eats, its favourite is seemingly the so-called “wolf apple”, or fruta-do-lobo. This fruit is not technically an apple, being more similar to a cross to tomato and an eggplant. Up to half of a maned wolf’s diet can be solely wolf apples.

Why are the canines so fond of these fruits? It is thought that it's partially because the fruits, being rich in tannins, kill infectious giant kidney worms, which could otherwise prove fatal for the animal.

For unknown reasons, when maned wolves defecate, they usually do so directly onto the nests of leafcutter ants. While this may seem rude, this is actually very valuable for the insects. Inside their colonies lie vast gardens of cultivated fungi. Fungi, as you probably know, like to grow on animal feces, so the leafcutters can use it to feed their cultivars. They transport the dung into their underground nests, but only after removing the undigested wolf apple seeds, which are left in refuse piles.

Amidst all the ants’ organic waste - which proves to be an excellent fertilizer - the seeds germinate, creating more wolf apple plants for the maned wolves to eat. Thus, the cycle repeats - and it’s almost as if the canines, and not only the ants, have their own form of agriculture.
