## 18. The Seafaring Bat and its Supersized Feet

There’s a species of bat which dwells on coastlines in the Gulf of California, known as Myotis vivesi. As bats go, it has enormous feet:

Tipped with wicked claws, no less:

So, why the Hobbitish proportions? Thankfully, they are not an adaptation for clawing open human scalps. Rather, they’re for fishing.

Among bats, there are other species which hunt aquatic prey, certainly, but M. vivesi is special. It doesn’t just scoop fish out of streams in the rainforest - it’s arguably a marine mammal. It feeds exclusively on fish, crustaceans, and sometimes even algae. Cooler still, it has evolved concentrated urine, which means it can drink seawater.

Besides their giant feet, the other feature of this bat which I find amazing is the uropatagium - the membrane of skin between the legs. This is actually used as a fishing net - fish get caught in it before the claws close in and grasp them. How mindblowing is that?

Additionally, the uropatagium is lined with very long, fine hairs. Their function is mysterious - some say they’re sensory in purpose, others hypothesize that they’re used to catch small crustaceans.

Above, you can see the bat’s needle-like teeth, which are specially adapted for slicing through slippery fish. Myotis vivesi only visit dry land at dawn to roost, which they do on coastal rock formations and caves. Interestingly enough, they have been known to share their roosting spots with petrels (large seabirds).

So, it turns out this little sea bat is a lot more than a pair of big feet. Myotis vivesi is yet another example of how diverse the 1,200 species of bat really are.
