Flatfish! Chances are you’ve eaten one before. We tend to ignore them, take them for granted. They are so commonplace in our lives that it’s hard to see how bizarre they really are.

First of all, you have their defining characteristic - the fact that both of their eyes are on the same side of their head. The fact that they managed to gradually evolve this setup over millions of years is mind-blowing in itself.

To see how this fish “should” look, you have to turn your head sideways. From an anatomical perspective, that’s not the fish’s back you’re seeing, it’s its flank. Before anybody comments that this “could not have evolved”, I’ll add that this transition is well-understood and supported by both fossil and ontogenetic evidence.

Back to square one, lads.

Now, what’s interesting is that all flatfish are born symmetrical, like other fish. That’s not to say the larvae are boring - in fact, they too are often ridiculously bizarre:

To make matters more confusing, there is one species which breaks the status quo and has one eye on the top of its head. This is the rather gruesome-looking Greenland halibut, which has reversed its evolutionary history somewhat to attain better peripheral vision:

This also gives it the appearance of having one eye when it’s lying on its side.

For the more conforming species, however, both eyes will either be on the left or the right side. Well… if you’ve been paying attention, it might not surprise you very much that it’s even more complicated than this, because in one family - the spiny turbots:

Individuals of the same species may be “left-eyed” or “right-eyed”! Furthermore, in a given species of spiny turbot, the ratio between the two types is usually around 1:1. In the natural world, there is always an exception - or, more often, four or five different exceptions - to the rule.

And, believe me, it gets weirder. For example, did you know that many flatfishes can change colour to camouflage, like chameleons?

The below photos are all of the same fish, taken in a very short space of time:

This one can even camouflage against a goddamn checkerboard:

They do this in the same way which cephalopods change colour, with specially adapted chromatophores - these cells-turned-organs are essentially little balloons containing many granules of pigmentation, which can be inflated or deflated at will.

This poor guy damaged his eyesight, and thus cannot adapt his coloration to the environment effectively:

In addition to all this, some species here and there have more weird features and adaptations. Some have their eyes mounted on rotating “turrets”, so that they can swivel around independently of one another.

Others have eyes which are spaced really widely apart:

And then there’s one - the leopard flounder - which has these strange stalks trailing from the back of its eye stumps, which are used for territorial and courtship display.

And then there’s another one - Asterorhombus intermedius - which has a little wiggly lure sticking out of its mouth to attract smaller fish into its maw.

If you look closely, you can see that the lure is in fact part of its dorsal fin (bottom left), and would once have been one of the fin rays.

Surely that’s it. Surely these guys couldn’t get any weirder…

Wrong again! We’ve got huge-mouthed flatfish!

Flatfishes with fans of neon-blue spines!

Amorphous blobby flatfish!

Biofluorescent flatfish which glow orange-red under UV light!

Flatfish that mimic toxic turbellarian worms!

Um… this thing!

You’ve got to be kidding me…

What even are flatfish?

I think you get my point. Flatfish are incredibly weird and cool. Showing that was the… sole purpose of my answer.
