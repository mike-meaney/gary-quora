## 33. The Solar Salamander, and Friends

Salamanders! If you are under the impression that these amphibians are plain and boring, then you could be forgiven, but you’re also in dire need of this answer. There are over 600 species of salamander, and they range from human-sized lumbering brutes with vicious teeth to emaciated, cave-dwelling, eel-like weirdos.

Let’s run through some of the most bizarre and fascinating salamanders of the world…

Giant salamanders

There are 4 species in this family: the smallest, the hellbender, lives in the eastern US. There’s another in Japan and two in China. The largest of all is the South China giant salamander, which can reach a staggering 1.8 metres in length and weigh 65 kg, making it the world’s largest amphibian.

Giant salamanders have terrifyingly sharp teeth, and males can even decapitate each other in territorial battles. If that wasn’t bad enough, Japanese giant salamanders secrete a gluey white slime which smells like, as one author put it, the “rankest smelling public urinal crossed with the stale smell of certain bodily secretions”. Another interesting fact about them is that males, rather than females, incubate the eggs.

Spotted salamander

While it mightn’t look strange outwardly, this species is incredibly unique. It’s the world’s only photosynthetic vertebrate! A few hours after a spotted salamander lays its eggs, green algae known as Oophila amblystomatis colonize said eggs, insinuate themselves into the unborn amphibians’ cells, and start photosynthesizing.

The algae turn the sunlight’s energy into glucose, which the gestating salamanders then absorb for nourishment. This means that the spotted salamander is not only the only photosynthetic vertebrate, but also the only vertebrate which has symbiotic organisms living in its cells (unless you count mitochondria). You could even call it… a solarmander.

Axolotl

This critically endangered salamander is an obvious choice. It is, or rather was, a lake-dwelling creature, having no lungs, but red, frilly gills instead. They originally inhabited lakes in the Valley of Mexico, but the massive urbanization of Mexico City reduced these lakes to a handful of polluted canals - hence, they’re critically endangered in the wild.

Most axolotls are brown or olive, but they can be white (as seen above), grey or black too. They’re neotenic, meaning that they don’t metamorphose into adults but stay as “larvae” for their whole lives.

What’s more, they have the amazing ability to regenerate after wounds which would otherwise be critical - they can regrow eyes, and even parts of the brain. The genome of the axolotl is huge; with 32 billion base pairs, it’s ten times the size of the human genome.

Lungless salamanders

The plethodontids, or lungless salamanders, are the most diverse salamander family, and among their 370 species are some which have evolved some really wacky behaviours. There’s one, the Mount Lyell Salamander, that lives on the slopes of California’s Sierra Nevada and escapes from predators by coiling its body, tucking in its limbs, and rolling downhill.

Then there’s the genus Bolitaglossa, which has the fastest and most powerful muscle of any animal in the world. Its tongue can shoot out at insect prey to full extension in a mind-blowing 3 milliseconds, producing 18,000 watts per kilogram in the process. There’s even a species which reportedly feeds on the fruiting bodies of fungi, which would make it the only fungivorous amphibian.

Sharp-ribbed newts

The sharp-ribbed newts (which are, of course, salamanders rather than newts) are found only in North Africa and Iberia. The most fascinating thing about them is definitely their incredibly unique defense mechanism. When threatened by predators, they thrust their sharp rib bones outward, which pierce through their skin.

Furthermore, the ribs are coated in poison, so this behaviour could be seen as a primitive, basic form of venom injection. Interestingly enough, one species - the Iberian ribbed newt - has been sent to outer space and studied six times. first in 1985 and most recently in 2005.

Sirens

You could make a case for sirens being the world’s weirdest salamanders, for sure. They’re fully aquatic, and have taken on a serpentine, eel-like form, with tiny, underdeveloped forelimbs, doing away with the hind pair entirely. Like the aforementioned axolotl, they breathe using frilly, frond-like gills. Modern sirens never exceed 70 cm in length, but one prehistoric species was a formidable 1.6 metres.

Due to their diet of hard-shelled clams and molluscs, they’ve also lost their teeth, opting instead for a powerful crushing beak made of keratin. Another bizarre aspect of their eating habits is that they are the only plant-eating salamanders, feeding on algae and water plants. During the dry season, some species have the ability to secrete a cocoon of mucus around their body, protecting them in the mud until the waters returns.

Mole salamanders

Though they don’t look the part, mole salamanders are close relatives of the axolotl, and are amazing in that they are entirely female. Yes, you heard me right; in some American populations of mole salamanders, all offspring are born female and remain that way until death. Their method of reproduction is one of the most unique and fascinating in the animal kingdom.

To reproduce, these salamanders have to be impregnated by a male from a different local salamander species. However, the offspring will not be a hybrid; the male’s sperm is used to fertilize the egg, but after that, the female discards the sperm cell’s genome and switches to asexual development. That being said, in some cases the female actually “steals” some of the male’s genes; a process known as kleptogenesis.

Olm

Lastly, we’ll finish with another awesome species: the olm. It’s the only vertebrate in Europe which lives only in caves, and is often referred to as the “human fish”. Inhabiting the countless caverns found in southeastern Europe’s Dinaric Karst region, the olm is completely blind, has no pigment in its skin, and stays in its larval form for its life.

While it cannot see, the olm has incredible senses of smell, hearing, and can even sense weak electric fields; studies suggest that it actually uses the Earth’s magnetic field as a navigational aid. There’s also a unique subspecies of olm known as the black olm, pictured above, which is a brownish-grey colour and has better vision. This indicates that black olms colonized the underground world more recently.

So, we’ve had huge slimy brutes, photosynthetic vertebrates, neotenic oddballs with a regeneration superpower, ballistic-tongued predators, venomous-ribbed astronauts, beaked plant-eating serpents, all-female species, and blind cave demons. Like I said, if you thought salamanders were boring, you were seriously wrong.
