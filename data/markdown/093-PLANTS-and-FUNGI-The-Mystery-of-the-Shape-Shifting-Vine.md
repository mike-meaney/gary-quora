In my opinion, the most amazing species of mimic is not an animal at all; it’s a rather boring-looking species of plant called Boquila trifoliolata - nicknamed the “chameleon vine”, and for good reason.

Believe it or not, all the above leaves are from the same species of plant. Boquila’s mind-blowing ability is that its leaves change shape to mimic those of the nearest trees. Somehow, their size, shape, stalk and colour morph to blend in with nearby tree leaves, disguising themselves from animals which might eat them.

They can even grow spiny tips on the leaves should the host plant have such spines, and can mimic different types of foliage on the same individual plant. On any one Boquila trifoliolata plant, some leaves might be 10 times the size of others.

But this of course begs the question - how on Earth does it “know” which leaves to mimic? It can’t be by touch, because it doesn’t even require physical contact to mimic. There are currently two hypotheses:

1.  The vine can detect compounds emanating from the local plants, recognizes them, and then uses hormones and signals to change the genetic makeup of the leaves in the area. Of course, this would mean that it must have an internal “database”, if you will, of dozens of local tree species.
2.  An even wilder idea - the chameleon vine is in fact receiving genes from the nearby trees. Horizontal gene transfer is when organisms pass on DNA, but not via producing offspring - it would be like you taking some random person’s genes and using them to look like him.

I think I’d put my money on the first hypothesis, as it seems more grounded. I fail to imagine how horizontal gene transfer could occur between two plants if they weren’t in contact. In any case, it still remains a mystery to this day.

Boquila trifoliolata is one of my favourite species of plant, and I hope you’ve enjoyed learning about it in this answer. Thanks for reading.
