## 79. An Island Ruled by Killer Centipedes

One would think that, with vertebrates having ruled the world’s terrestrial ecosystems for hundreds of millions of years, it would be impossible for such a place to exist on the modern Earth. Surprisingly, one would be wrong. There is one spot which is so small and remote that no predatory land vertebrate of decent size has managed to colonize it - but something else has.

The location I speak of is Phillip Island.

It lies off Norfolk Island, a distant Australian territory, in the stretch of the Pacific sandwiched between New Zealand and [New Caledonia.](https://www.quora.com/Which-island-has-the-most-unusual-plant-life/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") It’s pretty tiny, stretching a couple kilometres from end to end, and pretty barren, with no real human settlement. The scenery on Phillip Island is hauntingly beautiful, a fact it owes to its volcanic cliffs and bright red earth.

In terms of wildlife, there’s not an awful lot going on, to say the least. The island is home to two species of lizard, and about a dozen types of seabird roost on its cliffs. All of these animals are at risk of falling victim to the formidable apex predator of the landmass: the Phillip Island centipede.

With a nasty pair of mandibles and an extremely venomous bite, this arthropod has become a specialist hunter of vertebrates - fish, skinks, geckos, birds… in other words, anything and everything which crawls, swims or flies on its island. Often, it slays animals many times larger than itself, though that’s not to say it’s small - it measures more than 23 centimetres, or 9 inches, in length!

In particular, the centipede is partial to chicks of the black-winged petrel, Phillip Island’s most ubiquitous seabird. Despite outweighing their predator by far, the chicks are defenseless while holed up in their burrows, and are typically eaten alive. Every year, nearly 4,000 birds fall prey to centipedes. This is not a concern for conservationists, however, as natural predation is all part of the balance of the ecosystem.

As said, they don’t just eat seabirds - the two native species of lizard are frequent prey too. Here’s a great photo of a centipede chowing down on a Günther island gecko.

Remarkably, this incredible carnivore was only described in 1984. At the time, Phillip Island centipedes were exceptionally rare, as the intrusion of foreign mammals like rabbits, pigs and goats had caused massive ecological disruption on the island. In fact, they gave the place its signature ochre hues, by destroying the vegetation that was holding the topsoil together. As you can see, erosion ensued.

Thankfully, these invasive species have since been eradicated, and Phillip Island is healing. Plant cover is returning, so lizards and birds are returning, so the centipedes are returning. Given that we’ve only formally known about these creatures for 37 years, I suspect that we still have much to learn about their biology and habits. I eagerly await any breakthroughs or discoveries.

In a world where it can seem like mammals dominate the planet, it’s nice to know that there’s a remote island out there somewhere where a giant bird-eating centipede rules the roost.

Well folks, this one was a little on the short side, mainly due to the fact that there just isn’t that much we know about the Phillip Island centipede… for now. Regardless, I hope you enjoyed the answer. Have a great day.
