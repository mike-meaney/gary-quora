# FISH

## 46. Death by Gluttony in the Deep Sea

A strong contender, in my view, would be the black swallower.

Relative to its overall size, this grotesque fish has the largest stomach of any animal. It lives as many as 2.7 kilometres below the ocean surface, and at those kinds of barren depths food is very hard to come by.

Because of this, if you happen to catch a meal, then you’d better not waste any of it. To solve this problem, the black swallower evolved a bizarre, elastic stomach which can swell to many times its original size. You can’t get full if your belly is unfillable, after all.

The feeding feats which this fish can achieve are mind-blowing. It’s able to swallow fish ten times its size whole! Of course, having a big stomach is no use if you can’t get your prey in there in the first place. We still don’t know how exactly the swallower swallows, but the prevailing theory is that it “walks” its jaws over the fish, tail-first.

That’s not to say that it doesn’t sometimes bite off more than it can chew. This black swallower below was fished up off the Cayman Islands in 2007. It tried to gobble up an 86 centimetre long snake mackerel; a meal nearly five times its own length! The huge mackerel ruptured the swallower’s stomach, killing it.

In other instances, the oversized meal will start decomposing before the swallower has finished digesting it. This releases gases, effectively turning the stomach into a balloon which buoys the fish up to the surface. Due to the pressure change, this too results in excruciating death.

This process is actually how most black swallower specimens come to be found by humans. As they live so deep beneath the waves, much about their lifestyle is shrouded in mystery.

The moral of the story: if you overeat, the lunch rotting in your stomach will produce buoyant gases and you’ll float up to the stratosphere and die.
