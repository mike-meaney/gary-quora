## 59. Beat the Heat With an Indestructible Ant

I did promise you guys that I’d write a full answer on Saharan silver ants, and it appears one of my readers has gone to the trouble of asking me the question for it!

These ants are truly remarkable creatures, easily one of the most interesting species in an already fascinating group. They can be found all across the more northern swathe of the Sahara Desert, a truly extreme habitat which has forced them to undergo some equally extreme adaptations. Here is why they are so unique.

Living out in the deserts, these insects are faced with a problem. All through the night and for most of the day, predators like lizards run amok. This leaves only a daily ten minute window in which they can emerge from their nest and look for food. There’s only one drawback - the reason there are no predators about during this window is because it’s midday, when the heat is absolutely blistering.

But the tough little critters are up to the challenge. They can withstand up to 53.6 degrees Celsius (128 Fahrenheit) by producing incredible molecules called heat shock proteins, which help maintain cell structure during extreme temperatures.

All living things use heat shock proteins, but the ants are the only organisms in the world which can manufacture them at will, before they surface, instead of as an automated response to heat after the fact.

Another way that Saharan silver ants resist the beating sun is with their signature coat of silvery hair. They are not cylindrical in shape, like most animals’ hairs, but rather they are triangular prisms. This structure makes them highly reflective; in fact, they reflect away over 90% of the light which hits them. This is why they look so shiny, of course.

In order to gather enough food to feed an entire colony for a day in just ten minutes, they have to be quick - very, very quick. In fact, relative to their size, Saharan silver ants are the third-fastest organisms on the planet, topped only by a species of tiger beetle and a [Californian mite](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-animal-faster-than-a-cheetah/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com").

They can cover a full metre in a little over a second, which is over 100 times their body length! Very interestingly, they run with their front legs lifted off the ground (perhaps to increase speed, or reduce contact with the searing-hot earth), making them one of the very few quadrupedal invertebrates.

So, have I convinced you that they’re special? You could make a strong case for ants as the most fascinating of all the insect groups, and Saharan silver ants are part of the reason why. Thank you for reading everyone, I hope you enjoyed this answer, and have a great day.
