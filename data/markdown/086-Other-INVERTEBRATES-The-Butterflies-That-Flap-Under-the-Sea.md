## 86. The Butterflies That Flap Under the Sea

Depending on your idea of what is and isn’t a wing, I have a candidate which might well qualify. I’m talking about the pteropods, a group of sea snails and sea slugs which swim using “wings”. There are two main groups of pteropods - those with shells, and those without.

Pteropods with shells are known as sea butterflies, or thecosomes. There are nine known families of sea butterflies, with many species distributed across the world’s oceans. What was once the foot has evolved into a pair of wing-shaped lobes, which are used to swim through the water in slow, flapping motions.

Because of their unique method of locomotion, sea butterflies spend their whole lives upside down. Most are less than a centimetre in length, and live as plankton. “Flying” is tough work when compared to the slow lugging that most snails do, so to cut down on weight, most thecosome shells are so thin that they’re transparent, which makes them hard to detect.

Sea butterflies also have a very interesting method of feeding. They are herbivores, feeding on microscopic phytoplankton much smaller even than themselves. To catch their food, they use a strategy known as mucous-meshing - essentially, they secrete an expanse of mucus, up to 5 centimetres across, which acts as a “net” to snag passing plankton.

Mucous-meshing is also used by other groups, such as pyrosomes (sea squirts which form elongated, translucent colonies and float about the deep). Anyway, that’s been the sea butterflies, now for the second group of pteropods.

The shelless pteropods, however, belong to a different group - the sea angels, or gymnosomes. Like their snail cousins, their foot has become a pair of wings used for locomotion. In addition to lacking a shell, they are generally larger than sea butterflies - the largest species, pictured above, measures 5 centimetres in length. This is because it lives in cold polar waters.

Sea angels can be twice as fast as thecosomes, and indeed many species feed exclusively on sea butterflies. Some of them, such as the one pictured below, have a ring of squid-like tentacles around their mouth, used to grab their victims. They even have suckers on the inner side.

The last species I’ll mention is Clione antarctica, found in the Southern Ocean. This sea angel is also a predator of sea butterflies, although it can go for months without food due to a large reserve of lipids it stores in its body. However, what’s most interesting about this species, I find, is its chemical defense.

It manufactures a unique compound called pteroenone, which deters predatory fish. There is then a species of amphipod - Hyperiella dilatata \- which “kidnaps” C. antarctica and carries them around for protection. The crustacean with its gelatinous bodyguard is shown below.

So, that’s pretty much everything you need to know about the tiny, delicate sea butterflies, and the diverse, predatory sea angels. What first strikes one about them is their wings, but when you look closer there are so many other fascinating details about them to find out.
