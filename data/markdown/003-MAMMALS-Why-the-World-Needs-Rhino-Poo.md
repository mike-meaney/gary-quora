## 3. Why the World Needs Rhino Poo
    
In Sub-Saharan Africa, rhinoceroses are what’s called keystone species - they are vital for upholding the local ecosystem. In truth, all species are ecologically important, as the removal of one causes change, and for life, change is almost always bad. However, a keystone species is one which stands out as playing a pivotal role.

ALl grassland habitats, the African savanna included, are fundamentally lacking in nutrients, at least in the soil. That’s one of the reasons why they don’t subside to denser woodland or forest. Some animals, like wildebeest, are happy to eat the long, nutrient-poor grass, and rely on their powerful digestive systems to process the vegetation.

In contrast, other animals like gazelles eat “sweet grass”, the most nutrient-rich of savannah grasses. In order for any viable concentration of sweet grass to exist in a certain place, there must be a reasonably dense nutrient content in the soil. One crucial way in which broken-down nutrients are recycled into into the ground is by, well, defecation - however, there is rarely much dung in one place.

However, rhinos are known for defecating in middens, predetermined sites where all dung is deposited. They can measure twenty metres across! Middens exist for the purpose of being regular, fixed stations where other rhinoceroses can gather information about their peers: the scent of each dropping betrays much about its producer. They also have the consequence of putting a lot of nutrients into the soil in one place - perfect for sweet grass.
