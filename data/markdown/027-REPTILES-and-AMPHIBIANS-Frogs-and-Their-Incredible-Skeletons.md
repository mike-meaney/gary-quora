## 27. Frogs and Their Incredible Skeletons

Surprisingly, I’d have to go with frogs. They might seem boring at a glance, but frogs are one of the weirdest land vertebrate groups there are - thanks in part to their insane reproductive biology, but also due to their skeletons.

First of all, there’s the fact that their skeletons have been drastically “simplified”. Most of the components of the skull have fused together into a single structure called the frontoparietal, and the spine may contain as little as five vertebrae. No species has more than nine.

Frogs have also discarded all the teeth on the lower jaw - except for one species, actually. Incredibly, Guenther’s marsupial frog from South America seems to have completely re-evolved lower teeth, unlike any other frog. Also, females have an egg pouch on their back, hence “marsupial”:

A different, related species of marsupial frog is pictured above, but it’s the same concept. Oh yeah, their eggs are also the largest of any amphibians, and the babies skip the tadpole phase. Didn’t I tell you frogs were really weird?

Alas, I’m getting sidetracked - back to the skeleton. The ribs of frogs have been reduced to stubs, called “transverse processes”, or have disappeared altogether in some species. One hypothesis is that this is due to the way they move - by hopping on their belly. Repeatedly landing on their ribs would be damaging to the bones.

So, because their ribs are so tiny, frogs can’t breathe by expanding and contracting the chest, like other vertebrates. Instead, they respire by pumping their throats, as the inside of their mouth is lined with capillary blood vessels for gas exchange. They also breathe partially through their skin.

Other examples of the frog skeleton being “simplified” include the forelegs and shoulder girdle, which are each fused amalgamations of smaller bones. The pelvis bone is also really, really weird; it has this bizarre trident shape, and it’s longer than the entire spine!

Another really odd thing is that that stick of bone in the middle of the “trident”, the urostyle, is actually what’s left of a tail. Based on studies of embryos, the tail vertebrae of frogs’ ancestors have slowly retracted and been absorbed into the bony sheath of the spine.

Lastly, I’ll talk about the hands and feet. Each frog forelimb has four digits, but in the males of many species, there appears to be five. This fifth “toe” is a mysterious, spike-like structure called the prepollex, or pseudothumb. It’s usually used either in combat or to grip females during mating.

Also, you can’t mention froggy toes without giving the hairy frog a shoutout. Nicknamed the Wolverine frog, this unique species from the rainforests of Central Africa is famous for its amazing defense mechanism.

When threatened, the hairy frog can snap its toe bones at will. The jagged shards jut out through the skin, and can be used to maim attackers. Of course, the species is even more well-known for its “hair”; filaments of skin, or dermal papillae, which sprout along the flanks of males during the breeding season.

Alas, I’d better finish up now before I find myself fallen into another info-dump rabbit hole - or should I say ribbit hole? In fact, writing that painful joke made me want to go on another tangent about how only one species of frog (the Pacific tree frog) actually says “ribbit” and it became the stereotypical frog noise because that species lives near Hollywood, California.

See what I mean? Anyway, thanks everyone for reading. I hope you aren’t too bored by me talking at length about the bones of amphibians. Have a great day!
