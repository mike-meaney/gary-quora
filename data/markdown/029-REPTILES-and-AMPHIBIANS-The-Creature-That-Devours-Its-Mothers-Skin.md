## 29. The Creature That Devours Its Mother's Skin

There are a handful of possible answers to this question, but for me, the answer is clear: caecilians. Most people have heard of two of the main amphibian groups: the anurans (frogs) and the caudates (salamanders). However, unbeknownst to many, there is a third - and extremely bizarre - group, known as the caecilians.

They’ve popped up in my answers a few time before, but I’ve never written about them in as much detail as they deserve; a predicament which I intend to remedy today.

The nearly 200 species of caecilian are distributed across most of the world’s tropical rainforests. Their most obvious stand-out feature is, of course, the complete absence of legs - they have an almost earthworm-like appearance. That said, some species can get quite a lot bigger than your typical worm - one specimen was measured to be two metres in length!

All along this length are folds of skin called annuli, another conspicuous hallmark. Though this skin may appear soft and squishy, it hides an embedded armour of subcutaneous scales, which are made of calcite. The skin also has another line of defense: toxic secretions. These can be highly effective - touching the secretions of one species, Boettger’s caecilian, is known to induce severe hemolysis (rupturing of red blood cells).

Continuing this dermal theme, I am obligated to mention a fascinating behaviour seen in a select handful of caecilian species: maternal dermatophagy, or skin-feeding. When they have newborn young, these animals grow a new, fatty layer of skin, around their existing body.

The babies then start gnawing away at this exceptionally nutritious source of food, which is regenerated every few days. The whole skin-feeding process lasts about a week, during which time the caecilian’s offspring increase tenfold in size. It may seem grotesque, but it’s a pretty comparable survival strategy to lactation in mammals.

What’s more, those aren’t the only weird caecilian babies. Some members of the family Typhlonectidae are born with a huge set, or sets, of frilly gills sprouting out of their head. Stranger still, the larvae shed them almost instantly after birth, breathing instead with their skin.

The typhlonectids are a very interesting family for many other reasons. Unlike most of their relatives, which are burrowing creatures, they are aquatic, and many species are entirely restricted to their underwater habitat. They have a long, paddle-like fin running along their tail which allows them to swim in an undulating, eel-like manner.

The most famous of the typhlonectids is probably Atretochoana eiselti, which is notorious for its rather… well… unusual resemblance to something else. What it ought to be known for, on the other hand, is the fact that it it doesn’t have any lungs!

It’s unique among caecilians in this regard, and is also the world’s largest lungless tetrapod by an enormous margin. Its skin is packed to the rafters with blood capillaries, allowing it to breathe and sustain such impressive mass without any complex organ systems.

While Atretochoana and its relatives sport very dull, greyish, brownish or purplish hues, it’s worth noting that other caecilians are a lot more vibrant and colourful. They can be bright yellow:

Orange:

Or electric blue:

These palettes are likely an example of aposematism: bright colours which advertise to would-be predators that the animal is poisonous, venomous, unpalatable, spiny or otherwise undesirable. They are not - as far as we know - a sexual display feature meant for other caecilians, because these creatures are practically blind.

Caecilian eyes are quite primitive, capable only of distinguishing between light and dark, not of forming images. They are burrowing animals, after all, and good vision is not much of an advantage for this lifestyle. Hence, the eyes are tiny, sometimes even completely covered by skin.

That being said, caecilians have other, much more acute sensory organs - the most bizarre of which being their tentacles. Yes, just behind the nostrils, they have a pair of minuscule tendrils, only perceptible if you look closely. Their precise mechanism is not really known, but it’s reasonable to assume that they are used to smell things, perhaps augmenting the regular olfactory system.

The tentacle in the photo below is that pale, tooth-like projection, if you’re having trouble spotting it.

Below the tentacles is, of course, the mouth, which has plenty of weird stuff going on. Caecilian teeth are translucent, frighteningly sharp, and often arranged in multiple rows, adapted for chomping through their earthworm prey. Furthermore, there is a species - the ringed caecilian - has a set of glands in its dentition which may in fact secret venom! This would make it the world’s only known venomous amphibian.

What’s even more interesting to me than their teeth, however, is how they bite with them. The musculature surrounding the caecilian jaw is extraordinarily complex, containing muscles which have not been found in any other organism on Earth. This is because, unlike all other vertebrate species, they have two separate systems of muscles used for closing the jaw.

In addition to the normal set of jaw muscles, which simply contract to pull the mandible bone upwards, they have a second array which push down on the posterior section of the bone, causing the front part to lift up in a seesaw-like motion. It’s one of those biological quirks which probably doesn’t interest the average person but is fascinating to people like me.

In case you’re wondering, this intricate feature is an adaptation which allows caecilians to bite with greater force, especially in a gaping position in which the jaw muscles would otherwise be at much less of a mechanical advantage.

Now, I finally have an answer which does this wonderfully peculiar group of amphibians justice. Thank you very much everyone for reading; I hope you found some of this interesting, and that you all have a great day.
