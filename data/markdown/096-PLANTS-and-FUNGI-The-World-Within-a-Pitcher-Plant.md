This is a painfully difficult question to answer, as basically all carnivorous plants are fascinating. However, if I had to choose, there’s one group which stands out to me as the most interesting of all, and for that reason, it’s my favourite. The group in question is the genus Nepenthes, otherwise known as the Old World pitcher plants.

I’m sure many of you have heard of pitcher plants - they are living pitfall traps, which drown unsuspecting insects in a pool of digestive fluid. What you may not know is that the name does not refer to a single type of flora; it’s more of an umbrella term applied to a handful of independent groups which have evolved the same basic survival strategy. In Southeast Asia, Nepenthes is the dominant brand of pitcher.

As you can see, the leaves are tubular in shape, with a wide opening and a lid on top. The plants’ glamorous colours and sweet scent of nectar entice flies into landing on the opening’s ribbed lip, which is known as the peristome. However, unbeknownst to the insects, the peristome is coated in a waxy substance, causing them to slip and plunge into the chamber.

The fluid at the bottom can be either watery or jelly-like in consistency. Its composition ensures that it is both viscous and elastic, a ruthless combination that makes escape a near impossibility for the prey. It also contains a cocktail of digestive enzymes for making short work of all victims, and anti-microbial proteins that prevent the liquid from being contaminated with bacteria or fungi.

Most of the time, only invertebrates fall prey to Nepenthes plants - flies, spiders, scorpions, centipedes, snails and the like. There are certainly exceptions though - the larger species can even drown frogs, lizards, birds and rats.

There’s also one species, Nepenthes albomarginata, which feeds only on termites. It’s the world’s only carnivorous plant that specializes in a single food source, and also probably the only one which offers up its own flesh as bait. Around the top of each its pitchers is a ring of furry white hairs, or trichomes. Seemingly, termites love to graze on these, but often fall into the pit in so doing.

All that said, the most fascinating thing about the Old World pitcher plants is not how they capture their prey, but their relationships with other, non-prey animals. Each Nepenthes basically contains its own miniature ecosystem, a microcosm of the surrounding rainforest. The shockingly diverse assembly of little critters which inhabit these plants are collectively known as Nepenthes infauna.

The infauna can be further divided into three tiers; nepenthebionts, nepenthephiles and nepenthexenes. The first category, the nepenthebionts, are highly specialized, such that part of their life cycle is entirely dependent on the pitcher plants. Many species of mosquitoes spend their larval stage in Nepenthes fluid - look closely at any pitcher and you might see shoals of worm-like mosquito larvae swimming about.

An even more interesting nepenthebiont is the diving ant, Colobopsis schmitzi. It has a symbiotic relationship with the fanged pitcher plant of Borneo. This plant lacks waxy surfaces, and its fluid is much less potent at digestion. How then does it catch prey? As it turns out, most of the fanged pitcher plant’s diet constitutes the droppings of the ants which inhabit it.

These ants get their name from how they dive into the pitcher’s pool of liquid - they can swim and hold their breath for 30 seconds. Since the fluid is lacking in acid and enzymes, the Nepenthes cannot digest many animals which fall in, and the products of their decomposition can even prove fatal for the plants. The ants, however, are more than up to the task, so they haul fallen flies out and devour them.

The host plant, in turn, can easily process the ants’ feces, so it doesn’t lose out. In addition to a stable food source, the pitcher provides diving ants with a home; its tendrils are hollow, with tunnel space for the insects to build a thriving colony.

The other two categories are the nepenthophiles and nepenthoxenes. The former are not dependent on pitcher plants for survival, but almost invariably live inside them. The latter are the animals who occasionally frequent Nepenthes plants, but only do so opportunistically - usually represented by scuttle flies and hoverflies feeding on the putrefying carrion within the fluid.

The full diversity of Nepenthes infauna is too vast and, unfortunately, too poorly studied to detail in a single answer. There are filter-feeding larvae, tiny crustaceans, swimming predators, predatory spiders, creatures which drink the fluid itself… each pitcher is like a tiny ocean. And the infauna is not limited to teeny weeny life. Meet, for example, Geosesarma malayanum.

Yes, a crab! Unlike the diving ants, it’s not a symbiont, but rather a parasite of sorts. It makes a living by plundering the pitcher Nepenthes ampullaria, nabbing any drowning critters it comes across. However, it ought to be careful, as sometimes crabs can slip and themselves fall prey to the pitcher!

If you thought that was cool, know that there are even bigger, more unexpected nepenthephiles. Look closely at a Nepenthes lowii and you might notice something unusual about it. The underside of its lid is coated in a kind of beaded white gel. This secretion reportedly has a sugary taste (yes, a naturalist ate it to find out) and for quite some time, its function was a mystery.

In 2009, the pieces started coming together, and we began to realize that N. lowii was the world’s only vegetarian carnivorous plant. The sugary beads attract tree shrews, which lick them up, and defecate almost immediately. The shrews’ excrement is a nutrient-rich source of food for the pitcher, which serves as a replacement for insects and other animal prey.

Other Nepenthes species employ even more extreme means of getting their fix of mammalian droppings. N. hemsleyana of Borneo has an elongated form, of the perfect size and shape to house a Hardwicke’s woolly bat! These bats commonly roost inside the pitchers, where they are safe from parasites and the elements. Of course, they also defecate in them, providing the plant with food.

Likewise, Hardwicke’s woolly bats seem to be adapted for roosting in Nepenthes. The clicking noises they make to echolocate have the highest frequency of any bat - perhaps an adaptation to pinpoint the small and easily-missed plants. The pitchers also have a curved, parabolic structure above their entrances, which reflects sounds well and may further help them be located.

So, do you now understand why the Old World pitcher plants are my favourite of all the planet’s carnivorous flora? After all, they allow me to write about half a dozen different animals while still writing about one type of plant - a welcome bonus. I hope you all enjoyed this answer and found it interesting. Thanks for reading, and have a great day!
