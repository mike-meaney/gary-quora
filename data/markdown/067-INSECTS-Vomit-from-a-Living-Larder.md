## 67. Vomit from a Living Larder

Most mature insects have a hard, chitinous exoskeleton which prevents the body from expanding. In order to grow, arthropods have to shed this skeleton and grow a new, larger one. This process is known as ecdysis.

As such, when they enter a caloric surplus, they don’t really get “fatter”, they just get… denser. Insects store fat as droplets of lipids encased inside the cells of a special organ called the “fat body”. These lipids get packed in more tightly as fat is gained.

However, something along the lines of visible fattening can happen to underdeveloped insects, whose exoskeletons aren’t yet so inflexible. Larvae like grubs, maggots and the like put on fat pretty quickly, and can actually enter a diabetes-like condition when this happens in excess.

As a stomach-churning side note, scientists have extracted larval fat and experimented with it as a possible substitute for dairy butter. Apparently, an unpleasant taste was only noticed by test subjects when about 50% of the butter in a cake was replaced by the insect fat.

There are also certain insects which look engorged, “obese” even, but not due to body fat per se. Somehow, I’ve never written about honeypot ants in all my three years on Quora, but today is a good opportunity to remedy that.

Honeypot ants have a special caste of workers called repletes. These living larders are fed on pollen and nectar until their abdomens distend to spherical proportions. During lean times, the other workers tickle the swollen repletes’ antennae, causing them to vomit up the digested food - delicious.

Since I’ve already ruined your appetites with the larval cake tidbit, I might as well go ahead and say that people eat these insects too. The repletes are a common delicacy for some indigenous Australian groups; while most ants taste quite citrusy due to their formic acid, honeypot ants are very sweet, thanks to the nectar within.

So, in short: when most insects put on fat, they don’t change outwardly, they just pack it on more densely. However, larvae with less rigid exoskeletons can get visibly fatter, and other insects do swell up due to food itself rather than stored fat. Thanks for reading, everyone!
