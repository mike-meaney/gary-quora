## 5. Nature Blossoms After Nuclear Meltdown
    
On April 26, 1986, something happened in Pripryat, Ukraine that would go down as one of the most infamous industrial catastrophes in history - the Chernobyl Disaster. The meltdown of a nuclear reactor core triggered devastating explosions and the release of a massive cloud of radiation.

The current wildlife situation around Chernobyl is something of a controversy in science. Some biologists argue that "wildlife in the zone shows a strong pattern of declining abundance", but many other scientists have found that the local fauna is clearly on the rise. Evidence points towards them being correct.

Various camera trapping operations have revealed that the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has grown a healthy population of large mammals, such as grey wolves, European badgers, wild boar, roe deer, and even moose. There are also abundant smaller mammals, including Eurasian beavers, least weasels and voles. Among the birds, there are quite a few flashy species, such as the enormous white-tailed sea eagle (Europe’s largest raptor) and black storks.

And that’s just the native wildlife. Since the disaster, people have released other Eurasian mammals into this involuntary oasis, including European bison and wild Przewalski’s horses. There’s even evidence that animals not seen in the region for over a century are returning, like Eurasian lynx, and brown bears.

It’s pretty amazing, and also rather sobering, to think that the sheer presence of humans was worse for the environment than a catastrophic nuclear disaster.
