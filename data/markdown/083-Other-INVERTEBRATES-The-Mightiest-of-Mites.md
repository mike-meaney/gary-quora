## 83. The Mightiest of Mites

I’ve written about a lot of super-obscure and seemingly drab animals before, but you could still be forgiven for assuming that I couldn’t think of a single remotely interesting type of mite. And you’d be right. I can think of five.

* * *

First, Adactylidium. If you thought its name was a mouthful, just wait for some of the creepy crawlies you’ll see coming up next! Biologists were initially perplexed when they studied the males of this species - after being born, they would not feed or mate, and die within hours. How could they possibly reproduce?

Believe it or not, their reproduction occurs before birth! Adactylidium females have one male offspring and at least five females in their “womb”. Inside his mother’s body, the male impregnates the unborn siblings, who then kill their mother from the inside out and crawl their way to the outside world, carrying young of their own.

So, their only purpose in life is to be incestuous and matricidal - a sad existence…

Next up, the South California mite. Relative to its size, this little arachnid is the fastest animal on the planet, by far. It’s less than a millimetre long, and dashes at speeds of around 0.8 km/h. That might not sound like much, but it means it can run 322 times its own body length in a single second! For comparison, a cheetah sprints at up to 16 body lengths per second.

If humans were that fast (proportionally), we could run at over 2,000 km per hour, nearly as fast as the top speeds of some fighter jets. Of course, small size is part of why the South California mite is so speedy - they have fewer cells than a large animal, and thus they produce less excess heat when moving at high velocity.

Thirdly, we have not just one species but a whole family of mites - the halarachnids. That being said there are only ten species in the family, which is tiny by arthropod standards. They are still super interesting though! Halarachnids are unique among mites in that they inhabit the oceans - but not in the way you’d think.

They live solely inside the nasal cavities of seals, sea lions, fur seals, walruses and otters, as parasites. In large numbers they can give the host severe respiratory ailments like pulmonary emphysema. And it gets worse - there has been one documented transmission to a human. He was sneezed on by a walrus while visiting SeaWorld!

Our next mighty mite is Macrocheles rettenmeyeri. Try saying that three times fast. This one is technically a parasite of army ants, but studies show that it may actually improve the life of its hosts. When it finds an ant, it will chew off one of the insect’s feet, and begin sucking its haemolymph (blood, basically).

That doesn’t sound very life-improving, does it? Well, Macrocheles latches on in place of the foot, and itself becomes a fully functioning foot. And research has suggested that the performance of the leg is improved with a mite-foot. So, this “parasite” is essentially a living, breathing prosthesis for ants.

Last, but certainly not least, we come to another catchy name - Osperalycus tenerphagus. You might expect that a creature as bizarre and wacky as this would be discovered in a remote jungle, but it was found on the grounds of Ohio State University, in 2014. The first thing you’d notice about it is its long, serpentine form - it’s built more like a worm than an arachnid.

Things get really weird, however, when you look closer. Its body is covered in rings, which in turn are marked by tiny paddle-like structures. Using muscle under its skin, it contracts these rings, then expands them using hydraulic pressure. This rhythm of contraction and expansion allows them to glide through sand and soil.

There are plenty of locomotive strategies animals use to get around, but this has to be one of the most alien.

So, these microscopic mites probably aren’t the most glamorous or charismatic animals I’ve ever written about, but I hope you too can see the novelty and curious beauty in the small and strange.

From super-speed and prenatal procreation to ant-amputating and a pintsize Shai-Hulud, there’s plenty of fascinating adaptations these crawlies have to offer. Thank you very much for reading! Have a great day.
