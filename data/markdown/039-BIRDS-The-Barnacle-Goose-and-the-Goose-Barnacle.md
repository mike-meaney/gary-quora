## 39. The Barnacle Goose and the Goose Barnacle

Excellent question! The answer - spontaneous generation.

Spontaneous generation was first thought up in deep ancient times, likely originating in Greece in the 6th Century BC, and it persisted until the 1800s. Essentially, it was the idea that many organisms are born not from other organisms, but from nonliving matter.

Eels were said to come from riverbed mud, maggots from rotting flesh, scallops from sand and so on. Essentially, this was early philosophers’ and scientists’ way of explaining births which they had never, and could not have, observed. There is at least one instance of this being used to explain the origin of a migratory bird.

Above is a species of waterfowl called the barnacle goose, which is found chiefly in Europe and North America. As you’ll come to see, it isn’t named after barnacles, the crustaceans - rather, it’s the other way around.

Every summer, barnacle geese migrate to the Arctic to breed. As the far north was inaccessible and inhospitable to Medieval Europeans, in their eyes the birds simply disappeared for 6 months every year. So, they invoked spontaneous generation to explain how baby barnacle geese are made.

One popular belief was that they came from driftwood:

> They are produced from fir timber tossed along the sea, and are at first like gum. Afterwards they hang down by their beaks as if they were a seaweed attached to the timber, and are surrounded by shells in order to grow more freely. Having thus in process of time been clothed with a strong coat of feathers, they either fall into the water or fly freely away into the air.

The above was written by a Medieval Welsh author, Giraldus Cambrensis, who documented the natural history of Ireland. Read further in his account and it becomes clear what these “baby birds” really were:

> They derived their food and growth from the sap of the wood or from the sea, by a secret and most wonderful process of alimentation. I have frequently seen, with my own eyes, more than a thousand of these small bodies of birds, hanging down on the sea-shore from one piece of timber, enclosed in their shells, and already formed. They do not breed and lay eggs like other birds, nor do they ever hatch any eggs, nor do they seem to build nests in any corner of the earth.

Yes, Cambrensis is in fact talking about barnacles, which get their name from this belief. Unsurprisingly, it’s also why members of the order Pedunculata (a subset of the barnacles) are known as goose barnacles. To be fair, goose barnacles do have rather goose-like “necks” and “beaks”.

Now, the idea that these geese were grown-up barnacles had some unexpected implications, especially when it comes to food laws.

Here in Ireland, many priests sneakily argued that barnacle geese could therefore be eaten during Lent and other fast days, as actual barnacles were allowed. Some Christians criticized this, however, and eventually Pope Innocent III established that barnacle geese could not be eaten during Lent.

So, long story short - they believed that migratory birds were born as goose barnacles which spawned from driftwood or trees.
