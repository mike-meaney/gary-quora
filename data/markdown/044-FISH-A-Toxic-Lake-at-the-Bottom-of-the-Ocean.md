## A Toxic Lake at the Bottom of the Ocean

If you pour oil into a glass of water, the oil will, of course, float to the top - because it’s less dense. It’s almost like there’s a lake of water in the oil. So, if you had a fluid much denser than sea water, a similar principle could allow for a “lake” to form under the sea.

As it happens, such situations certainly do occur in the natural world. When deep-sea deposits of salt dissolve into the water, the result is an extremely saline “brine” which is significantly denser than normal seawater. It gathers in pools at the ocean’s floor, like this:

Here’s a good diagram to help explain:

I should note, these can also occur off the Antarctic coast due to salt becoming more concentrated in the remaining water during the formation of ice.

The dense brine acts in an eerily similar way underwater to water in air. There’s a clear surface and shoreline, and it ripples and forms waves on contact. Additionally, much of the time it’s very rich in methane, which has an interesting effect on the ecosystem.

Many bacteria are methanotrophs - in simple terms, they “eat” methane. Furthermore, some of these have formed a close relationship with certain species of mussels, by setting up shop inside the molluscs’ gills. They feed on methane and the mussels feed on the waste products they produce.

Because of this, you will often see a “beach” of mussels surrounding the lake of brine, filtering the methane from the water for their bacterial symbiotes. To make matters more interesting, there is a species of bacteria-eating snail which has the mysterious ability to detect the water the mussels alter, and seeks them out.

However, brine pools aren’t always beneficial for organisms. Their water is so incredibly saline - up to ten times that above the surface - and can also contain toxic chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide. Because of this, many marine creatures that chance a dive into one of the pools don’t come back out.
