## 89. Fifty Webs of Grey

One of the most fascinating spiders in the world (and that’s saying something) is Darwin’s bark spider, which lives in the humid forests of eastern Madagascar. It wasn’t discovered by Charles Darwin (in fact, it was only found in 2009), but was described on the 150th anniversary of the publication of Origin, hence the name.

The species is most well-known for the amazing webs it builds. They are the largest orb webs in the world, with total surface areas of up to 2.8 square metres, and span entire rivers, some up to 25 metres wide. Their exceptional size allows them to catch dozens of river insects at a time, especially mayflies.

These giant webs are made of no ordinary material. The silk of a Darwin’s bark spider is the toughest biological material known to man, by a factor of two. It can have a tensile toughness of up to 520 Joules per cubic metre, making it ten times stronger than Kevlar (by area).

But we’re not here to talk about the web of this spider. Equally bizarre and fascinating is its mating habits. They feature many behaviours associated, on their own, with other species of spider, but is the only species with a repertoire of so many. Darwin’s bark spider mating goes something like this:

*   The male approaches a female, which will be at least three times his size. She could well eat him once she’s had enough, so males usually prefer females which have just molted. Their exoskeleton will still be soft and leathery, so they won’t be as agile. This way, the male is more likely to survive the encounter.
*   The male ties the female up in his silk. (I know what you’re thinking… stop thinking it.) This is a further countermeasure to decrease his chances of being devoured. In such a small quantity, however, the silk is more of a hindrance to the female spider than a fail-safe straitjacket. His survival is not yet assured.

*   In yet another preventative measure, occasionally the male will… well, salivate on the female’s epigyne - her reproductive parts. Using his palps (a pair of fang-like organs near the mouth), he secretes salival fluid onto her epigyne, lubricating it. Jokes aside, this seems to have a calming effect on the female, making her less aggressive.
*   Copulation occurs, with sperm transferred via the palps. But, in about half of observed cases, the palps will then break off and remain inside the female. The purpose of this? The severed reproductive organs now plug the female’s epigyne, preventing the male’s competitors from passing on their genes.

*   After mating, the male does something quite surprising. If his palps have not already detached in the female, he chews them off himself! By self-castrating, he causes a hormonal change which makes him much more aggressive. Now, he is better equipped to fight off rival males and protect his bloodline.

As you can see, the Darwin’s bark spider has a damn weird sex life. Some of you might have read my last answer - [Gary Meaney's answer to Which one is the coolest or most interesting island of the world, and why?](https://www.quora.com/Which-one-is-the-coolest-or-most-interesting-island-of-the-world-and-why/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") - where I had a short dossier on the species. I mainly focused on the web and silk there, saying that the mating habits were “a story for another day”. That day is today.
