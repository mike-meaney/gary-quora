## 42. The Most Counter-Intuitive Dance Routine

The blue-backed manakin has a fascinating, and indeed counter-intuitive, courtship ritual. In almost all animals, when the male tries to impress the female, he does so competitively. Blue-backed manakins, on the other hand, do this cooperatively.

Several males, which are blue and black with a bright red cap, line up on a twig in view of a female. They then perform a dance together, with one on the far side hopping up, and then fluttering to the back of the line. They all take turns in this way.

The result is a courtship display much more impressive than one which is performed solo, but the question remains - since only one will get to mate, why do the others cooperate? At the end of the day, it could be any of them who the female selects, so by teaming up they increase everybody’s chances.

Sometimes, it’s better to work together - even with your fiercest competitors.
