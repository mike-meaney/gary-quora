## 66. Turtle Ants, Toad Bugs and Owl Flies

I can’t seem to stop answering these types of questions, but they are pretty fun and usually well-received, so let’s give it another go.

Owlflies

Ever heard of a [wobbegong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobbegong "en.wikipedia.org") shark? Well, imagine that, but on land, plus enormous mandibles wider than the body. That’s a fair description of an owlfly larva. What’s super cool about them is that some species actually cement sand and debris into their exoskeleton to serve as camouflage, kind of like a tank might with foliage and bushes.

The adults resemble dragonflies in many respects, with the most noticeable difference being their huge, club-tipped antennae, used for balance in flight. Some owlflies actually mimic wasps in their adult morph, like many other insects.

Fairyflies

This is an insect - an insect the size of a protozoa, that is. I’m not kidding - these wasps are the most diminutive insects in the world, with the smallest weighing in at 0.0000025 grams, and being about 0.1 millimetres long.

At such a small size, flying is nothing like we could ever imagine. The viscosity of the air makes it soupy, so the smaller fairyflies have to practically swim through the air - hence the bizarre, paddle-shaped wings pictured above.

Pennella

Copepods are a type of planktonic crustacean, and they’re usually microscopic. Pennella is a definite exception - in fact, some have been recorded at roughly 1 foot in length! The females cling to the skin of fish and squid as blood-sucking parasites.

The largest species - P. balaenopterae - even infects whales. Several cetaceans have been found covered in the repulsive copepods, which create nasty welts as they burrow deep into their host’s blubber.

Hangingflies

This is what you get when you cross a fly, a spider and a monkey. Using their long, spindly forelimbs, they simply hang from blades of grass all day, using their huge legs to snatch insects which fly past. They’re so specialized for hanging and grabbing that most species can barely walk.

Some hangingflies have an interesting mating ritual where the male presents the female with a captured prey item. If she judges the catch to be of sufficient quality, the male will get to mate with her.

Toad bugs

The name is pretty accurate here, given that these insects are warty, squat amphibious animals which have bulging eyes, eat flies, and move by hopping. Found in riverine environments, they are capable swimmers and usually prefer very moist locations.

One especially interesting species of toad bug is Gelastocoris oculatus. It is highly variable in terms of colour - in a single locale, you might find black ones, gray ones, mottled brown ones and even green-and-red ones.

Macrocheles rettenmeyeri

This one is criminally obscure for such an amazing creature. This mite will search for an army ant, and then bite off its foot so it can latch on instead, sucking the ant’s blood (or haemolymph, to be strictly accurate).

What’s really fascinating, though, is that the mite actually serves as a perfectly good foot, and one study suggested that it might even improve the performance of the leg. Besides that, very little is known about these creatures.

Turtle ants

This has got to be one of the coolest ants out there, and that’s saying something. Cephalotes soldiers have bizarre heads which are huge and flattened, looking almost like dishes. In the event of the colony being attacked, the soldiers use their massive heads to plug the nest’s entrances (that’s the round thing in the photo).

The strategy is apparently very effective. Commonly known as turtle ants, another cool fact about them is that, using their legs, they can perform a rudimentary form of gliding. Lastly…

Onychocerus albitarsis

Long-horned beetles are famous for their enormous antennae, which are usually longer than the body, and give them their name. Onychocerus albitarsis puts a cherry on top by having venomous stingers on the end of their antennae. As O. albitarsis is a herbivore, they likely have a solely defensive purpose.

It’s actually the only truly venomous beetle among 350,000 other described species, though some leak/spray toxins rather than actually injecting them. Thankfully, the stingers don’t pose a threat to humans, though they may cause “mild swelling”.

Those are 8 really obscure arthropod taxa which deserve a lot more love - hopefully this answer will earn them some more fans. There are of course many other species in this enormous phylum which I could have showcased - not to mention all the bizarre extinct groups - but I’ll leave it at these for now.
