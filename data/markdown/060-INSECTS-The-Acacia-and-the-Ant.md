## 60. The Acacia and the Ant

Acacia trees like defense mechanisms so much, they evolved a defense mechanism from a different defense mechanism.

Acacias are covered in thorns, which of course make them difficult for herbivores to eat. Although some animals, such as giraffes, have extra-long tongues and prehensile lips to negotiate the spikes, overall they’re quite effective.

However, many species in the Acacia genus have gone a step further, and evolved hollow passages - known as domatia - in their thorns. These tunnels are the perfect place for an ant colony to set up shop - and that’s exactly what the trees want.

While insignificant to us, in the insect worlds, ants are bad news. Using ridiculous numbers, as well as biting mandibles and formic acid secretions, to overwhelm virtually any target, many species of ant are, on an invertebrate scale, the ultimate predators.

So, when they colonize the thorns of the acacia trees, any tresspasser in the area will either be killed by the ants or driven away by them. This includes all the pesky herbivorous insects which gnaw away at the acacia leaves. Essentially, the ants become the tree’s own suite of security guards.

It’s not only the domatia that the plants offer to their six-legged tenants. Many species of acacia also have these little buds on the tip of each leaf. These are known as Beltian bodies (above) and are in fact high-protein snacks for the ants.

A handful of species, such as A. colinsii, also produce another form of ant food - extrafloral nectar. This sugary secretion is not - as nectar usually is - found in the flower, but instead simply secreted from the body of the plant. All in all, the ants get accomodation and free meals, and the trees get an army of defenders. Seems like a pretty good deal to me.
