## 2. The Mystery History of a Very Round Seal

On the vast plains of Siberia, one will find Lake Baikal. It's the last places you’d expect to see wild marine mammals. The nearest ocean water to the lake is the Sea of Okhotsk, with over 1,500 kilometres of dry land in between. Nevertheless, Lake Baikal is the haunt of the Baikal seal, the world’s only exclusively freshwater pinniped and the world's smallest pinniped.

Also known as nerpas, Baikal seals are usually between 1 and 1.4 metres long and weigh, at most, 70 kilograms. Thankfully, they’re classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, with about 100,000 individuals in their ranks. The primary food source of the nerpa is the golomyanka, a very strange species of fish found in the lake.

At the end of the day, we really don’t know for sure how Baikal seals got to Lake Baikal. Some speculate that their ancestors made their way there by way of the Paratethys - a huge inland sea that occupied a sizeable chunk of Eurasia during the Miocene, of which the Black, Caspian and Aral Seas may well be modern remnants.

The idea is that Miocene seals living in the Mediterranean would have come up through the Paratethys and then, over millennia, migrated up connective rivers and lakes all the way to Lake Baikal - giving rise to another seal species, the Caspian seal, along the way.

However, this hypothesis definitely has its flaws. The Baikal seal is well-adapted to frigid climes - for their size, they have the largest claws of any seal, a feature which allows them to scrape out breathing holes in the ice. It's doubtful that animals of Mediterranean origins would have such polar characteristics. They’re much more similar to the (usually) marine ringed seal of the Arctic Ocean.

Additionally, genetic studies show that Baikal seals are more closely related to ringed seals than Caspian seals. This would also throw the Paratethyan theory into question, as it maintains that both Baikal and Caspian seals are the result of the same inland migration. What’s more likely is that Baikal seals came from the Arctic.

Many animals in Lake Baikal are clearly related to animals of the Arctic ocean, such as the omul fish, which is an animal in the exclusively cold-water-dwelling genus *Coregonus*. This would also explain the Baikal seal’s adaptations to an icy environment.

But the question still remains - how did seals cross the 2,000 kilometers which lies between the Arctic Ocean and Baikal? Well, what we do know is that about 80,000 years ago, during the last Ice Age there was an enormous lake (twice the size of the Caspian Sea, the largest lake today) in West Siberia. It owed its existence to the Eurasian Ice Sheet, which dammed up and flooded rivers. The lake would have been connected to Lake Baikal by the Angara River.

That said, based on molecular evidence, we know that Baikal seals diverged (in an evolutionary sense) from other seals about four million years ago, long before this glacial lake existed. It seems very likely that they migrated from the Arctic ocean through Siberian lakes, but - for now, at least - we don’t know anything about the nature of said lakes.
