Perhaps. Chimpanzees in the Republic of Guinea habitually hurl rocks at special trees in the forest, the stones accumulating in “cairns”. Biologist Laura Kehoe, who first recorded the behavior using camera traps, hypothesizes that these could be “shrines” for the chimps and held sacred in some form of rudimentary religion.

Others say that this practice is just a form of communication, although the idea that only “special” trees are stoned is interesting and might seem to challenge this explanation.

Staying on the topic of chimpanzees, the famous primatologist Jane Goodall has observed another kind of uncannily religious-like behavior. In the Gombe, she’s seen her chimps performing ritual dances at the onset of the rains, or when they come across a waterfall. Here’s a video:

Goodall proposes that these displays could be an early, primitive form of “elemental worship”.

Now, elephants. According to Ronald K. Siegel, a psychopharmacologist who has studied elephant behavior extensively,

> "Elephants are aware of natural cycles, as they practice "moon worship," waving branches at the waxing moon and engaging in ritual bathing when the moon is full."

This isn’t all Siegel has to say on the matter. He’s also documented elephant funeral rituals, which are fairly well-known among animal fans, but he brings up some fascinating lesser-known points.

> When encountering dead animals, elephants will often bury them with mud, earth and leaves. Animals known to have been buried by elephants include rhinos, buffalos, cows, calves, and even humans, in addition to elephants themselves. Elephants have \[been\] observed burying their dead with large quantities of food fruit, flowers and colourful foliage."

The last part is especially revealing. Are these grave goods supplies for their dead friends in some proboscine afterlife, like the gold treasures of Egyptian pharaohs or hoards of Bronze Age kings? Perhaps.

One thing he doesn’t mention is that other herds of elephants have traditions of gathering all their dead into special places - elephant graveyards.

Besides elephants, there’s only one other animal I would say has proper funeral rites and not just elaborate mourning. Magpies, according to Dr Marc Bekoff, fashion “wreaths” of grass and lay them by their dead peers, and then stand vigil for a while. Similar behaviors are reported in ravens, but not scientifically documented.

Beyond that, chimps and dolphins guard their dead and, in the case of the former species, sit beside the corpse for hours in silence, but this might just be grief rather than a true funeral ritual.
