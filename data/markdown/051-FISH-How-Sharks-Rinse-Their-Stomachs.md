## 51. How Sharks Rinse Their Stomachs

Sharks. Everyone knows sharks - many love them, many fear them. However, they have a particular grotesque habit which few are aware of: gastric eversion.

Have a look at the photo above. Did you notice something in the shark’s mouth? It’s not prey, nor is it a tongue - it’s the shark’s stomach.

There might have been something harmful in there, such as an indigestible item, a parasite or a buildup of mucus. Or, more likely in this particular case, the person behind the camera triggered its fight-or-flight instincts and it’s “ejecting” the extra weight to make a quick getaway.

It’s thought that all sharks possess this ability; their stomach turns inside out, gets pushed out of the mouth, and is quickly retracted. Here’s a beached specimen with its stomach everted:

Plus one studied in a laboratory. Both are shortfin makos.

As it happens, this ability isn’t limited to sharks. Their close relatives the rays also do it, in what is more commonly known as stomach rinsing.

Some rays, such as manta rays, can also perform intestinal eversion, which is done, well… out the other end.

Gastric eversion has also evolved independently in echinoderms such as sea stars, sea cucumbers and sea urchins, and in frogs. To make matters more nauseating, frogs will often use their hands to stroke the heaved-up organ, making sure the nasty stuff gets cleaned away.

So, I’m sure none of you had any intention of seeing this on your dash today, but our beloved algorithm has brought it to you anyway. I’d say have a nice a day, like I usually do, but I think after this read that’s a bit of a big ask.

In any case, take this from this piece: vomiting might not be pleasant, but at least humans don’t retch up their distended stomachs instead.
