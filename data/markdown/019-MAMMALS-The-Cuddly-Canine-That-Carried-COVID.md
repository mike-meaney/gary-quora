There are plenty of great choices one could make here, but I think I’m going to go with the raccoon dog. It’s not the most obscure animal I’ve written about by any means, but it’s not as well known as it ought to be for sure.

Needless to say, they are really damn cute.

The raccoon dog is so named because of the black bands around its eyes, but it is not a raccoon. Rather, it’s a canine species, particularly closely related to the bat-eared fox of Sub-Saharan Africa. This fox (perhaps coincidentally) also has a black mask, despite looking otherwise different.

East Asia, however, is the natural domain of the raccoon dog. It’s native to much of Eastern China, Japan and the Korean Peninsula, as well as parts of Indochina and the Russian Far East. They also now inhabit much of Europe, introduced there by the Soviets.

Within this range, there are five subspecies; procyonoides, viverrinus, ussuriensis, koreensis, and orestes. The third one, the Ussuri raccoon dog, is the one found in Europe, but the second type is the most well-known in online circles - the Japanese raccoon dog, or tanuki.

Speaking of names, raccoon dogs are referred to as neoguri in Korea (which has since become a popular noodle brand there) and mangut by the Evenk people of Russia and northern China.

They are typically a greyish-brown colour, but can occasionally be white:

Or even orange:

There are a few other reasons why I find these guys really interesting. First of all, they’re the only canids in the world which hibernate.

In the leadup to the winter months, raccoon dogs eat loads of food, making sure they’re fattened up. That’s why they often look so marvelously rotund.

Look at that absolute sphere. Some of it is fluff, but there is no other canine which gets that chunky in the wild. When winter comes and they’re in full bulk mode, the dogs begin to hibernate, entering a state of torpor - that is, their body temperature lowers and their metabolism slows down.

If they weren’t cute enough already, they often do so huddled together, which probably helps keep them warm.

In warmer regions, however, raccoon dogs often do not hibernate, or only do so during harsh snowstorms.

In terms of diet, they are not fussy in the slightest. They’ll feed on just about any small animal they can catch, even highly poisonous frogs. When eating these toxic amphibians, they salivate profusely, effectively diluting the poison. They also eat a lot of birds.

As well as live prey, they often consume carrion, dung (not a personal favourite of mine but I’m not one to judge), fruits, vegetables, nuts and berries. To access fruit, they frequently climb trees, something which not many canines can do.

Another thing which is pretty cool about them is their vocalizations. You might expect them to bark, as they are members of the dog family, but their vocal repertoire consists mainly of yelps, whines, mews, and growls. The tanuki variety of Japan is said to sound quite similar to a cat.

When they are juvenile, the father spends a lot more time tending them than the mother, and is, unusually enough, very involved in the process of raising young. Speaking of the young, I can’t help but share this photo of these baby raccoon dogs.

One more fact - this species has been repeatedly noted as a carrier of various forms of coronavirus. Some hypothesize that a raccoon dog was likely one of the original vectors of COVID-19, as they are commonly bred in China.

Anyway, those are some interesting things you might not have known about the raccoon dog, and underrated and cuddly wild animal. Thank you very much for reading, have a great day.
