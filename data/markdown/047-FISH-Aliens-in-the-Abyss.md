The stomiiforms are what immediately jump to mind, for me at least. This is not a single species of fish, but rather a whole order of species, comprising over 400 known types. As you would expect, they all dwell in the deep sea, which means there are probably plenty more stomiiforms to be discovered.

Here are some facts about these creepy critters which will surely convince you that they’re in the running for the title of world’s scariest fish. They’re also really, really interesting!

*   Virtually all species are bioluminescent; that is, they produce light. They do this using rows of organs called photophores, in which the light-emitting molecule coelenterazine reacts with enzymes. These photophores can be beautifully intricate, with lenses, colour filters, specialized muscles and more involved.

*   Many stomiiforms, especially dragonfishes (who we’ll see a lot more of shortly) have transparent teeth, which are invisible to potential prey even in the light of bioluminescence. These teeth are also incredibly strong, embedded with tough microscopic crystals throughout.

*   The biggest stomiiform, the so-called obese dragonfish, is over half a metre long. This may not sound like much, but it’s very large for an animal which lives 5 kilometres below sea level, and it is an apex predator in its environment. It gets its mean name from its rather bloated appearance.

*   The larvae of the black dragonfish are very unique, as they have these huge eye stalks, which are themselves half as long as the body. This setup allows the young dragonfish to rotate their eyeballs in practically any direction, so they can watch for predators at all times in their vulnerable developmental phase.

*   My favourite stomiiform is undoubtedly the freakish stoplight loosejaw. They have no skin below their mouth, hence “loosejaw”, allowing the jaws to lunge out explosively at prey with great speed. Because of this, the incredibly complex structure of the fish jaw is on full display, and they look like veritable alien life forms.

*   The “stoplight” part of the aforementioned fish’ name comes from the red light they produce. This is extremely significant; loosejaws and their relatives are the only fish on Earth which can see and produce red light. The stoplight is therefore really an invisible spotlight, which illuminates the environment, but is imperceptible to prey!

*   The bristlemouths are the world’s most numerous vertebrate, by far. These tiny deep-sea stomiiforms exist in unfathomable abundance down in the abyss, and are thought to number in the trillions, or even quadrillions. Also, they are always born male, and later transform into females - this is known as sequential hermaphroditism.

*   The hatchetfishes are another strange and unique group in this order. Their bulging eyes are permanently angled upward, as they use the faint light from the surface to detect the silhouettes of potential victims overhead. To camouflage and avoid falling prey to the same strategy, they utilize counter-illumination - luminous underbellies.

*   In addition to having black skin from head to toe (or head to caudal fin, I suppose), some dragonfish have a black stomach lining inside them. This blocks out the bioluminescence of the fish they swallow, which might give away their position to predators and would-be prey alike.

*   Speaking of such colouration, the aptly named Pacific blackdragon is one of the blackest organisms in the world - its scales, which are densely packed with melanosomes, absorb 99.5% percent of light which hits them. Perhaps I shouldn’t be telling you this… maybe [Anish Kapoor](https://www.thecollector.com/vantablack-anish-kapoor-stuart-semple-controversy/ "www.thecollector.com") is the only person allowed to write about this fish.

*   One species of stomiiform, Bathophilus indicus, has fangs on its tongue. These help it snag slippery fish, and they angle backwards, so their grip is near impossible to escape. It should come as no surprise to you that, being an overdramatically horrific creature, B. indicus lives in Australia.

So, those are twelve facts about the stomiiforms which should highlight just how bizarre and spooky they really are. Even still, when it comes to deep sea life, they’re about as “normal” as it gets! Thanks for reading, have a great day everybody.
