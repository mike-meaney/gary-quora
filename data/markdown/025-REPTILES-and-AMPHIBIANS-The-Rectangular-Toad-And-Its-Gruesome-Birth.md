## 25. The Rectangular Toad And Its Gruesome Birth

With hundreds of thousands of Amazonian species to choose from, this was a tricky one, but I have resolved to nominate the common Surinam toad. What constitutes ugliness is of course a subjective concept, but this amphibian sure won’t be winning any conventional beauty contests.

The common Surinam toad is a rather rectangular creature found across the Amazon basin. Its tiny eyeballs and muddy brown colour don’t do it many aesthetic favours, but when the females start to give birth, things get really ugly.

During mating, the female releases eggs, which the male fertilizes and embeds in her skin. These eggs gradually sink deeper and deeper into their mother’s back, eventually forming a scattering of pits. While they develop, she has the strange pockmarked appearance pictured above. Then things get weirder still.

After the eggs hatch, the newborn tadpoles stay inside their pockets, eventually growing into fully formed adult toads. They all crawl out of their mother at this stage, in a gooey exodus. Finally, the mother sheds the honeycombed layer of skin off her back in place of a fresh one.

While the common Surinam toad may indeed be ugly, you can’t deny that it is equally fascinating, for a number of reasons in addition to what I just described. Uniquely, these toads do not croak; rather, the males produce rapid, throaty clicks with their tongue bone. Funnily enough, they don’t have actual tongues.

Another cool feature of this species are the tiny star-shaped growths they have on their toes, used for gripping slippery prey. You can see them in the photo below if you look closely.

Anyway, thank you very much for reading everybody. Apologies for my recent lack of activity - I’ve been quite busy recently, but I sure don’t plan on stopping any time soon. I hope you enjoyed the answer, and have a great day.
