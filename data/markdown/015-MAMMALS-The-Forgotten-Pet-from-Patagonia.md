## 15. The Forgotten Pet from Patagonia

Actually, they weren’t. Meet the late Fuegian dog:

Despite its name, this was no dog. Rather, it was a domesticated form of the culpeo, a species of fox which still inhabits much of the Andes mountain range:

Fuegian dogs were kept by the Yaghan people, an ethnic group which are found in the Southern Cone of South America. They were tawny or white in colour, and had erect, triangular ears and a bushy tail. One Argentine explorer described them as “a stunted cross between an Alsatian police dog and a wolf”.

They were used for hunting otters, and, apparently, for warmth. They would gather around their owners, “taking the shape of a kind of wrapping”, keeping them warm in the Patagonian cold. Such good boys.

However, some writers noted that they were much less loyal than a dog of the lupine kind. They would allegedly abandon their owners when they were in danger, and often wandered on their own.

Indeed, their eventual extinction was the result of years of extermination, because they posed a danger to cattle and even humans. The last Fuegian dog likely died out between 1880 and 1919. If they hadn’t gone extinct, then today we might have two species of domestic canine to choose from.
