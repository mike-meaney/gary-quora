## 63. The Beetle That Never Grows Up

Ooh, I’ve been waiting for a question like this. I love to show off the beauty of animals, especially underrated ones. Here are my nominations:

*   Jewel caterpillars, family Dalceridae. Both mesmerizing and strangely edible-looking, their exoskeletons are covered in gelatinous beads which give them their name.

*   Another type of caterpillar (I have a thing for caterpillars), the Wattle Cup caterpillar. Though its adult form is a dull moth, the larvae are colorful and have huge stinging tubercles.

*   The ant Echinopla striata, a Southeast Asian species related to carpenter ants, which is a striking metallic blue. This is a very obscure species so there’s virtually no other information on it.

*   A species of darkling beetle known as Eucyrtus gloriosus (the specific name of course meaning “glorious”), which has a lovely color scheme of shiny purple and gold.

*   The passionvine treehopper, also known as the fluffy bum. Yes, seriously. They have a tuft of white filaments on the end of their abdomens, which can be moved up and down and are used for display.

*   The endangered trilobite beetle, Platerodrilus sp. Obviously, they’re not actually related to trilobites, but are named so due to their flattened bodies and large scales. They can be huge, too - 8 centimetres long when fully grown.

*   The larvae of agrid sawflies, which are deep purple in colour. They resemble caterpillars greatly, but there are differences - mainly different numbers of legs and eyes.

*   The incredible-looking lace bugs, family Trilinidae. Their wings are beautiful, reminiscent of stained-glass mosaics. The intricate, lace-like network which causes this appearance is what gives them their name.

*   Stick insects which, like scorpions, are fluorescent under ultraviolet light. Normally they may look drab, but when exposed to UV light they take on this alien appearance.

*   Eumastacid monkey grasshoppers, which come in many different colours. They hold their hind legs horizontally, at right angles to the body, which is bizarre indeed.

*   There are many beautiful mantises, but I think orchid mantises are the most out of all of them. They’re probably the least obscure species on this list, and mimic flowers to deceive both predators and prey.

There are many more breathtaking insects, and these are just my obscure few suggestions. A lot of people don’t realize how diverse insects really are.

EDIT: A suggestion from [Michalis P.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michalis-P-2 "www.quora.com"); the steelblue ladybird (or ladybug if you’re American), Halmus chalybeus. These carnivorous beetles are a startling iridiscent blue-green and definitely qualify.
