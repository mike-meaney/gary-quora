There are some very nice answers to this questions already, but there’s a type of insect which I think deserves inclusion here too - the strepsipterans. Also known as the “twisted-winged insects”, this is an order of parasites which is quite nasty to its hosts, and yet fascinating for so, so much more.

Let’s cover the basics. Strepsipterans are probably the weirdest of all the insect orders. Their eyes, for example, are really freaking weird. All insects have compound eyes, whereby each “ommatidium” forms a pixel, and together the thousands of ommatidia create a complete image. All insects… except strepsipterans.

Instead, these guys have a few dozen “eyelets”, and each one is a fully functioning eye that produces a complete image. In fact, this eye structure is more similar to that of the ancient trilobites than to any extant arthropod group. It makes their eyes look a lot like blackberries.

What’s most bizarre about this order, however, is the ridiculous sexual dimorphism. Males are only very weird; they’ve got the trilobite eyes, and the adults don’t have mouths, as they only live for about five hours. Otherwise, they more or less resemble flies. Females, on the other hand, are downright absurd.

In the figure above, the photos labelled a and b are of adult females. They’re neotenic: they never metamorphose, instead remaining larval blobs for the rest of their lives. They don’t have wings, eyes, or legs.

But I’m getting distracted - this is the “cruel” part of strepsipteran biology. The females are parasites of many types of arthropod, including grasshoppers, cockroaches and praying mantises. As little larvae, they invade their host through chinks in the exoskeleton, and will never leave. The insect below has several females parasitizing it.

The larvae grow and grow (but, as said, never metamorphose into adults), until they may constitute 90% of the volume of the host’s abdomen! As research in the 90s has shown, it’s likely that insects feel pain, and this must be an excruciating experience for the unfortunate victim of the females. If that wasn’t bad enough, they often castrate their hosts.

But the life cycle just gets weirder. The females begin to exude a scented pheromone which alerts males in the area as to their location. When a male finds one, he’ll mate with her via hypodermic insemination. Basically, he stabs right through the host’s exoskeleton and into the female with a razor sharp reproductive organ - strepsipteran cruelty at work again.

The female’s eggs are fertilized, and later hatch. However, she does not lay them before they do so - instead, the babies emerge internally and just swim around her insides for a while. Eventually, they’ll emerge through the wound from the male’s violent insemination, which is pretty damn metal. The female will later use up all her host’s available blood and starve to death, alone.

And so, the bizarre, fascinating and gruesome life of a female strepsipteran comes to a close. Like so many of the animals I’ve written about in my answers, they’re highly underappreciated for their weirdness and uniqueness. Thanks for reading, and thanks for the A2A Sean.
