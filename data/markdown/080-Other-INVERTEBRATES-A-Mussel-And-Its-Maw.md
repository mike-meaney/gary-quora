You’ve probably eaten more than a few bivalves in your lifetime - clams, mussels, oysters, scallops and the like - but I doubt you know just how diverse these animals are. The bivalve class - represented by aquatic, filter-feeding molluscs with hinged shells - contains over 9,200 known species, found in practically every marine environment, and even plenty of freshwater ecosystems.

Below are my picks for the most unusual, noteworthy, obscure, underrated and interesting species among the bivalves.

* * *

Scallops, i.e. the family Pectinidae. They are by no means obscure or little-known, but they’re one of those animals that everyone knows of, but few people really know.

Did you know, for example, that they can have up to 200 eyes (pictured)? Or that these eyes have a unique mirror-like structure, made of crystal, which has never evolved in any other organism? Or that they can swim backwards at very high speed using water jet propulsion? Scallops are really cool.

Kuphus polythalamius. This may well be one of the weirdest animals I’ve ever written about, and that’s saying something. You’d never know it was a clam, with its 1.5 meter-long worm-like body encased in a tusk-shaped calcium casing known as a crypt.

Strangest of all, though: it eats mud and rock. Literally. The Kuphus’ gills are stuffed with chemotrophic bacteria, which feed on the hydrogen sulfide in the debris it consumes. The mollusc then derives energy from their metabolic waste products . And it can weigh up to 200 kg! Just unbelievably bizarre.

Lioconcha hieroglyphica. This marine clam of the Pacific Ocean is famous for its beautiful markings. They form spiralling rows on its white shell, and are wonderfully reminiscent of some kind of ancient language, like Norse runes, cuneiform script, Ogham or hieroglyphics (hence the name).

Though they may seem random, these symbols actually follow precise mathematical patterns known as cellular automata. This is another cool example of known mathematics showing up in nature.

The geoduck. You may be familiar with this one, as it’s quite common on the coast of the Pacific Northwest, and is considered a delicacy in several East Asian countries. Note that the “geo” is pronounced as “gooey” - the word comes from an indigenous language.

Their standout feature is a thick, slimy siphon emerging from their shell, which can be well over a metre in length, and is used to suck up plankton. It’s one of the longest-lived animals, with a lifespan of up to 168 years.

The snuffbox mussel. It’s part of the unionids, a fascinating group of freshwater mussels which we’ll be seeing more of shortly. The way it reproduces is pretty damn hardcore - the female will lie with her shell fully opened, until a fish comes along and investigates.

Then, she snaps shut, clamping the fish’ head in rows of razor-sharp serrations, and spews her larvae into its gills. The larvae, called glochidia, spend the first part of their life feeding on the fish.

File shells. File shells are able to swim in short bursts using the same mechanism that scallops do, by expelling seawater at high speed using its two valves. However, these guys take it to the next level with their long, orange tentacles.

The tentacles can wave rhythmically and thus function as oars, propelling the file shells along even faster. They can also be detached at will to distract predators, like the tail of a lizard. When shed, the tentacles begin to emit a noxious chemical, which is even more off-putting for the would-be predator.

The orange-nacre mucket. As another unionid, it’s a close relative of the vicious snuffbox mussel we’ve already met. The species in this family all reproduce the same way; by ejecting parasitic larvae called glochidia in the gills of passing fish.

While the snuffbox uses a violent approach, the orange-nacre mucket is more of a trickster. It has fleshy appendages fringing its shell which mimic a little minnow, so that when a predator like a carp comes along and tries to vacuum up the faux fish, it sucks up the mucket’s glochidia.

The giant clam. Chances are you’ve seen this one before, so it’s not the most obscure species on this list, but it’s the largest bivalve on Earth so it’d be silly not to include it. The heaviest known specimen was found off the coast of Japan, and weighed an estimated 340 kilograms!

Giant clams can grow to such size even in nutrient-poor coral reefs thanks to their symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic algae, which give them extra nutrition. Each clam contains a dense and complex circulation system on which the algae, known as zooxanthellae, grows. It supplies them with nitrates and phosphates, they supply it with food (their metabolic waste).

The piddocks. These marine clams may be the most boring creatures ever featured in my answers; boring in that they literally bore. Using ridges of serrated teeth on their shells, they ever-so-slowly burrow into solid rock and live in there for the rest of their lives, sticking a siphon out of the hole to feed.

You may have even seen their burrows in person, if you’ve gone to the beach - those pockmarked holes you see in rocks. The tunnels are often appropriated by sea anemones after the clam dies. Also, you’d never think it, but piddocks are the closest relatives of shipworms like the aforementioned Kuphus.

The fan mussel. This most marvellous marine Mediterranean mollusc is a real big boy, as it can measure over 1.2 metres in length. It’s no wonder it’s so large, as it grows at a breakneck pace of 20 cm annually. To fasten its hefty frame to the seabed, it uses fibrous strands of keratin called byssus, which can be made into a prized and rare material called sea silk.

Another fascinating thing about the fan mussel is that it hosts a symbiotic species of shrimp within its shell! This gives the shrimp shelter, and in return the shrimp alerts the mussel to danger by snapping its claws. Sadly, it is critically endangered.

The Dinaric cave clam. Its name tells you a lot about why it’s so interesting and cool, as it is indeed one of the very, very few bivalves which live exclusively in caves. Specifically it is found in the submersed limestone caverns beneath the Dinaric Alps of southeastern Europe.

Its adaptations to subterranean life are many. The clam has lost all pigmentation, and the ability to move, as it has to spend the scant calories it gets in the cave solely on basic organ functions. It’s tough, too, as it can seemingly live well over 60 years and survive out of water for months on end.

The thick-shelled river mussel. Like the snuffbox mussel and the orange-nacred mucket, this is a unionid - our third and final species in this family. And, like those two species, it has a very interesting way of transferring its parasitic larvae (glochidia) into fish.

This mussel will affix itself to the shallows near the bank of a river and spout a stream of water towards the opposite bank, like a fountain. For a long time, the reason behind this was a mystery, but it has fairly recently been discovered that they use the water spout to launch their glochidia into the river!

(I couldn’t find any good photos of this behaviour, unfortunately)

The cuspidariids. I would describe these as being to clams what Venus flytraps are to regular plants. They tend to inhabit very nutrient-poor environments, where there isn’t enough phytoplankton to get by. Instead, they resorted to a more high-calorie food source - animals.

Yes, cuspidariids (and their close relatives the poromyids) are among the only predatory bivalves! And they do that without even moving - rather, they bury themselves in the seabed, concealed except for sensory tentacles and a huge siphon, which vacuums up passing crustaceans.

The spiny oysters. Despite their name, they are not oysters, but are in fact close cousins of the scallops. Like their relatives, they have numerous bead-like eyes lining the fringes of their shell.

The namesake feature of the spiny oysters is of course their array of long calcium spikes, which protect them from predators. Their unique shells have been used since the Stone Age to make ornaments, jewellery, and even mortar, in several far-flung cultures of the world.

Last but not least, Gaimardia trapesina. This clam is commonly found affixed to floating clusters of kelp all across the sub-Antarctic region. They do not eat this kelp, however - no, they use it as a solution to the problem most bivalves face; how do you let your young colonize new territory if you can’t move?

Most clams respond to this by casting out their sperm and eggs so the offspring are born externally - the downside of this is that the babies are very under-developed. Because G. trapesina hitches a ride on moving kelp “rafts”, it can bring its young to pastures new, while also letting them gestate internally and be fully developed at the time of birth.

I doubt you thought you’d end up reading about fifteen different practically brainless molluscs today, but here we are. We’ve seen everything from undersea sarlaacs, rock-eating worms, and rock-boring clams to cave-dwelling relics, fountains of larvae and minnow mimicry.

If you’ve made it this far, I hope you found at least some of these interesting - thank you very, very much for reading, and have a great day.
