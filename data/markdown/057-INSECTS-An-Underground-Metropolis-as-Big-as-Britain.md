In the Caatinga of Brazil, there is a complex of termite mounds, constructed by the species Syntermes dirus. It is quite similar to any other typical termite colony, except this colony is approximately the size of Great Britain.

Covering an area of roughly 228,000 square kilometres, this immense complex contains over 200 million mounds, each 10 meters in diameter and 3 meters tall. The termites have excavated about 10 billion cubic metres of soil, and so Herculean a feat this was that it took them nearly 4,000 years to construct.

This is a construction on a grander scale than virtually any structure humans have built. And all this by creatures tens of millions of times smaller than us! Someone who wonders if other animals can build things would, by their logic, also wonder if humans can.
