## 23. The Treacherous Tactics of the Tentacled Snake

I nominate the tentacled snake. This bizarre-looking serpent dwells in lakes, streams and rice paddies in Southeast Asia, and it gets its name from the strange pair of sensory structures which protrude from its snout.

However, its hunting behaviour is something which is often overlooked. Here’s how it works:

The tentacled snake will lie, often semi-buried in the sediment, with its body in a “J” shape, using its tail to anchor it to the bottom. They can do this for up to half an hour without coming up for air, and may not ever venture on to the land.

When unsuspecting fish swim by, the snake will exploit a trademark of fish biology, using what’s usually one of their most important adaptations to its advantage.

When the fish enters striking range, the tentacled snake shifts part of its body slightly, creating vibrations in the water. The vibrations are detected by the fish’s Mauthner cells - a pair of large neurons - which in turn trigger an incredibly fast escape reflex known as the C-start response.

The C-start is so named because it makes the fish’s body contort into a “C” shape, propelling it away. It is highly effective against most predators, but the tentacled snake has learned to combat it.

Because the head is perpendicular to the part of the body where the twitch came from, the fish moves to escape in the wrong direction, and - instead of following its motion like any other predator would - the tentacled snake anticipates its position in advance, catching it before it can straighten out and complete the C-start.

This amazing predictive ability is not something which must be learned, it seems, as experiments have been done on laboratory-born tentacled snakes and they can execute the strike with perfect anticipation too. Thus, this is likely an innate behaviour, hardwired into their nervous system.
