Here’s one which not a lot of people know about: some birds feed pond fish as if they were their own young.

In 2010, someone filmed a northern cardinal feeding pet goldfish in their garden pond. Allegedly, the bird does this up to six times each day. What on Earth could be going on?

It’s not the first time someone has observed this. One photo, probably taken in the early sixties depicts an incredibly similar incident, and has featured in numerous textbooks from the ’60s and ‘70s.

Other cases I managed to find include this short video of a duckling feeding koi:

Another one of a Brazilian teal with some kind of fish:

And several clips/photos of black swans seemingly feeding koi from China and Taiwan.

So, are these birds just Good Samaritans looking out for their freshwater friends? Seemingly random acts of kindness aren’t unknown in the animal world - some of you may know of [the lioness who “adopted” a baby oryx.](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-bizarre-animal-behaviors-that-not-many-people-know-about/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")

However, this is likely not the explanation here. Rather, there are two separate explanations. In the last four instances I mentioned, the birds “feeding” the koi were waterfowl, specifically in the family Anatidae. More or less all birds in this family often dip their food in the water, perhaps to make it easier to swallow.

Essentially, the birds are just getting robbed by the fish. Not as heartwarming an explanation as one would hope for, but it doesn’t explain the cardinals…

The best answer to the question of the first two birds is one which has been pointed out by a few people. To a bird, this:

might look a lot like this:

It would appear that the cardinals interpret the gaping, bright red mouths of the goldfish as those of young cardinal chicks. The parental instinct kicks in, and they start feeding the fish.

This is a great example of how adaptations can have “unintended” side effects - in feeding the goldfish, the cardinals are wasting food they could otherwise eat themselves (or, you know, give to their actual kids), so you’d think they and their young would be at a selective disadvantage. However, since populations of cardinals are overall better off with the parental instinct than without, the net result is that the behaviour continues.
