That is a good question - as you say, Russia’s Lake Baikal is where you’d least expect to find wild marine mammals. The nearest ocean water to the lake is the Sea of Okhotsk, with over 1,500 kilometres of dry land in between. Nevertheless, Lake Baikal is the haunt of the Baikal seal, the world’s only exclusively freshwater pinniped and also the smallest species in the group.

Also known as nerpas, Baikal seals usually measure between 1 and 1.4 metres long and weigh, on average, 63–70 kilograms. Thankfully, they’re classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, with about 100,000 individuals in their ranks. The primary food source of the nerpa is the golomyanka, a very strange species of fish found in the lake.

At the end of the day, we really don’t know for sure how Baikal seals got to Lake Baikal. Some speculate that their ancestors made their way there by way of the Paratethys - a huge inland sea which occupied a sizeable chunk of Eurasia during the Miocene, of which the Black, Caspian and Aral Seas may well be remnants.

The idea is that Miocene seals living in the Mediterranean would have come up through the Paratethys and then, over millennia, migrated along connective rivers and lakes all the way up to Lake Baikal - giving rise to another seal species, the Caspian seal, in the process.

However, this hypothesis definitely has its flaws. The Baikal seal is well-adapted to frigid climes (for their size, they have the largest claws of any seal, a feature which allows them to scrape out breathing holes in the ice), and thus don’t seem like animals of Mediterranean origins. They’re much more similar to the (usually) marine ringed seal of the Arctic Ocean.

Additionally, genetic studies show that Baikal seals are more closely related to ringed seals than Caspian seals. This would also throw the Paratethyan theory into question, as it maintains that both Baikal and Caspian seals are the result of the same inland migration. What’s more likely is that Baikal seals came from the Arctic.

Many species in Lake Baikal are clearly related to animals of the Arctic ocean, such as the omul (a common fish, endemic to the lake, pictured above), which is in the exclusively cold-water genus Coregonus. This would also explain the Baikal seal’s adaptations to an icy environment.

But the question still remains - how did seals cross the 2,000 kilometers which lies between the Arctic Ocean and the lake? Well, what we do know is that about 80,000 years ago, there was an enormous lake (twice the size of the Caspian Sea) in Siberia which was connected to Lake Baikal via the Angara River:

The only problem is that molecular clock evidence indicates that Baikal seals diverged, in an evolutionary sense, from other seals about 4 million years ago, long before this lake existed. It seems very likely that they migrated through Siberian lakes from the Arctic ocean, but - for now, at least - we don’t know anything about the nature of said lakes.
