## 78. The Four-Eyed Butcher in the Deep

Thankfully, we haven’t come across any Xenomorphs in the real natural world. Yet. However, there certainly are a handful of very real creatures which have characteristics in common with the movie monsters. One group of animals that came to mind for me would be caecilians.

Though they could be mistaken for worms, caecilians are in fact legless amphibians. Up close, you can see their sharp teeth and sometimes even their saliva, which recall the dripping, drooling jaws of a Xenomorph. One species - the ringed caecilian - is thought to possibly even have venom glands in its fangs.

There’s a lot more about these amphibians that makes them fascinating. They are nearly blind, can be up to 1.5 metres long, secrete toxic substances which can induce hemolysis, and have a pair of sensory tentacles in front of their eyes, as well as an extremely complex array of jaw muscles and hard calcite scales embedded within their skin. I suppose they deserve a full answer of their own someday…

Anyway, back to the aliens. In the movies, they have a second, inner set of jaws within their mouth. There are in fact real life animals which have this same feature - moray eels.

Many fish have what are known as pharyngeal teeth; teeth located deep in the their throat. However, morays are unique in having a fully functioning, articulated set of pharyngeal jaws. When they open their mouth, these jaws lunge forward to grab onto prey, and retract as the mouth is closed.

Most fish swallow their food by using suction: they create a pressure differential between the surrounding water and their mouths, vacuuming up their victim. Moray eels cannot really do this effectively, as they live in cramped underwater tunnels. Instead, they have Xenomorph jaws.

Another sea creature which bears an uncanny resemblance to the fictitious extraterrestrials is Phronima, a deep-sea crustacean (an amphipod, to be more specific). In addition to its plated exoskeleton, it has what looks like a long crest extending from the back of its head, just like a Xenomorph. Despite appearances, this is in fact a huge pair of tubular eyes!

Weirdly enough, this is but one of two pairs of eyes Phronima has. Even stranger are its habits; a mother will track down a salp (a kind of gelatinous, sac-shaped animal), hollow out its viscera with her claws, and lay her eggs within the unwilling hosts. The disemboweled salp floats away with the current, and her offspring eventually emerge in new territory. Much like a chestburster!

Even more like chestbursters are parasitoid wasps. There are well over half a million species of parasitoid wasp, all from various different groups which have independently evolved the same grisly habits. They are united by their parasitic lifestyle - more specifically, they are parasites who kill their hosts, or parasitoids. There are myriad different ways they carry out their life cycle - far too many to discuss right now. Perhaps they too need a future answer.

Anyways, the most famous strategy employed by parasitoid wasps is the laying of eggs within a larger host - usually a caterpillar, though practically any kind of insect is used by one wasp species or another. When the eggs hatch, the newborn larvae begin to eat their host from the inside out, eventually emerging to the outside world like a baby Xenomorph.

The last animal I will bring up is Prasinohaema, a genus of tree-dwelling skinks found only on New Guinea and the neighbouring Solomon Islands. These lizards have an extraordinary tolerance for the acidic chemical biliverdin. We, too, contain biliverdin, but in minuscule quantities, and an excess of the stuff causes jaundice. If enough of it is present, we die.

The bloodstream of Prasinohaema skinks has a biliverdin concentration forty times higher than that lethal dosage! Believe it or not, their blood is actually bright green because of this content, making them one of only three vertebrates which don’t have red blood. In any case, this reminded me of the acid blood of the aliens.

So, that’s my out of this world lineup of five curious creatures which meet your criteria. I hope you found this answer interesting, thank you all very much for reading, and have a great day.
