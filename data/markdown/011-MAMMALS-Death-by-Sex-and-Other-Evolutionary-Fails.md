The upper canines of the male babirusa grow upwards, not downwards, erupting out of its skin, and - if they develop enough - curving all the way back to pierce its skull and kill it. By that stage, it’ll already have passed on its genes, so evolution doesn’t care.

Tasmanian devils have evolved a common social habit of biting each other. However, that is the perfect way to transmit Devil Facial Tumour Disease, a transmissable cancer which has scourged the entire species and brought them to the brink of extinction. This is the least heartbreaking picture I could find:

This is the black-tailed antechinus, a small, carnivorous marsupial. During the mating season, males mate so much that they’re left physically exhausted and fatally crippled. The exertion makes their vital organs fail and within weeks scores of males have died.

Because they live exclusively in moist environments and breathe through their skin, almost all species of amphibian are vulnerable to one fatal disease, chytridiomycosis. And it’s taking its toll - global amphibian populations are declining sharply and some have been completely wiped out.

Lastly, human intelligence. Over the course of human evolution, various selective pressures have resulted in us being the most intelligent species on Earth. We have an astounding capability to build complex tools which allow us to live luxurious lives and become veritably invicible. Look how that’s turned out for us.

Evolution has no foresight, and it can often lead species into dead ends, where their adaptations turn on them. Living in a developed country, the devastating effects of our paradoxical “intelligence” you might not yet have felt. But for every slave, Syrian refugee, or victim of global warming-induced flooding and wildfires, they know all about it.
