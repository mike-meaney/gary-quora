## 48. How to Get Drunk on Shark

For such a diverse and influential group of animals, sharks have made precious little appearances in my previous answers. This question will be a good opportunity to remedy that negligence.

They’ve been around for a staggering 420 million years, predating the first dinosaurs, the first land-dwelling vertebrates, and even the first trees. There are more than half a thousand species, spread across every corner of the world’s oceans. In this answer, for brevity, I’m just going to be talking about modern sharks, as delving into the vast array of prehistoric sharks would double the length at least.

So, without further ado, here are my best shark facts. Enjoy!

*   Some tropical shark species, such as hammerheads, are highly social during the day. In summer, they migrate in massive schools, searching for cooler waters. When night falls, they all take to the reefs and split up to hunt for fish. These schools are often more than a hundred strong, though groups of several thousand have even been reported!

*   Sand tiger sharks have a very macabre tendency known as intrauterine cannibalism. A pregnant sand tiger has two wombs, each containing many eggs, but only one newborn emerges from each. That’s because the first fetus to develop functioning teeth kills and eats its embryonic siblings! This brutal behaviour ensures that the baby shark enters the world with a boost of growth from its prenatal snack.

*   Continuing with the theme of grotesque habits, sharks have an unusual ability that they use to eject unwanted stomach contents - gastric eversion. The stomach can be turned inside-out and pushed out of the mouth, before quickly being retracted. This tactic can be used to shed excess weight for a quick getaway, or to get rid of a parasite or indigestible object.

*   Only one genus of shark lives exclusively in freshwater, the river sharks, pictured. There are three species, which inhabit South and Southeast Asia, as well as Australasia. Unfortunately, they are extremely rare, so scientists don’t know very much about them. Some marine species, such as the smooth dogfish, sandbar shark and bull shark have been known to enter freshwater, too - the third was once found 1,100 kilometres up the Mississippi River!

*   The reason that there are so few freshwater sharks is to do with osmoregulation. In order to be in osmotic balance with the the surrounding seawater, most sharks’ blood is very salty, rich in chemicals like urea and trimethylamine oxide. Because of this, they cannot survive in the much less salty environment of fresh water. It also means that dead sharks usually have a very strong smell of ammonia.

*   No sharks contains more urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) than the deep sea’s sleeper sharks, in the family Somniosidae. Eating the flesh of a sleeper shark can lead to symptoms of extreme drunkenness that last for days. This is because trimethylamine is a powerful toxin and nerve agent. To avoid these ailments, Icelandic people let sleeper meat ferment for months, producing a dish called hákarl - quite the acquired taste, apparently.

*   The most famous sleeper shark is undoubtedly the Greenland shark, a sluggish, lumbering resident of the Arctic Ocean. In terms of scale, it’s an absolute sea monster, with the largest specimens weighing in excess of a tonne. However, the Greenland shark’s most impressive is its longevity - one individual’s age was estimated to be at the very least 272, and possibly as old as 512! This makes it the oldest-living vertebrate.

*   Sharks differ from the bony fish in that they don’t have swim bladders: gas-filled organs which are used to control buoyancy. Instead, they use their livers, which are filled with an oily substance called squalene. By altering the composition of this oil, they can increase or decrease their buoyancy. A shark’s liver can constitute nearly a third of its body mass. Some sharks, like the pictured zebra shark, have negative buoyancy, as they spend their days on the seafloor.

*   Of these bottom-dwelling sharks, the most outlandish is perhaps the tasselled wobbegong. With beige colouration and a jagged fringe of fleshy lobes surrounding its head, it blends in perfectly with the seafloor - can you even spot it in the photo below? To acquire and kill unsuspecting prey, it has a wiggly fish-shaped tail which it uses as a lure, and an enormous mouth capable of swallowing whole sharks nearly as big as the wobbegong itself!

*   Also in Australia, there exists another interesting species of carpet shark - one which can crawl on land. The epaulette shark lives in shallow tide pools, which are small and cramped but crowded with respiring organisms. As a result, the shark must tolerate an extreme scarcity of oxygen - it can comfortably live for hours without any oxygen at all, in fact. Thus, if its tide pool dries up, the epaulette shark can simply walk to a new pool.

*   The thresher sharks, a family of three species found all over the world, have a very interesting hunting strategy. They get their name from their enormous, scythe-like tails, which can be several metres in length. When hunting, a thresher shark will use its tail to slap and stun fish, or even slice them in half! They are pretty big, too, with the largest species weighing up to 500 kilograms.

*   Threshers, along with another shark family (the mackerel sharks), are among the world’s only endothermic, or warm-blooded, fish. They have heat-generating strips of muscle in the centre of their body, and an intricate, tangled system of blood vessels called a rete mirabile (“miraculous net”) to retain the heat produced. Mackerel sharks, or lamnids, are very energetic thanks to this trait - they’re the fastest sharks in the world.

*   Another weird physiological feature that some sharks have is biofluorescence. If you shine blue light on a swell shark or a chain catshark, it will emit an eery green glow. Down in the deep sea, the only light that can penetrate the abyss from above is blue. By absorbing that blue light and reflecting it back as green, the sharks stand out sharply to each other in the depths. The fluorescent substances also seem to play a role in protection from bacteria.

*   Speaking of the swell shark, this species has a very unusual defensive behaviour which gives it its name. If threatened by a predator, it contorts itself until it can grab its tail with its mouth, before sucking up water, causing its body to inflate. In this engorged state, it’s very hard for a would-be attacker to get its jaws around the swell shark. The leucistic individual pictured below went viral as a supposed “alien" on Instagram in 2016.

*   No shark, however, has been misidentified as a supernatural creature more times than the basking shark. On several occasion, mangled carcasses (“globsters") of this filter-feeding giant have led to wild speculation about sea monsters and living plesiosaurs. The most famous case was a decomposing basking shark, missing fins and much of its head, caught by the Japanese trawler Zuiyō Maru in 1977.

*   While we're talking about prehistoric monsters, allow me to introduce you to the frilled sharks. This 84 million year old family contains two living species, which have hardly changed since the Cretaceous. With a serpentine form and a reptilian head, they certainly look the part. They lack the powerful jawbones of more advanced sharks, instead using the power of suction and a rather bizarre set of jagged teeth to tackle their prey (primarily squid).

*   The frilled shark isn’t the only living fossil under the sea - for example, the rare goblin shark’s lineage is even more ancient. It’s the last surviving species in the family Mitskurinidae, which is a staggering 125 million years old. Goblin sharks are characterized by a big blade-like snout which projects from their skull, and pink colouration they get from blood vessels beneath the skin. It’s likely that they are ambush predators, catching passing fish by shooting their protrusible jaws forward.

*   The viper dogfish is another shark with a marvellously mobile mouth. Rather than snapping and biting its prey like other dogfish, this deepwater-dwelling species engulfs its poor victims whole. This is enabled by a special bone in the skull called the hyomandibula, which swings forward, rapidly extending the jaws far out in front to seize prey. Viper dogfish look about as horrific as you’d expect such gruesome sea monsters to look…

*   Now, we move from the viper dogfish to the Portuguese dogfish. You’d think that the two were closely related, but the latter’s name is a misnomer; it actually belongs to the aforementioned sleeper shark family. The Portuguese dogfish has the distinction of being the deepest-living of all the sharks, with one specimen recorded at a positively crushing depth of 3,675 metres. Down there, it has to withstand 36 million pascals of water pressure.

*   In 2001 at the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha, keepers were shocked to find their female bonnethead shark swimming around with a newborn pup, despite there being no males in the aquarium. Who fathered the baby? In truth, there was no father - this was the first documented case of parthenogenesis, or virgin birth, in sharks. The new shark was a perfect genetic clone of the mother, produced by the fusion of an egg cell and one of its inert “sister” gametes.

*   That’s not the only noteworthy thing about this species - it’s omnivorous, too. Yes, the bonnethead is the only shark known to eat plant matter; seagrass constitutes the majority of its diet. This must require some specialized adaptations in the digestive system, as the cellulose-rich grass would be impossible for other sharks to break down. It’s thought that bonnethead eats so much veggies in order to cushion its gut from the sharp spines of blue crabs, another dietary staple.

*   Time to transition from one of the least specialized sharks to one of the most specialized, at least in terms of diet. The cookiecutter shark is the species I speak of. Using the round, fleshy sucker it has for a mouth, this shark famously latches onto larger animals and leaves a crater-shaped bite mark. Practically anything big enough is fair game, even humans. In the ’70s and ‘80s, several US Navy submarines were incapacitated by suspected “enemy weaponry” which turned out to be cookiecutter sharks!

*   You might have heard of sawfish, which, despite appearances, are a type of ray. There also exist sawsharks - sharks which have a long, flat snout, or rostrum, lined with sharp spines and a conspicuous pair of tendrils called barbels. The function of these barbels is not well understood - nor is much about sawsharks. It’s likely that they use their rostra more like swords than saws, slashing them from side to side to slice or bludgeon their prey.

*   To counteract the several deep sea horrors you’ve seen in this answer, here’s an adorable deep sea delight: the pocket shark. It does not get its name from its diminutive size, but rather a strange pair of pockets it has next to its fins. No one really knows exactly what these pockets do, but the prevailing hypothesis is that they secrete some kind of luminous fluid. The species is still poorly studied, as it’s known only from one location, deep in the South Pacific.

*   The biggest shark is of course the whale shark, which measures up to 18 metres in length. Like all sharks, its skin is covered in microscopic structures called dermal denticles, which are in fact modified teeth! It is, however, unique in the fact that even its eyeballs have their own layer of denticles, with several thousand on each. They most likely serve as armour, protecting the eyes, which lack lids and protrude out from the side of the head.

*   The angular roughshark is another species that has some unusual denticles. They are much larger than in other sharks, with each nodule being clearly visible. The largest denticles form a pair of rather strange-looking knobs above and below the eyes, which give the roughshark an amusingly weary appearance. Its tall hunchback and pig-like snout likewise contribute to this bizarre but humorous look.

*   An even more freaky-looking shark was found in Mexico back in 2011. It was a pale unborn fetus with one particular standout feature: it only had one eye. It wasn’t just missing an eye on the opposite side - no, its singular eyeball was in the center of its head, like that of a mythical Cyclops. Indeed, this genetic anomaly is known as cyclopia, and has been observed in human babies before.

*   That’s not the only insane deformity sharks can have. Just last year, another oddball turned up off Sardinia - a blackmouth catshark which had neither skin nor teeth. Unlike the Cyclops shark, which was stillborn, this one was somehow alive and healthy! As the experts among you will know, skin and teeth tend to come in rather handy when you’re a shark, so it’s a mystery how this catshark managed to survive so long.

If you stuck around for the whole answer, thank you very much. I hope you found it interesting. Happy New Year, everyone - I wish you all health and happiness in 2022.
