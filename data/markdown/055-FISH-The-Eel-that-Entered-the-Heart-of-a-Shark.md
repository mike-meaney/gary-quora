## 55. The Eel that Entered the Heart of a Shark

I think that the most interesting and bizarre parasite of all would be rhizocephalan barnacles, but as I’ve written on them [before](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-oddest-lifeform-ever-discovered/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"), I’ll go with a close second - the snubnosed eel.

Warning: graphic imagery ahead

The snubnosed, or pug-nosed, eel - scientifically termed Simenchelys parasitica \- is perhaps the most gruesome and grisly parasite I can think of. As juveniles, they are ecologically similar to hagfish - deep sea scavengers, although they sometimes feed on microscopic crustaceans.

However, as they grow up, they get a lot more nasty. They become parasites of larger fish - halibut, for example. The eels latch onto their host and then start slowly burrowing in, sometimes going all the way to the spine, or even finding themselves in the fish’ abdominal cavity.

Imagine how agonizing that must be for the host fish - to have another animal gradually worm its way into your body. But it gets worse.

In 1992, fishermen at Montauk, New York State, landed a huge shortfin mako shark - 395 kilograms in weight, in fact. They cut it open and discovered two snubnosed eels, each close to a foot long, nestled inside the shark’s heart, feeding on its blood.

How they got into the heart is unclear, but scientists hypothesize that perhaps they entered the gills or even the throat of the mako, and from that point somehow got into the circulatory system. In any case, the eels had been there long enough for much of the damaged heart tissue to regenerate.

To have an eel burrow into your heart must be one of the most excruciating things in the whole natural world. I, for one, am glad I’m not a fish.
