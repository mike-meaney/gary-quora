## 72. When Insects Play Dress-Up

There are innumerable species which care very much about the appearance of their body. In most animals, one sex tends to be picky about who they mate with. This is generally the females - since they bear the young, they invest a lot more energy into reproduction than the males, and thus ought to have the most genetically gifted offspring possible. They want more bang for their buck, in other words.

So, to impress prospective mates, hopeful animal suitors employ a vast array of “sexual display” tactics. The most common strategies include dances, displays of dominance over competing males, impressive structures on the body such as antlers, and of course vibrant colouration.

However, beautification and transformation of the body is far from as universal as that. In fact, I can think of only one non-human example of an animal deliberately altering its appearance with external material in order to be more attractive: the bearded vulture.

Also known as the lammergeier, the bearded vulture is a fascinating bird - up to 90% of its diet can consist solely of bone, and one individual is thought to have killed the famous ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus by dropping a tortoise on his head.

Bearded vultures also frequently bathe themselves in dust and mud which is rich in reddish iron oxides. The result is that, despite their actual plumage being white underneath, they always have a vivid red, orange or gold colour.

They do this for no apparent reason other than to beautify themselves, making this behaviour both a very interesting example of tool use and the only instance of cosmetics in the animal world (that I’m aware of).

That being said, it is quite common for creatures (invertebrates, mostly) to get dressed up not to attract attention, but to avoid it. This is known as self-decoration camouflage, and has cropped up a surprising number of times in evolution. First of all, there are insects, such as Acanthaspis petax.

This East African creepy crawly kills ants, sucks out their organs with digestive enzymes, and stacks their desiccated carcasses atop its back in order to camouflage itself. This may be to break up its silhouette, or just to render itself unrecognizable to predators. Whatever the case, it’s metal as hell.

The young nymphs of another assassin bug species, the masked hunter, coat themselves in dust and sand to blend in with the environment.

Caddisfly larvae wear protective “cases” - tubes of sticky, secreted silk which are covered in debris such as pebbles, shells, and plant matter. One artist gave some captive larvae pieces of gold and gemstones to build their cases from, with beautiful results.

The larvae of many lacewings also like to wear debris, although this is to disguise themselves from potential prey. Like Acanthaspis petax, they often cover themselves in the corpses of their past victims; aphids in this case. Eventually this leads to them looking like some abomination from The Thing.

In fact, insects have been using debris to camouflage for a long, long time. Hallucinochrysa, an extinct 100 million year old insect from Burma, did the exact same thing.

Self-decoration camouflage can also be observed in the oceans. The textbook example is the aptly-named decorator crabs, of which there are around a dozen species. They attach sponges, crinoids, bryozoans, algae and other aquatic organisms to their carapaces, helping them go unseen by predators.

Some species even recruit venomous or otherwise harmful animals, such as stinging anemones, hydrozoans and noxious seaweeds, which are even more effective at warding off attackers.

The rather pretty candy crab has similar habits; it attaches live coral polyps to its spiny shell for camouflage.

Also, when threatened by predators such as sharks, octopuses may wall themselves up within seashells, although this tactic may have more to do with armouring than hiding. There’s a common octopus beneath the shelly lump pictured below.

So, long story short, self-adornment is a frequent occurrence in the natural world, but most of the time it’s for camouflage rather than beautification. It also seems to be restricted to marine life and insects, which I assume is because carrying around heavy debris is very hard on land, unless you’re really tiny.

I should, however, also mention that there are animals which decorate their environment so they can be more attractive. A shining example would of course be the bowerbirds, a family of avians native to Australia and New Guinea. The males build structures from twigs, or bowers, and then festoon them with colourful trinkets, like berries, flowers or even man-made objects.

They colour-code the decorations, and sometimes even arrange objects according to their size so that smaller ones are closer to the foreground. This suggests that bowerbirds have a pretty sophisticated sense of aesthetics and that they understand perspective, which in itself is fascinating.
