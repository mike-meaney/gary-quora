## 16. Killer Whales and Their Culture

Killer whales have what’s called a cosmopolitan distribution; that is, their range extends over much of the planet, and so with all that distance between some populations, distinct “ecotypes” have emerged which not only look different but have different dialects of language and hunting cultures.

It’s commonly taught that there are two “races” of killer whale - resident and transient - but that’s not entirely true. There are actually 8 more of these variations, each with their own specific behaviours and appearances.

Resident and Ross Sea Killer Whales feed mainly on fish, Antarctic Type A and Type 2 Eastern North Atlantic Killer Whales hunt, primarily, whales and other cetaceans, and Bigg’s Killer Whales are sort of generalist mammal-eaters. Ever seen a pod of orcas “wave-wash” a Weddell seal off an iceberg?

Those’ll be Pack Ice Killer Whales. Gerlache Killer Whales commonly go after penguins, while Offshore Killer Whales are shark specialists. The preferred prey of the recently identified Subantarctic Killer Whale is not yet known.

The only real difference between human “ethnicities” is not genetic, but cultural and social. So, I’ve shown you an animal with geographically varying cultures, but granted, it’s just one. If you were to ask “Why are there so few animals with ethnicity?, then the answer would be;

The existence of ethnicities first requires culture, and culture is something which incredibly few animals have. In addition to that, you need a huge distribution range like humans or orcas, which is why elephants or chimpanzees don’t have ethnicities.

Hope this answers your question.
