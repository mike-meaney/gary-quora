One of the most fascinating families of birds is Ptilonorhynchidae - the bowerbirds. Found only in Australia and Papua New Guinea, there are many interesting things about them - from the way they [rub their wings with ants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anting_(bird_activity)#History "en.wikipedia.org") to their [catfishing habits](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a816683/planet-earth-bird-catfished-heart-david-attenborough-narrates/ "www.digitalspy.com"). But here, Iâ€™ll talk about how they seem to have an aesthetic sense.

Bowerbirds are best-known for their unique courtship strategy, where the male builds a structure (bower) out of sticks (usually avenue-shaped as pictured above, but some species have roofed, hut-like bowers, and one builds no bower at all). This is then decorated with colorful trinkets. This mating behaviour demonstrates an aesthetic sense in a few ways.

First of all, the birds colour-code their displays. They place all their red objects in one area, all their blue ones in another, and so on. Some males will only collect things of a single colour (often blue for satin bowerbirds, or grey/white for great bowerbirds). All this indicates that the females find this visually and aesthetically pleasing.

Secondly, some species understand perspective. Male great bowerbirds (the largest species of bowerbird) usually arrange the displays so that the largest objects are at the back and the smallest at the front. Thus, when a female enters the avenue of the bower, all the objects appear the same size - presumably also aesthetically pleasing.

Why certain things simply look satisfying is somewhat mysterious even in humans, but what does make sense is why the males work so hard (arranging their collections of hundreds of objects for hours on end) to seduce the females and pass on their genes.
