Our perception of colour is different to that of other animals, and that’s important to keep in mind. Take placental mammals, for example. To a deer in a lush forest, a prowling tiger would not appear orange. If it did, it wouldn’t be very good at ambushing its prey.

Rather, the deer would perceive the tiger as the same colour as the surrounding vegetation.

Let’s take a closer look and explain why this is. Humans, of course, are primates, and to be more specific we are part of the Old World monkeys, or catarrhines. Most catarrhines are trichromatic \- in their eyes, they have three different types of cones, which are colour-receptive cells.

These three cone cells detect red, blue and green. If red and green fire at once, the brain interprets that as yellow. All other colours are some combination of the previous four. Because we can distinguish red/yellow (orange) from green, a human or a macaque could see the orange tiger in the green grass.

There are a couple of possible reasons why Old World monkeys became trichromats. It may have been to spot fruit in the trees, or perhaps to notice when one of their peers blushes. Subtle changes in skin tone are one of the many social cues which are important for cooperation in primates.

Reptiles, including birds, are also trichromatic. This is why birds often have such vibrant, colourful plumage, and indeed why there are many green reptiles. That brings me to a second point, which is that there certainly are green animals.

Some of you may now be wondering - given that our reptilian ancestors were trichromatic - why mammals lost one of their cone cells, only to re-evolve it with the Old World primates. The thing is, while trichromacy is obviously great for colour vision, it’s not the best for seeing in the dark. Old World monkeys are all diurnal, so we don’t have this problem.

However, when the first placental mammals evolved, the world was dominated by dinosaurs, which were far larger and hungrier than them. They could only come out during the night, when most of the trichromatic dinosaurs were inactive. They lost one of their three cone cells in order to have improved night vision, and became dichromatic.

This means that they use the same colour receptor for red and green, and thus any kind of brownish or orangey hue will be more or less indistinguishable from the colour of foliage. This is, of course, why most mammals are brown, and why primates are the most colourful mammals:

Now, some bonus fun facts. Marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, whales, dolphins and so on are in fact monochromatic \- all their cone cells are the same, so instead of perceiving different colours, they simply detect the intensity level of light. Water, being dense, tends to scatter and absorb longer wavelengths of light, so there’s not much reason to have good colour vision.

There are even mammals which are naturally tetrachromatic, which have four different cones - reindeer. Up in the Arctic, the sun may stay in the sky for a very long time, so objects end up absorbing a lot of ultraviolet radiation. Due to their tetrachromacy, reindeer are very sensitive to UV light, and thus food sources like lichen contrast starkly against white snow, which reflects the radiation.

Anyway, to summarize my answer to your question: while there are certainly many green animals, you don’t often see green mammals because they (and their predators) usually struggle to distinguish brownish colours from the colour of plants. This is because most mammals detect red and green using the same type of cone cell in their eyes.

Thanks for reading, have a great day.
