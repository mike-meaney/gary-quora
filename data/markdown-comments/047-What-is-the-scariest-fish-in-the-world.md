The stomiiforms are what immediately jump to mind, for me at least. This is not a single species of fish, but rather a whole order of species, comprising over 400 known types. As you would expect, they all dwell in the deep sea, which means there are probably plenty more stomiiforms to be discovered.

Here are some facts about these creepy critters which will surely convince you that they‚Äôre in the running for the title of world‚Äôs scariest fish. They‚Äôre also really, really interesting!

*   Virtually all species are bioluminescent; that is, they produce light. They do this using rows of organs called photophores, in which the light-emitting molecule coelenterazine reacts with enzymes. These photophores can be beautifully intricate, with lenses, colour filters, specialized muscles and more involved.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-159c2bfe102c1b727d2fb1f32b7d7653-lq)

*   Many stomiiforms, especially dragonfishes (who we‚Äôll see a lot more of shortly) have transparent teeth, which are invisible to potential prey even in the light of bioluminescence. These teeth are also incredibly strong, embedded with tough microscopic crystals throughout.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7b6f5dbfd33e69ad04fdbab822a0c353-lq)

*   The biggest stomiiform, the so-called obese dragonfish, is over half a metre long. This may not sound like much, but it‚Äôs very large for an animal which lives 5 kilometres below sea level, and it is an apex predator in its environment. It gets its mean name from its rather bloated appearance.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-776207237d33eafd9a2957b077857997-pjlq)

*   The larvae of the black dragonfish are very unique, as they have these huge eye stalks, which are themselves half as long as the body. This setup allows the young dragonfish to rotate their eyeballs in practically any direction, so they can watch for predators at all times in their vulnerable developmental phase.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c867721001340b59bfe8eb02bb62a3b2-pjlq)

*   My favourite stomiiform is undoubtedly the freakish stoplight loosejaw. They have no skin below their mouth, hence ‚Äúloosejaw‚Äù, allowing the jaws to lunge out explosively at prey with great speed. Because of this, the incredibly complex structure of the fish jaw is on full display, and they look like veritable alien life forms.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dec7166cdee0fe144437524a7b598fac-lq)

*   The ‚Äústoplight‚Äù part of the aforementioned fish‚Äô name comes from the red light they produce. This is extremely significant; loosejaws and their relatives are the only fish on Earth which can see and produce red light. The stoplight is therefore really an invisible spotlight, which illuminates the environment, but is imperceptible to prey!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4ac0f5ba65cac89a766aae61188929a8-lq)

*   The bristlemouths are the world‚Äôs most numerous vertebrate, by far. These tiny deep-sea stomiiforms exist in unfathomable abundance down in the abyss, and are thought to number in the trillions, or even quadrillions. Also, they are always born male, and later transform into females - this is known as sequential hermaphroditism.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b0ca1f42de9045b16b4f457a3e77f701-pjlq)

*   The hatchetfishes are another strange and unique group in this order. Their bulging eyes are permanently angled upward, as they use the faint light from the surface to detect the silhouettes of potential victims overhead. To camouflage and avoid falling prey to the same strategy, they utilize counter-illumination - luminous underbellies.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5bf44d24108f1378ac7cd5953ac604e9-pjlq)

*   In addition to having black skin from head to toe (or head to caudal fin, I suppose), some dragonfish have a black stomach lining inside them. This blocks out the bioluminescence of the fish they swallow, which might give away their position to predators and would-be prey alike.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4edfde0f8a673df32ea16cf6e5c1bb27-lq)

*   Speaking of such colouration, the aptly named Pacific blackdragon is one of the blackest organisms in the world - its scales, which are densely packed with melanosomes, absorb 99.5% percent of light which hits them. Perhaps I shouldn‚Äôt be telling you this‚Ä¶ maybe [Anish Kapoor](https://www.thecollector.com/vantablack-anish-kapoor-stuart-semple-controversy/ "www.thecollector.com") is the only person allowed to write about this fish.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7a2d56ebd2340745257dd4541c1677d5-lq)

*   One species of stomiiform, Bathophilus indicus, has fangs on its tongue. These help it snag slippery fish, and they angle backwards, so their grip is near impossible to escape. It should come as no surprise to you that, being an overdramatically horrific creature, B. indicus lives in Australia.

So, those are twelve facts about the stomiiforms which should highlight just how bizarre and spooky they really are. Even still, when it comes to deep sea life, they‚Äôre about as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù as it gets! Thanks for reading, have a great day everybody.

Wow. I thought the first picture was clickbait, but I‚Äôm glad I clicked it and learned something amazing today. Thank you for taking the time to create such a high quality answer.

By the way, I feel like an obese dragonfish the days after I eat too much. But that‚Äôs not even scary on your scale!
```

```
That was an epic answer. I am very glad not to be a fish that has to share the oceanic volumes where these live.
```

```
Now this is an answer worthy of the old Quora. I come to this site to learn about things like this - things I never thought about until suddenly coming across it. Knowledge for knowledge‚Äôs sake! I knew about some of these fish, but the expansiveness of this answer (and the pictures!) just blew me awa‚Ä¶
```

```
Deep subject! Superb survey of this fascinating order. Thanks.
```

```
Gary, I‚Äôm not EVEN interested in fish stuff but this was a great read. I looked at it all briefly and then your ‚Äúcredentials‚Äù and now I gotta get back to these mesas in South America.
```

```
I love how even when it comes to deep sea horrors such as these, we Aussies still have one for ourselves that is particularly horrifying.
```

```
Really interesting! Some of them bring to mind the creature from the Alien movies, and I wonder if the appearance of these fish had some influence on the design.
```

```
Great answer! Stomiiforms are truly the stuff of nightmares. The loosejaws left me speechless. Mother Nature‚Äôs fabulous range of life forms runs very deep indeed.
```

```
Honestly the biodiversity of the oceans is pretty amazing. Orcas, cuttlefish, octopi, stromiiforms, jellyfish, ‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre all so cool.
```

```
Wow! ‚ÄúHow to Tame Your Dragonfish‚Äù is NOT a movie. My jaw is loose, reading your answer‚Ä¶
```

```
Great answer! One question though: Why do you say B. Indicus live in Australia? I thought these creatures you describe live very deep into the ocean?
```

```
Beyond fascinating. I knew about bioluminescence in fish but had never heard of the stormiforms before. I love learning new things like this.
```

```
Please tell me they live deep deep even deeper down in the ocean üòÅü§î
```

```
Very cool.

What is the mechanism of bioluminescence in these animals?
```

```
Fascinating. Should the human race successfully destroy the ecosphere at the surface and remove itself from the planet, will these deep-sea monsters evolve into the niches left?
```

```
Fascinating!üéá
```

```
Where is that pesky double upvote button.

Had no idea about the bristlemouths.
```

```
Fascinating and terrifying in equal measure.
```

```
Awesome answer man! The deepest sea seems almost like another planet to me. Fascinating.
```

```
If the Pacific Blackdragon came to blows with Anish Kapoor over this black thing, I know who would win!
```

```
Thanks for sharing this! Nature is pretty wild, especially down in the deep sea. Kind of makes me wonder what life on other worlds/moons could be like.
```

```
Have an extra upvote for the zing on Anish Kapoor! Nicely done
```

```
Nature can be truly scary! Deep sea evolution is an amazing and mind boggling thing. Thank you for this information. The stop light loosejaw is absolutely horrendous!
```

```
Thank you for this. Fish from the ocean‚Äôs abyss are truly fascinating.
```

```
Dear Gary,

I always read and LIKE your contributions. You are a treasure trove. Thanks and keep at it.
```

```
Holy hermaphrodism!

Gotta hope the bristlemouths are more attractive after they transition to female!!!
```

```
I‚Äôm sure my day will be fine, but I may have trouble sleeping!
```

```
Thank you so much for your answers, they are fascinating, interesting and easy to understand. I particularly like the Kapoor reference, made me laugh!
```

```
Multiple upvotes if I could. Thanks for sharing
```

```
I will never go in the ocean again.
```

```
Fantastic. Really nice writing style. Fascinating topic.
```

```
"Have a great day?" Seriously? After enhancing our nightmares‚Ä¶?
```

```
Absolutely awesome answer as always!
```

```
Cool and creepy!
```

```
My goodness! They are ghastly.
```

```
Thankfully, all of these fish are no more than a couple feet long.
```

```
The deep sea is an insane environment because very little changes environmentally down there. All of the wacky abominations we see are actually hyper-specialised over billions of years of evolution.
```

```
The diversity of life in the oceans is ‚Äúunfathomable‚Äù.
```

```
Mind you, not quite so scary when you realize most are only a few inches long.
```

```
Wow! Amazing insight into this strange world‚Ä¶ Thanks!
```

```
So there really are monsters. My nightmares will take a whole new direction tonight!

But seriously, a great response - just the kind of well made stuff I look for and upvote.
```

```
Hi Gary very interesting answer, it makes me think about Darwinism. I believe in the kind of evolution people call micro evolution, the evolving beaks of finch‚Äôs in the Galapagos for example, but I don‚Äôt believe in the theory that the first living cell spontaneously popped into existence and then ra‚Ä¶
```

```
Enlightening look at monsters from the deep.
```

```
So THAT‚ÄôS where the dinosaurs went!
```

```
I had to laugh at your description of the last fish - yeah, we Aussies can be epic in our evil!!!
