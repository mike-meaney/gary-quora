## The Fossils That Walk Among Us

A “living fossil” is essentially an organism which is an evolutionary holdover from a lineage which is, otherwise, long extinct. The most famous examples are the likes of coelacanths and horseshoe crabs; however, there are many more which I doubt you’ll have heard of.

As I’m partial to mammals myself, I’ll be discussing some of the most interesting mammalian living fossils here. First of all, we have the rather adorable Amami rabbit, which is found only on two tiny Japanese islands.

As you can probably see, it looks quite strange for a rabbit, with very short ears and small eyes. Amami rabbits are nocturnal, sleeping in caves during the day, and they have large claws for digging and even climbing. In fact, this species is so distinct that it’s thought to belong to a primitive lineage of rabbits which were once found from as far as Slovakia to China.

Even more ancient, however, is the Laotian rock rat. When it was discovered in Laos in 2005, it seemed so distinct that it was placed in its own family. However, its discoverers did not think to compare it to fossil rodents, and a year later, it was found that it actually belonged to a rodent family known as Diatomyidae.

However, the diatomyids were thought to have gone extinct some 11 million years ago! To this day, there has been no fossil evidence of them found in this eleven million year gap, and the Laotian rock rat has been nicknamed the “coelacanth of rodents”. It is also known as the rat-squirrel, because it resembles a cross between the two creatures in many respects.

The only other living fossil among the mammals which has such a big gap in its fossil record is the monito del monte. This little marsupial, found in the bamboo forests of Chile, has an entire taxonomic order to itself - Microbiotheria. The microbiotheres once roamed much of South America, Australia and even Antarctica, and emerged shortly after the extinction of the non-bird dinosaurs. Today, though, only one species remains.

There are two main groups of marsupials; the Australian marsupials (found in Australia, New Guinea, parts of Indonesia etc.) and the American marsupials (found in North and South America). However, despite living in Chile, genetic studies show that the monito del monte is, in fact, an “Australian” marsupial.

This confirms something which had long been suspected to be true - that marsupials first evolved in South America, not Australia, and crossed over to the latter via Antarctica. Speaking of marsupials, the last species I’m going to mention is called the musky rat-kangaroo.

This is the world’s smallest macropod - the group that includes wallabies, kangaroos and quokkas. It’s also much more primitive than any other macropod, as it walks on four feet, has five toes, and is an omnivore rather than a herbivore. In fact, you could almost call it a living transitional fossil, as these characteristics are associated with the possum-like ancestors of the other macropods.

The musky rat-kangaroo’s genus, Hypsiprymnodon, dates all the way back to the Oligocene Epoch, and is the only living species in the family Hypsiprymnodontidae. The hypsiprymnodontids were once much more widespread in Australia, and even included large, carnivorous species! However, as the continent became drier, they died out, with the last species confined to a small sliver of rainforest in Queensland.

So, those are four different species of mammals which seem as time travellers from prehistory who have been stranded in the present day. Thank you everyone for reading, I hope you all enjoyed.

Good to see the musky rat kangaroo getting some love. I saw one on a wildlife day tour in Queensland.
```

So are the Laotian Rock Rat & the Monito del Monte pretty good examples of the kinds of mammals alive when the dinosaur-killing asteroid hit?
```

I have pet (petted) monitos del monte. In my childhood, my family and I would spend winter break up in the mountains, and there was this family-owned restaurant that had one. They had found it injured and took care of it. They are nocturnal and do not make great pets, because of their skittish natur…

Do you know these animals off the top of your head, or do you spend weeks researching? Your answers are amazing!

Absolutely astonishing!

It’s soooo easy to forget that mammals coexisted with dinosaurs for millions of years, and that there must be SOME that fell into the same boat (so to speak!) as the coelacanth!

Very informative and interesting answer. Thank you so much for sharing your knowledge.

Thank you very much Gary, I knew of none of them. Really good pictures also, the “rabbit” is awesome. OMG I used that word, shame on me!
```

Gary, this is the first I’ve encountered of the notion of marsupials originating in South America and moving to Australia via Antartica. I’m hoping you have more to say about this. I just went to your profile and - oh my - every single entry is fascinating.

I love learning about new( to me) species! Thank you for the post and photos!

thank you for the lesson. I did enjoy reading that.
```

```
That rabbit looks like a pika, interesting
```

```
Thoroughly enjoyed. Thank you❤️
```

```
Fascinating answer!
```

```
So would humans count as living fossils, if no one from our genus still exists?
