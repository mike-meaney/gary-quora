One of the most grim and brutal initiation rites in the world is that of the Sateré-Mawé people of Brazil. To become a man and a warrior, a boy must endure hundreds of stings from bullet ants.

Bullet ants are the only species in the world with a score of “4-plus” on the Schmidt Sting Pain Index, which goes from 1 to 4. A single sting is described as causing “pure, intense, brilliant pain . . . like walking over flaming charcoal with a three-inch nail embedded in your heel."

In preparation for the rites of passage, countless bullet ants are rendered unconscious by a natural sedative. They are then woven into a pair of oven mitt-like gloves, 80 in each, with the stinging abdomens facing inwards. After the sedative wears off, the terrible ritual is ready to begin.

The boy must slip on the gloves and keep them on for a full five minutes, while singing and dancing, and maintaining his composure. For the next few days, he may shake uncontrollably, and parts of his forearm and hand will probably be paralyzed from the venom.

The worst part? Over the next months, the boy will have to endure these five minutes of agony 20 times! Only then will he be considered a man.

So, kids - if you think your life is hard, at least you don’t have to experience the most painful sting known to mankind hundreds, if not thousands, of times, over. The Sateré-Mawé are the definition of hardcore.

To be honest I think I’d rather just stay a child forever than do that and become a man
```

```
How old are these kids? How do we not all look at this and see child abuse?
```

```
I can barely breathe at the thought! Kind of makes up for childbirth. Unless, of course, there’s another initiation for girls…
```

```
Holy fuck.

I knew a guide who’s been bitten by a bullet ant (one!) and he said it was so painful that no available painkiller could stop it
```

```
To get an real appreciation, watch white guys try to go through the same five minutes just once on YouTube. They scream like middle school girls. Not that I would necessarily fare any better
```

```
When you keep selecting for toughness like that, you’ll eventually have to keep one-upping each generation until you get to such absurd levels.
```

```
“…like walking over flaming charcoal with a three-inch nail embedded in your heel.”

I know exactly what you mean.
```

```
That’s badass.
```

```
Why do people get so upset that an indigenous tribe figured out that the real proof of being a man is stoically undergo severe pain?

I wonder if this is where Frank Herbert came up with the agony box in Dune…
```

```
I read that only those who wanted to be respected and to be proclaimed as the strongest warrior will have to repeat the ritual 20 times.

At least it feels good to know that after the first time, the mandate is lifted off.
```

```
And what have these men achieved in life? How have they contributed to taking mankind forward?
```

```
I actually watched this on discovery once when I was younger. And all of this is ignored because it's some “tribal ritual”. For fucks sake this this child abuse!
```

```
Sometimes a short-timed enduring and thus transcendence of pain is easier, than a long lasting fear of the fear. Why are modern people plagued by anciety, depression, and pills? Moreover, why are so many people nowadays in so many ways not growing up?
```

```
Lot of times we underestimate or totally disregard the logic of such actions by unknown cultures and tribes.I would imagine, given a chance one should go and ask these tribes about such logic.
```

```
I am given to understand that there is a ritual of passage into manhood in which broken bamboo sticks are rammed repeatedly up 12–13 years old boys’ noses to make them bleed profusely. After this ceremony in front of the whole village, they were taken away from their families to live with only other…
```

```
Well, if they want to be pedantic they should wear it on their manhood instead of the hands.
```

```
Oh god I just watched a documentary about this. And we think spanking is child abuse!
```

```
little fire ants are also pretty bad.

Anyway - this is why the USA is more civilized.
```

```
Maybe the tribe hunts in difficult terrain, with ants and insects biting you as you lay an ambush. If any of the hunters were to react to their basic instinct, this might lose the tribe chances of success. So before being allowed to join the hunt, it maybe smart to be trained to endure and control y…

For all the virtuous in the comment section:

No, you can't impose your views of what's considered abuse into other cultures.

No, it's not the same as female circumcision, these ritual doesn't mutilate anybody.

No, pain and suffering are not the same, and yes the difference is both individual and cultural.
```

```
This is brutal child abuse.

Let's not glorify it with politically correct "cultural relativism".

Something went horribly wrong in this society's development, that this was conceived of and permitted.
```

```
Excellent answer! At least from Coyote Petersen’s experience the Executioner Wasp was rated higher than a bullet ant. Well worth watching the sting here (if you can stomach it!) : Coyote Peterson Takes A Sting From An Executioner Wasp, His Most Painful To Date His orgional bullet ant sting :…
```

```
How could this abstruse, recondite and prosaic custom where apart from victim,everyone is exulting with joy, justify the manhood!
```

```
This is child abuse . I don’t care if it’s cultural . Human sacrifice was cultural and that was barbaric too.
```

```
Who would be tougher: them, or the Gurkhas?
```

```
I don’t see the point in this
```

```
Why is such cruelty ignored only because it is an “indigenous ritual”? This is undeniably child abuse.
