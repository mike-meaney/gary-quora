Yes, this is surprisingly common in nature! Here are some of my favourite examples.

First of all, leafcutter ants. Chances are you've heard of them; they harvest blades of grass and leaves, carry them back to the nest in an orderly line, and feed them to underground colonies of fungus, which in turn produce little nutritious blobs (called gongylidia… I love that name) exclusively for the ants.

This symbiosis in itself is very interesting, but another unique thing about leafcutter ants is their polymorphism. The worker ants are divided into four separate castes; in ascending order of size, they are termed minims, minors, mediae and majors. The mediae are the ones who cut and carry the leaves, but you often also see little minims “hitchhiking" on the plant matter.

These hitchhikers house bacteria which secrete antimicrobial chemicals, preventing microbes which would be harmful to the fungus crop from contaminating the leaves. They also defend the carrier below, warding off phorid flies which might attack it. While this behaviour isn't strictly for transportation, I still think it's worth mentioning as it is fascinating.

Another insect which hitchhikes is the helmet cockroach, Helmablatta louisrothi. Termites aside, this species may well be the most bizarre cockroach in the world, and that's really saying something. It dwells in the volcanic caves of Vietnam, and it's instantly recognizable thanks to its helmet, which resembles a halo.

There is a lot I could write about this wacky little guy, like how it grazes on underground fungi, or how it lures potential mates with a scented secretion, how it has the proportionally largest head of any cockroach, how it's flightless but still has wings, or how the males have claws on their back used to hold the female in place during mating.

However, for our purposes, I brought up the helmet cockroach because - being flightless - it will instead hitch a ride on a bat when it wants to travel! Now that's what I call a Batmobile! t even has a special hook on its dorsal side which it seemingly uses to affix itself to the bat's fur.

Now, we go from under the ground to under the sea with slipper lobster larvae.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5e61d59afbcef4d7f829d3e74dbd40a3-pjlq)

Before reaching adulthood, slipper lobsters go through an underdeveloped phase during which they are termed phyllosoma larvae. They are transparent, tiny, and have long spindly legs. All things considered, they’re not the best adapted to swimming long distances.

But they don’t need to, because they invest in personal transportation - unwilling jellyfish. They hop onto the bell of a passing jellyfish, and ride it as it drifts through the depths, sometimes eventually killing it due to the added weight. And if that wasn’t convenient enough, they also begin to chew away at their host, fueling their growth! Unfortunately, the larvae do not have ice cream to accompany their jelly.

I should also mention that when they do grow up, slipper lobsters are still really, really weird…

If that doesn’t look like an alien creature I don’t know what does. You see those broad flaps sticking out of the front of the head? Those are actually its antennae, which have evolved into an unrecognizable form.

Moving on, we have another crustacean, and another outlandish oddball: Phronima. It’s a genus of amphipod, which - as you would expect from a freaky sea beast - lives in very deep waters. There are ten different species.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-831a2200e917f54e0aa24dc2d7fc4bca-lq)

That massive “crest” at the back of its head, which makes it look awfully similar to a Xenomorph, is in fact a massive extra pair of translucent, tube-shaped eyes! And that’s not even the strangest part about Phronima. The hazy blob encasing it is a creature called a salp, which is essentially just an aimlessly-floating, barrel-shaped sack of transparent flesh.

The Phronima pictured above is not using the salp for its own transport, but rather for transporting its young. It has torn out the gelatinous viscera of the poor salp, and will lay its eggs in the resulting hollow, before propelling it away so its offspring can hatch elsewhere, in fresh territory.

Next, let’s take a drastic turn away from this series of nightmarish arthropods and move to something cute and fluffy. Let’s talk about Virginia opossums.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-66482ac16c8722e7489a3a48150ccd3c-lq)

Being marsupials, and in fact the only marsupial species native to North America, baby opossums are born in their mother’s pouch. They spend the first part of their life here as blind, fleshy jelly beans, as marsupial young do not spend as much time developing inside the mother as placental mammal babies.

However, when they grow older, the little opossums often like to ride atop mom’s back while she forages. Up to twenty can fit on one mother! In a similar vein, I should briefly touch on shrews.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-15aa3869f68bd6e711613809657b33fb-lq)

They don’t really ride each other, but baby shrews do travel in conga lines of up to eight, with the mother at the front, and each child carrying the tail of the shrew ahead in its mouth. Hang on a minute, isn’t there a movie about this? Anyway…

That’s enough adorable furriness for one answer, we have to circle back to marine invertebrate Lovecraftian horrors. As such, I will continue this tangent by introducing Synophalos. Just like the shrews, this extinct, 515 million year old arthropod travelled in connected chains.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d01240b60d50f23c29fbbf2ae5611ed9-pjlq)

Because this species is so damn ancient, and its body plan is dramatically different from that of any modern arthropod, we know very little about Synophalos and its place on the evolutionary tree of life. However, like so much of the Cambrian fauna, we know it was really cool and extremely weird.

That’s all from me, guys, I hope you enjoyed this answer. Thank you all very much for reading, have a good day.

Great answer, but neither oppossums nor shrews can be described as cute or fluffy. Oppossums are essentially lizards with fur, and shrews inhabit a nightmarish hellscape of endless, bloodthirsty hunting and feeding. Some shrews are also venomous, which pushes them more into the reptilian category. I…

Wow, excellent answer!

Absolutely outstanding post, Gary. Never get tired of cases of symbiosis. I’ll bookmark this. I’d like to share it with my students.

I loved the picture of the mother possum with her babies riding on her back. So cute!

I don't know why most people think possums, especially mother possums with piggybacking babies are so ugly and/or icky. Clearly they do not appreciate cuteness and excellent mom behavior.

Wonderful answer indeed! And I learned about a few new creatures.

I will add in scorpions

Such interesting animals. Thanks for this. You didn’t mention the more well-known riders probably because they are too, well, uh well-known. But in case there are any who are not familiar with them, let me add a couple of my favorites: Cattle Egret that I have seen riding on the biggest ride around;…

Loved the answer!!. I would like to add two more here— 1. Remoras — these fish have suckers that they attach to sharks, whales and ray fish to hitch hike from one place to another. These fish also feed on scraps dropped by the sharks and thus keep the sharks free of parasites. 1. Mother Sloth bears carry th…

Awesome answer as always! Love the examples!

Yet another wonderfully informative article from you Gary, thank you. Happy New Year.

So… Them!, Quatermass, Alien… I’m not keen on later horror movies, but it looks like you’ve covered all the great. Superb post.

Batmobile? The correct word is Batwing.. haha just kidding but great answer by the way

I’m not sure I’ll sleep tonight … !

I was told by a marine biologist that riding jellyfish is not only a sliper lobster thing. Apparently large numbers of lobsters do this, and is part of the problem in trying to breed them.
