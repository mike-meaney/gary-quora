## Nose-Leeches Like to Watch Movies Too

Yi-Te Lai is a Taiwanese parasitologist (parasite biologist) who studies leeches. In 2019, while writing a paper on a poorly-understood leech known as Dinobdella ferox, Lai went above and beyond expectations to advance our knowledge of the species.

Dinobdella ferox is a member of the praobdellids, a nasty family of parasites which, unlike other leeches, do not suck blood from the exterior of their hosts. Rather, they attach themselves to the mucous membranes, found inside the body. D. ferox enters via the nose, or worse, the anus, or worst, the urethra.

In order to document the life cycle, habits and symptoms of these nasty leeches, Yi-Te Lai voluntarily inserted one into his nose not once, not twice, but three times! At the time of infestation, each Dinobdella was a few millimetres long:

The worm then stayed in his nasal cavity for as many as 75 days, sucking his blood all the while. He noted effects such as nosebleeds, stinging up his nostrils, and inflammation of the mucous membranes. He took regular blood tests, and frequently monitored his tenant by endoscopy (that in itself is already quite an invasive procedure!)

As each leech gorged itself, it enlarged at a sickening rate. In one of the three trials, it increased in size three hundred and eighty-fold! They were often externally visible towards the end of their stays, due to their size. Hopefully none of them decided to stick their head out while he was talking to peopleâ€¦

Speaking of which, Dinobdella ferox seems to develop a longing for the outside world after itâ€™s done blood-sucking. Specifically, it seeks out damp and dark places. This proved to be awkward in some situations, as theyâ€™d start emerging while Lai was washing his face, showering, or watching a movie at the cinema!

At the end of each trial, after the nosebleeds stopped (presumably meaning the leech had finished feeding), Lai managed to coax his nose-dwelling friend towards the nostril by holding his face over a bowl of water, and then pulled it out by hand.

Many people would be utterly horrified and baffled as to why someone would do this, but I personally have a lot of respect and admiration for Yi-Te Laiâ€™s dedication. Because he voluntarily infected himself with these blood-sucking parasites, we now know a lot about a once-mysterious species.

If my description of the procedure interested you, I strongly recommend you look him up on YouTube, where he posted his observations every step of the way. Thank you for reading, have a great day!

Reminds me of that guy who got stung by a crap ton of bugs just to rank how painful it was and create a metric by which painfulness of bug stings/bites can be measured and compared.
```

```
Ohh, man, yup, thatâ€™s dedication!
```

```
Imagine watching resident evil at the cinema and you look to your side only to see a man with a leech crawling out of his nose.
```

```
If I was sitting next to a stranger at the movies and that thing started crawling out of their nose, I wouldn't get up and move, I'd run tf out of there and call the CDC.
```

Yi-Te Lai is a hero of the human race and a Fist of Science!
```

```
And all of it's 32 brains agreed that he was a peach to the leech, before it'd leach from the nare!

Whups!

Wrong Leach.
```

I seem to remember something similar in Jackass. Not sure they were quite as scientifically rigorous thoughâ€¦
```

```
Fascinating! Leaches help mankind in reattaching limbs by sucking blood and thus helping the vascular system to send fresh blood to the reattached appendage. His research might save someone a lot of grief.
```

```
To be admired but Yuck!
```

```
Thatâ€™s beyond badass ðŸ˜±
```

```
I was shuddering all the whileðŸ˜¨
```

```
*Claps* In honor of his dedication to science, the species should be named after him. He deserves it after that.

The dude could have gotten very very sick. What if the thing had its own parasites? It reminds me a bit about that Australian kid who ate a slug on a drunken dare from he and his friends. Anyway not only did the darn thing have a horrible parasite it had a lethal virus too. After a year in the hospiâ€¦

Was he never concerned with bacterial infectoins? Or the leech laying eggs in there?
