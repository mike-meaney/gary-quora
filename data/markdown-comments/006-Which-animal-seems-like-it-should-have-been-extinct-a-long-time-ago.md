The giant panda. Tireless panda conservation efforts are beginning to work their magic on the species‚Äô population, but it can‚Äôt be denied that the bear doesn‚Äôt do itself any favours when it comes to not going extinct.

Firstly, it has a highly specialized diet, effectively consuming only bamboo, a food source which is mostly just tough cellulose and offers very little in the way of energy, protein or other nutrients. To get its daily calories in, a panda bear must eat up to 14 kg of bamboo, so it spends most of its waking hours feeding (and the remainder defecating, which it has to do around 40 times a day).

And despite all the food they eat, pandas have still had to make compromises in order to be as calorie-efficient as possible. They are slow and sedentary, typically avoiding physical exertion of any sort, and have a similarly slow metabolic rate.

The funniest part about all this is that bamboo can be a perfectly viable dietary staple - countless large animals get by eating only grass, for example, which is similarly low in calories. However, the panda digestive system is terrible at processing plant matter - they still have the intestines typical of their recent carnivorous ancestors.

The gut is very straight and short, so the bamboo passes right through their system before it‚Äôs had a chance to be properly digested. Grazing animals typically have huge, convoluted intestinal tracts, as well as, in some cases, numerous stomachs. The longer the food is in there, the more nutrients you can extract from it.

One unique thing about many bamboo species, especially those found in China, is that they exhibit a behaviour called gregarious flowering - that is, all bamboo plants from a given species will flower, die and regrow simultaneously. This has led to some interesting ([and devastating](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-little-known-connections-between-historical-events-that-seem-to-have-nothing-to-do-with-each-other/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")) historical phenomena, but it also poses a problem for the pandas.

Because all the bamboo shoots of one species in the area might die at once, giant pandas can only live in regions where there are multiple varieties available, as an insurance policy. This is a further restriction inflicted on them by their bizarrely specialized diet.

And all this isn‚Äôt even mentioning their improbable reproductive biology. In the wild, a female will only be receptive to potential mates for a period of 2‚Äì3 days once every year. In captivity, as you may have heard, they are even less likely to breed, and some zoos have had resort to using Viagra and, believe it or not, panda pornography to get them in the mood.

I‚Äôm sure that was the last two-word phrase you wanted to hear on a Sunday evening, so perhaps it‚Äôs best to finish up now. Some creationists have pointed to these biological quirks as evidence of intelligent design (seems like pretty unintelligent design to me), which is of course unreasonable. If anything, pandas are a demonstration that survival and thus evolution isn‚Äôt about being perfect, it‚Äôs about being good enough.

I knew they have to eat a veritable shitload of bamboo a day to get by, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever heard a number before! That‚Äôs a third of my weight! I‚Äôd heard much of this before, but not the stomach part, that they‚Äôve retained the type of their carnivorous forebears. So what keeps them from eating‚Ä¶
```

```
Is it possible for zoos to create, either by GMO or just by injecting the stalks, an enriched bamboo that provides more protein and nutrients?
```

```
Another thing I‚Äôve always thought about pandas that make them highly unlike to succeed as a species is the ratio of size between mother and offspring. A baby panda is about 1/900th the weight of its mother, making it one of the smallest newborn mammals compared to its mother. How on earth moms don‚Äôt‚Ä¶
```

```
Since these bears have perfectly functional plumbing like any other bear, I wonder if there might be a way to teach them to eat other stuff. They do, supposedly, but only little. Even a cow would chew on a carcass of a dead hare, and other ruminants too.
```

```
It kinda makes you wonder why we bother. Maybe we just like the challenge.
```

```
Also, evolution often dead ends, and species go extinct. It's not a given that evolution succeeds.
```

```
So, they're basically persnickety idiots.
```

```
Yes many people do not understand that evolution is not planning anything, that natural ‚Äúselection" in science speak does not mean an actual selection made by mother nature but rather who is left alive long enough to mate, (just like in science a ‚Äútheory‚Äù does not mean a casual hypothesis but rather‚Ä¶

```

```
It sounds like giant pandas have a pretty precarious existence, even before humans.
```

```
The Toronto zoo had a difficult time with bamboo for the pandas. If the pandas didn‚Äôt like the taste of the bamboo, they would just throw it away.
```

```
Awesome post Gary,

Panda porn - hahahahahaha,

Yep, they sure are way to precious about what they eat and who they sleep with.

But they are Uber cool and totally worth all the effort the keepers in China and zoo‚Äôs around the world do for them.
```

```
You had to mention Panda porn did you? One more thing I have to delete from my browser history before my wife sees it.
```

```
Their redeeming features are their cuteness and hefty size, without which no serious conservation effort would've saved them from extinction.
```

```
Very interesting. I'm going to share it.
```

```
Panda pornography can never be unread.
```

```
Despite all these shortcomings, they have a HUGE advantage over several other species: humans consider pandas cute and thus worthy of being saved from extinction.
```

```
Another fascinating article by a very talented writer. Call me a super fan.
```

```
It seems that the panda's evolutionary strategy is to look cute enough for humans to take care of it.
```

```
I enjoyed very much your writing which is packed with facts yet so easy and fun to read through. And the last sentence gives a such powerful lift. üëç
```

```
The only reason pandas actually survive is they have mastered inner peace !
```

```
If pandas weren't cute for human standards, nobody would make all that effort to save this carnivore which lives by eating plants, and is too lazy to even mate.
```

```
Luckily they also evolved an insane amount of cuteness, which has turned out to be a major evolutionary advantage, as it motivates humans to save them from extinction.
```

```
Yeah, the whole sex thing is why I jokingly call them ‚Äúprude-bears‚Äù
```

```
Edit: Minor update. I totally disagree. Before humans arrived the adult panda had almost no predators a huge range and unlimited food. Only a few species have that extraordinary opportunity. The panda‚Äôs ‚Äòweaknesses‚Äô are simply because life was so incredibly easy (basically eating and sleeping) that t‚Ä¶

Pandas fell into a unique niche that natural selection throws up. It‚Äôs not about how everything works, the important part is that it does work, and the species were doing very well before human activity started threatening them. Evolution isn‚Äôt about making sense, or logic. It‚Äôs about which animals s‚Ä¶
```

```
Guess the only evolutionary advantage they have is they're cute so humans feel like they need to be protected.
```

```
One more:

Female pandas don‚Äôt know how to take care of their children after their cubs are born. So the death rate of panda cubs is really high in the wild.
```

```
I‚Äôve also heard that it‚Äôs the bamboo that is actively decreasing their sex drive. The male‚Äôs penis is also pretty small, so even when they do have sex, the chances of conceiving aren‚Äôt great.
```

```
Meanwhile in Koala land‚Ä¶
```

```
Are there any animals with odd physical/digestive/reproductive systems excluding panda and platypus?
```

```
The Australian koala has de-evolved, i.e. shed unneeded genes, to the point where its brain is barely capable of keeping it alive, it eats only one tree (eucalyptus) and only living leaves and must consume its mother‚Äôs feces in order to seed its GI tract with the bacteria that enable it to live. Yes‚Ä¶
```

```
Answer could use some more details on their habitat loss, they were doing quite fine until we showed up, despite their diet.
```

```
Where can I find some of that panda porn? (Asking for a friend.)
```

```
But arguably they have the most effective survival trait in the modern world today - they look so so so cute. Worked, didn't it?
```

```
Well they did evolve to be among the cutest of living things, thereby setting up an insurance for humans to save them from extinction!
```

```
I am so damn curious about this panda pornography. I‚Äôm gonna have to actually look this up on YouTube
```

```
AND, if they have more than one baby, they immediately abandon the weaker one to die. So only fertile 1‚Äì3 days per year and the chance of only 1 baby per year. Insane!
```

```
They do have one thing going for them, and that is cuteness to encourage to help them spread.
```

```
So if they‚Äôre digestive systems are still hardwired to digest meat and not their more recent plant diet then if you convinced s panda to eat meat would it be very nutritious for it or is it impossible for it to eat meat but they are just designed to process that kind of food better?
```

```
Actually the weak are cared for by the strong, that shows intelligent design, also the manure these creatures create are good for the environment, bamboo also cleans dirty water.
```

```
Actually, their survival characteristic is being disgustingly cute.
```

```
It's about being cute enough for humans to feel the need to put effort into conserving your species
```

```
One thing their evolution got right is in being cute and harmless enough for another species like humans to spend this much effort and resources to conserve them. It also helps that anyone caught poaching Pandas is immediately sentenced to death, an approach that could have saved a few white rhinos
```

```
Has anyone tried changing the panda diet? I'm curious how they would respond to a more omnivorous diet.
```

```
They should go extinct already
```

```
How does one find panda porn? Asking for a friend
```

```
Why wait for that small window every year? Just artificially inseminate panda sperm into the female panda as frequent as possible
```

```
Totally agree.
Mother Nature keeps telling us how those dumb animals should be extinct because everything they do doesn‚Äôt make any evolutionary sense.
But we silly humans have decided to save them somehow. :-P
```

```
Thanks for your answer. I am sharing this to a space I created IQ NATURE. Please check it out and follow if you enjoy it.
```

```
Pandas can also eat meat and in the conservation areas animal carcases are left for them to find.
```

```
This the two year old giant panda He Hua. She is so cute. I don‚Äôt want them to distinct.
```

```
What if a zoo or someone who has a panda as a pet feed the panda only fish and fruits ? will it make them more aggressive ?
