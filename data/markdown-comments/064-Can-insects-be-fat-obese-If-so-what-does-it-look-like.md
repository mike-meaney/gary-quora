## Vomit from a Living Larder

Most mature insects have a hard, chitinous exoskeleton which prevents the body from expanding. In order to grow, arthropods have to shed this skeleton and grow a new, larger one. This process is known as ecdysis.

As such, when they enter a caloric surplus, they don’t really get “fatter”, they just get… denser. Insects store fat as droplets of lipids encased inside the cells of a special organ called the “fat body”. These lipids get packed in more tightly as fat is gained.

However, something along the lines of visible fattening can happen to underdeveloped insects, whose exoskeletons aren’t yet so inflexible. Larvae like grubs, maggots and the like put on fat pretty quickly, and can actually enter a diabetes-like condition when this happens in excess.

As a stomach-churning side note, scientists have extracted larval fat and experimented with it as a possible substitute for dairy butter. Apparently, an unpleasant taste was only noticed by test subjects when about 50% of the butter in a cake was replaced by the insect fat.

There are also certain insects which look engorged, “obese” even, but not due to body fat per se. Somehow, I’ve never written about honeypot ants in all my three years on Quora, but today is a good opportunity to remedy that.

Honeypot ants have a special caste of workers called repletes. These living larders are fed on pollen and nectar until their abdomens distend to spherical proportions. During lean times, the other workers tickle the swollen repletes’ antennae, causing them to vomit up the digested food - delicious.

Since I’ve already ruined your appetites with the larval cake tidbit, I might as well go ahead and say that people eat these insects too. The repletes are a common delicacy for some indigenous Australian groups; while most ants taste quite citrusy due to their formic acid, honeypot ants are very sweet, thanks to the nectar within.

So, in short: when most insects put on fat, they don’t change outwardly, they just pack it on more densely. However, larvae with less rigid exoskeletons can get visibly fatter, and other insects do swell up due to food itself rather than stored fat. Thanks for reading, everyone!

Wow, fascinating answer, thanks!

FYI: Diabetic Maggots is the name of my new band, Larval Fat a close runner up.

And I had no problem eating through the entire read. But then I’m not surprised people eat those amazing honeypot ants — they look like deliciously ripe berries.

Oh man, just, the pure unbidden shivers I got seeing that picture of the big fat grub.

What kind is it? Is that a witchetty grub? Or some kind of palm grub?

I've had a weird fixation with honeypots since I was a child. Which led me into eating common UK ants (I did say it was weird). They are an utterly delicious flavour bomb (honeypots) but so sweet, you need either a squeeze of lemon, or, to keep things together, a sprinkle of dried wood ants to give s…

A perfectly disgusting set of facts to share with my grandson, who has reached the proper age to enjoy gross topics! Thank you! Bookmarked!!!

What happens if they get too dense with fat? Do they have like internal damage or something? Also the stigma behind eating bugs doesn’t really make sense. They aren’t really that different than other meats, but have less fat, are easier to farm, and take way less resources to mass produce. They also…

I guess eating shrimp is not much different than eating certain insects.

My anthropology teacher said that of all the adjustments that one must make in integrating to another culture, food/eating choices are the most difficult to adjust to.

The grub part can get worse. “If I haven’t ruined your day enough, you can watch this video of Bear Grylls from Discovery’s Man vs. Wild eating a Hercules Beetle larva to survive. I’d rather die.

Reading about insects at mealtime is the most effective diet I’ve tried so far.

Great answer though!

Are these the same kind of ants that farm aphids to milk for honeydew?

If you want to write really horrible and disgusting alien sci-if, you need to study ants.

Interesting! I never really thought much about how insects deal with excess calories before. That’s really cool!

Publish something Gary! Quora may not be the best use for your talents.

You just killed my night time cravings :(

Is that a whole ass Hercules beetle grub?

Ouch!! You stupid ant, stop biting my dick!

What is the larva that's the size of a human hand? What insect?

I don't see the problem with eating insect vomit; honey is delicious.
