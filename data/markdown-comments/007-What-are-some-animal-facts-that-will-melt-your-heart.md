Baby shrews travel in conga lines.

When a mother shrew wants to take her babies places, one will carry her tail in its mouth, then its sibling will do the same to it, and so on. These “caravans” can comprise up to 7 or 8 shrews.

To be fair, though, they look a bit less cute when viewed from further away. In fact, they can look like huge, dark, furry centipedes:

As a less heart-melting aside, a similar behaviour is known from - of all things - a bizarre marine arthropod from the Cambrian period. Synophalos was a shrimp-like creature which evidently travelled in chains, sometimes twenty individuals long.

Another cool fact about shrews is that their brains shrink by 15% in the winter, so they can survive the food-scarce winter. Anyway, I’m getting distracted - this has been my No. 1 cute animal fact you might not know, thanks for reading.

rat train! rat train! (I am so sorry Quora, I am one of the users dumbing things down here) Oooh but I love a rodent train.

I thought the second picture was a primitive salp or something, creepy o_o

Thanks for the video. I had seen this once and it disappeared into some shrubs before I got a clear look at it, so I've never known for sure what I saw. Now I know, so thanks again!

I ask we can blame Shakespeare for Taming these Shrews.

I just…my brain went straight to the human centipede and now I can no longer look at those adorable rodents the same ever again.

Very shrew-ed!

Yeah, very cute until the shrew in front of you shits in your mouth.

As a kid, I was exactly like shrews. Whenever in a crowded area, I held my mummy’s dupatta (a drape worn over salwar kameez) to prevent getting lost

Reminds me of that gross Human Centipede movie (don't Google it!)
