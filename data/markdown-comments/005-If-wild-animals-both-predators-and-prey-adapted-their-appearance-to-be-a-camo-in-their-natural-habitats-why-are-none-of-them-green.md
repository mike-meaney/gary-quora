Our perception of colour is different to that of other animals, and that’s important to keep in mind. Take placental mammals, for example. To a deer in a lush forest, a prowling tiger would not appear orange. If it did, it wouldn’t be very good at ambushing its prey.

Rather, the deer would perceive the tiger as the same colour as the surrounding vegetation.

Let’s take a closer look and explain why this is. Humans, of course, are primates, and to be more specific we are part of the Old World monkeys, or catarrhines. Most catarrhines are trichromatic \- in their eyes, they have three different types of cones, which are colour-receptive cells.

These three cone cells detect red, blue and green. If red and green fire at once, the brain interprets that as yellow. All other colours are some combination of the previous four. Because we can distinguish red/yellow (orange) from green, a human or a macaque could see the orange tiger in the green grass.

There are a couple of possible reasons why Old World monkeys became trichromats. It may have been to spot fruit in the trees, or perhaps to notice when one of their peers blushes. Subtle changes in skin tone are one of the many social cues which are important for cooperation in primates.

Reptiles, including birds, are also trichromatic. This is why birds often have such vibrant, colourful plumage, and indeed why there are many green reptiles. That brings me to a second point, which is that there certainly are green animals.

Some of you may now be wondering - given that our reptilian ancestors were trichromatic - why mammals lost one of their cone cells, only to re-evolve it with the Old World primates. The thing is, while trichromacy is obviously great for colour vision, it’s not the best for seeing in the dark. Old World monkeys are all diurnal, so we don’t have this problem.

However, when the first placental mammals evolved, the world was dominated by dinosaurs, which were far larger and hungrier than them. They could only come out during the night, when most of the trichromatic dinosaurs were inactive. They lost one of their three cone cells in order to have improved night vision, and became dichromatic.

This means that they use the same colour receptor for red and green, and thus any kind of brownish or orangey hue will be more or less indistinguishable from the colour of foliage. This is, of course, why most mammals are brown, and why primates are the most colourful mammals:

Now, some bonus fun facts. Marine mammals such as seals, sea lions, whales, dolphins and so on are in fact monochromatic \- all their cone cells are the same, so instead of perceiving different colours, they simply detect the intensity level of light. Water, being dense, tends to scatter and absorb longer wavelengths of light, so there’s not much reason to have good colour vision.

There are even mammals which are naturally tetrachromatic, which have four different cones - reindeer. Up in the Arctic, the sun may stay in the sky for a very long time, so objects end up absorbing a lot of ultraviolet radiation. Due to their tetrachromacy, reindeer are very sensitive to UV light, and thus food sources like lichen contrast starkly against white snow, which reflects the radiation.

Anyway, to summarize my answer to your question: while there are certainly many green animals, you don’t often see green mammals because they (and their predators) usually struggle to distinguish brownish colours from the colour of plants. This is because most mammals detect red and green using the same type of cone cell in their eyes.

Thanks for reading, have a great day.

Are you being serious right now? LOL what the hell is that purple monkey?!

I thought Grape Ape was just a cartoon!

Very cool answer! Why is that tradeoff there in the first place though? I get that retinal real estate is limited, so if you need more rods, you can have fewer cones. But why fewer kinds of cones? Is it just more of a fluke of evolution that this was one way make the trade and it happened to be the…

interesting. I have a friend who’s red/green colorblind and he sees pretty well in low light and also isn’t generally fooled by camouflage. Kind of like the dichromats.
```

```
This is super interesting. So my colour vision is basically like an antelope's and indeed I would perceive a tiger not that different from surrounding grass. Picking berries is also no fun for me - the raspberry is not particularly distinguished from its leaves.

Fantastic answer thanks for sharing all this stuff.

Great write! Some bonus info: “Most birds have retinas with four spectral types of cone cell that are believed to mediate tetrachromatic color vision.” - Wikipedia Most people don’t know that some percentage of humans are fully functioning tetrachromats, allowing them to distinguish hues and colors bet…

Very interesting and informative answer. Something I am glad I read. People like you make Quora a pleasure and makes up for a lot of the dross. Thank you.
```

```
Speaking as a mantis shrimp, I am confused why you mammals even think you have “color” vision.
```

```
Wonderful answer, Gary Meaney. If marine mammals are monochromatic, why do we have such beautifully-coloured fish, kelp, seaweed and so on?
```

```
It's amazing this came up in my feed; I just asked myself the same question a couple of days ago! Based on your answer, though, were homosapien hunters not enough of a threat for mammals to evolve to be green? Or wasn't there enough time for this change before we became farmers?
```

```
That explains quite well why being orange does not hurt tigers, but it raises the question of whether that particular color pattern imparts any evolutionary advantages.
```

```
Wonderful article. I will read it a few more times. Would you consider writing an article about what a pet dog, also pet cat see when they look at their human owners? I sometimes wonder if my dog sees a dark gray cloud when she looks at me.
```

```
One of the best questions and answers I have read on Quora. I assumed all creatures saw colour but it makes sense.
```

```
Can't seem to find the bookmark button. A very intriguing answer. There is something about the way it was written that was more captivating than I would have expected.
```

```
Thanks! I enjoyed learn[ng all of it… actually knew dogs saw colors differently and it had to do with their cone receptors but not all the rest and in the detail you gave.
```

```
This is what Quora should be. Great answer.
```

```
Fantastic answer, Gary! Truly awesome! Thank you for dropping this knowledge!
```

```
Thank you for a very enlightening discussion. My view of the world changed when I realized my dog could hear and smell things I couldn’t, and I could see things he couldn’t, and we lived in different, complementary worlds.
```

```
Great answer. Thanks!

And answers like this are why I read Quora

More very interesting info, Gary, and again, I knew some about animal’s vision and perception of their surroundings but still learned some more, THANKS!

I believe some female humans have four-colour cones as do all (???) howler monkeys.

Amazing answer.

Very comprehensive and educational response, thank you very much!!!

Neglect not the humble sloth. While not able to produce green pigment on their own, they do have a symbiosis with a certain algae, which gives them protective green coloration and makes them harder for things like Harpy Eagles to spot.

Well done. I have only one criticism. Some of what you wrote implies purpose in evolution. There is none, as I know you will agree. I look at it like this. You walk down the street to buy a sixpack. On the way you see on the ground a bearer bond for $100 million. Of course, that changes your future a…

Most birds are tetrachromatic, possessing four types of cone cells — not trichromatic like us.
```

And people who are red/green color blind (like my father) would have trouble seeing a tiger in the grass. He couldn’t tell ripe strawberries from green ones.

But then I wonder about leopards, who like to eat monkeys. It seems they are not very well camouflaged for it?
```

```
Additional fun fact, some humans are tetrachromatic, approximately 29% of women, and no men! They often don't even realize that they're tetrachromatic unless people start to notice that the tetrachromatic women can see far more nuances in color, especially into the indigo, violet, and slightly into…

Among mammals, only a few species of apes see in full color - humans among them.

Is there any way to enable humans to see more colors?

Minor point, Tetrachromacy is commonplace in land vertebrates, with the prominent exception of placental mammals, where it is rare. Many lizard species, for example, are known to be tetra, and as far as I know none has yet been shown to be a trichromat. https://www.nature.com/articles/eye1998143.pdf…
```

```
All of the colors of light that most humans can see can be modeled as a combination of three colors of light: red, green, and blue (the primaries). Yellow is a secondary color in additive color mixing, as you mentioned, so it is not needed in the list.

What a great answer - informative, thought provoking and a good read - thank you!

Some women appear to be tetrachromatic:

Which is why you often see hunters using orange camoflage. We can see it so one hunter can spot another, but the deer can’t see orange.

Well explained. Sir Richard Atenborough gives an in-depth explanation in his Netflix documentary about animal colours, which is fascinating.

Indeed, why are there no green mammals? There are green snakes and green birds, and feathers, scales, and hair are all basically similar structures.

I don’t know, I’ve seen some videos of tigers in tall grass and they blend in surprisingly well even with my Trichromatic eyes.

Another related point I’ve noticed, based on the fur of my outdoor tabby cat, that the wide grey-scale range of colours of ticked fur allows a less-than extremely observant eye to match the surrounding dominant colour, be it grey rock, brown autumn foliage or tree foliage, to the corresponding-inten…

In regards to tigers, could it be that they don’t need camouflage during autumn, winter and early spring - due to heavy Forrest growth…. but they have perfect camouflage during the dry season - exactly when they need it?

This is the kind of question and answer I believe makes Quora make sense.

Interesting, but a bit hard to fully understand for me!

As mammals with colour vision, humans seem to have benefited in the natural selection lottery. At least, in the context of surviving predatory attacks more often.
