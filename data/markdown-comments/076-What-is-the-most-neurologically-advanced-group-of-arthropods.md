Neurological advancement is a very difficult concept to define or measure, and perhaps not even one that really exists. However, what I think you’re getting at is what’s usually vaguely referred to as “intelligence”; in other words, behavioural complexity.

So, which arthropod has the most complex behaviour? The excellent [Ken Saladin](https://www.quora.com/profile/Ken-Saladin "www.quora.com") makes a well-argued case for the wasps in the genus Ammophila in his answer. Here, I will write about an additional candidate for the title: Portia jumping spiders.

Most Portia species live primarily by hunting and eating other spiders, sometimes double their own size. In order to take down their fearsome prey, they employ a wide variety of incredibly complex strategies, indicating that they have some degree of “intelligence”. They even have special tactics for each type of spider they pursue.

If Portia is stalking a web-building spider, it will be extra careful to avoid being spotted, as these targets are extremely sensitive to subtle vibrations they detect on their web. The Portia might take extensive detours up to an hour long in order to find the optimal angle of attack. Amazingly, it will even wait for gentle gusts of wind to tread on the web, masking its movements to the prey.

Another crafty ploy that these jumping spiders use on web-building spiders is mimicry. They sometimes make deliberate vibrations on the web’s silky threads, imitating the struggles of an entangled fly or the beckoning of a potential mate. The victim is lured to its death by these deceptive signals.

One of the most dangerous types of spider that Portia is known to hunt are the spitting spiders, pictured below. The name is an apt one: to dispatch threats, their mouthparts expel twin jets of toxic fluid in a peculiar zig-zagging pattern. This fluid is a combination of silk and venom, which together produce a sticky net to trap unsuspecting prey.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-032a789ca5e16b22b85698ac13bde96e-lq)

When on the hunt for spitting spiders, Portia will always approach from behind, out of reach of the deadly spray. That said, if it’s a mother carrying eggs they seek, they attack head on, because the enemy’s spitting mouthparts are occupied, holding the egg sac.

Occasionally, they go after other jumping spiders. These opponents present their own set of challenges: namely, acute vision. Rather than hunt them down in the open, Portia lie dead still and mimic forest detritus. Only when the jumping spider prey has walked close by do they strike.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9d7d5cf5945dbfdb2708a7a820ace6cf-lq)

One might argue that all these hunting strategies are just pre-programmed instincts that have been wired into them from birth, and not really indicative of intelligence. However, research has shown that Portia spiders have the cognitive capabilities to, when confronted with totally unfamiliar hazards, invent and remember effective new tactics through trial and error.

Portia seemingly even have basic social abilities. One species, P. africana, has been observed in East Africa living in groups and sharing food amongst one another. They are also able to distinguish between the silk threads spun by different individual peers, a trait which might imply some basic form of sociality.

While they may not be on the level of birds or mammals, it can’t be denied that Portia jumping spiders are incredibly intelligent. There are very few invertebrates which come anywhere near them in terms of behavioural complexity and inventiveness. That, I think, is as good a method as any for determining which arthropod is the most “neurologically advanced”.

I just caught a great interview with Sebastian Echeverri on jumping spider neurology. It was dubbed “Kinetic Salticidology” for the “Ologies” podcast. Fascinating stuff.

Jumping spiders are cute and deadly at once. Famous manga artist Masamune Shirow keeps them as pets - and immortalised them in the intelligent, witty and cute Fuchikoma, Uchikoma and best-known Tachikoma (Koma being Nihongo/Japanese for Spider) in his world-famous manga and anime series Ghost in the…

Somebody gets an A+ for those amazing photographs! However, it also occurs to me, that in order to determine that the spiders will wait for over an hour for the breeze to move the web, SOMEBODY is getting PAID to sit there for over an hour, doing nothing! Multiple times! What a racket, heh! I have some…

I rememebr watching a tiny one climbing about in a ficus plant, and swaying gently on the spot as it triangulated its view of the next branch it was going to jump to.

Great answer. I used to have a pet tarantula, a Mexican red-legged spider named Girl. When the previous owner first got her, he put her in a small birdcage and put it on his nightstand. She was in there for several hours and didn’t move at all (typical for tarantulas). He fell asleep on the bed for…

I'm fortunate enough to share my domicile with jumping spiders, nearly year long. They're fascinating to watch, especially when tracking prey! They're about 1 cm in diameter, efficient hunters, and often return my gaze while I'm watching them going about their arachnid bidness. Although I'm bummed to…

Gary, you never disappoint, do you? Great article, as always. I recognized the names of many of the species you mentioned, but wasn’t aware of the behaviors you mentioned. The critter world is so diverse and expansive, I’m so grateful when someone shares something fascinating. Again, my thanks. Best…

Do jumping spiders prey on their own kind or other species of jumping spiders?

A fascinating piece,I’ve recently read Children Of Time which is a novel about Portia and other types of spiders evolving into a technological society after accidentally being introduced to an alien planet.The author has obviously studied them in great depth and has included all these behaviors and…

Magnificently beautiful creatures, and absolutely fascinating! I could not help but be reminded of Pirate spiders while reading your wonderfully composed answer. Thank you for another fantastic read!

Jumping spiders also do a pretty funky mating dance

Years ago I read,in a science magazine, something about how it is thought that their brain capacity is linked to the size their eyes. Sorry I can't remember more than that. The gist of the article is that they are uncommonly intelligent. I also read that they could mimic mating vibrations by tapping…

So many eyes, and they’re all looking at me! :) Tnx Gary!
```

```
Scary. As an arachnophobe I feel a lot better now I know they’re only 5–7mm long.
```

```
What an amazing animal. I find it incredible that a single species could have evolved so many distinct hunting strategies.
```

```
Fascinating. Thank You.
```

```
wonderful. i enjoyed your work.
```

```
The first picture I can actually look at !! I then made the mistake of opening and scrolling and my phone very nearly took a tremendous flight.
```

Anytime I find a jumping spider outside I let them crawl on my hands and jump from finger to finger before they eventually jump off and return on their way. Their huge eyes are so cute. Does their big eyes mean they are more of a moving predator spider instead of a stagnant waiting spider ?
```

```
And cute as hell.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

A superb answer. My compliments. :)

Can I get superpowers if it bites me?

SF Book by Adrian Tchaikovski (Children of Time, 4.3 on Goodreads) describes evolution of spiders into an intelligent species (among other things). Half of the characters are spiders, from different times in their evolution. The first scene is a female jumping spider, named Portia, hunting a much lar…

I shared your answer, but wanted to come back here and link to Researchers Have Mapped Out How Plants Sense Our World
, which includes a 3 minute video called “Are Plants Conscious,” which is really, really cool.

That first photo is especially amazing — and notice all of its eyes are angled to focus on one spot. That’s just incredible to see!
```

```
We call them Norman, and as long as they don’t get in the bedroom we let them wander the house.

The book Children of Time By Tchaikovsky depicts an evolved future civilization of Portia spiders interacting with a human one. It’s both scientifically accurate and grippingly written.

Focused range of intelligence.

Amazing for such tiny critters.

Fascinating they are such incredible hunters.
