Surprisingly, no. In fact, there‚Äôs a whole zoological term for the act of intentionally causing oneself to explode: autothysis. This behaviour is observed in two different groups of animals - ants and termites.

* * *

Both are eusocial insects, meaning that most individuals do not reproduce, and are thus genetically ‚Äúexpendable‚Äù. It wouldn‚Äôt make much evolutionary sense for a normal animal to go around blowing itself up instead of passing on its DNA, after all.

A couple of ant genera use autothysis. The workers of these ants are full of highly corrosive sludge, which they use to their advantage while in combat with rival colonies. When they contract their abdomens, their whole body ruptures, and the substance oozes out.

Of course, they die in the process, but for the greater good of protecting their colony. The yellow goo they release burns any enemy which touches it, and is also very sticky, meaning any other foe which walks in it thereafter may get stuck and perish.

Autothysis is even more widespread in termites, as it is a feature of many species. However, they apply the strategy a little differently. In the case of an attack on the colony, soldiers (or, in some cases, workers) stand at each entrance and rupture their bodies. Their carcasses block all the tunnels into the nest, providing a defensive barrier against the onslaught of rival termites.

One species, Neocapritermes taracua, takes things up a notch by combining the tactics of both ants and other termites. When the workers get old, they become poorly suited to their original duties - ultimately, they are worth more dead than alive.

Copper crystals start to form in a pouch on their abdomen, a deadly backpack, if you will. When the termites self-destruct, they react with chemicals produced by the labial glands to form toxic molecules called benzoquinones.

So, those are two different types of animals which deliberately blow themselves up to protect their colonies. As a fun aside, I‚Äôm going to introduce you to a plant which explodes, too: Himalayan balsam. Native to the world‚Äôs highest mountain range, it is now considered an invasive pest in many countries.

In order to spread its offspring to new pastures, Himalayan balsam seed pods burst open when ripe, if they are disturbed. Seeds go flying up to seven metres in all directions!

Anyway, that‚Äôs all from me for today guys. I hope you enjoyed this shorter-than-usual answer, have a great day!

I‚Äôve never read anything about it, but I‚Äôve paid close attention to the grasshoppers here somehow exploding at the end of the season, after a couple of weeks of nonstop sex.

I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it! (Well, except in fuller detail, since I do have an answer about it.)

How are the ants protected from the goo inside their bodies when it‚Äôs inside?

Is the goo the result of a chemical reaction between two precursors, neither of which is toxic by itself? If not, and the goo is directly excreted by some cell, how is that cell not killed by the goo?

My grandmother used to grow the exploding plant, or a close relative of it‚ÄîImpatiens balsamina or Impatiens noli-tangere. I. balsamina is native to India but widely grown as a garden flower, and there are some native North American Impatiens that do the same trick (explosive dehiscence). The common‚Ä¶

I wonder if exterminators can remove termites from a house by finding a chemical signal that would stimulate them to self-destruct.

Sweet merciful crap! Animals that voluntarily explode? Don‚Äôt let on about this or they‚Äôll have kittens down at the spontaneous combustion conspiracy headquarters.

Man, I thought this only happened in StarCraft! I had no idea such critters actually existed.

The ants sound like a tiny xenomorph from Alien. Acid for blood. They explode and turn themselves into their own ant trap. I love nature. Full of amazing surprises that folks like you are willing to take the time to share. Thanks!

So basically the blue workers of Neocapritermes
 carry around binary nerve agents? (The toxicity of p-benzoquinone on the central nervous system of the cockroach

I call them Kamikaze ants

Those ants are radical. We had a type of balsam growing around home when I was a kid. I've seen the pods blow up and shower the seeds. It propagated prolifically.

And still they say it's all intelligent design! Thank you for this post. E very day should be a school day. But exploding self sacrificing ants and termites that's a new one to me!

That is one of the more fascinating things I‚Äôve read in a while. The genetically expendable ants blow themselves up to protect the colony. Cool.
```

```
‚ÄúCopper crystals start to form in a pouch on their abdomen,‚Äù That is very interesting, do you have a reference for it?
```

```
If the dead termites block the entrance to the colony, how does the conflict end?

the invading force will probably try to dig through right?

This was really cool all the same

Short, but very informative thanks.

Interesting stuff.

Now that's occupational commitment!

This is weird, because afaik ants aren't related to termites? But their evolutionary convergence is mind-boggling!

I have a question for you unrelated to the ant explorers but one that has ‚Äú bugged‚Äù me since the ‚Äò70‚Äôs traveling in the Napo River rain forest in Ecuador close to Peru‚Äôs border.

Spanish broom has exploding seed pods too. Himalayan Balsam is utterly hideous and should have more emphasis on its eradication by the authorities in the UK. It is killing our nature.
