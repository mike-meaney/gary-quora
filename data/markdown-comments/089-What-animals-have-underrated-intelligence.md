I was going to say hyenas, but that’s taken, so allow me to present you an altogether more different and alien organism. Technically, it’s not an animal, but I doubt you’ll mind.

Pictured above is Physarum polycephalum, also known as the “many-headed slime”, a type of protist, and, specifically, a slime mold. The term “slime mold” doesn’t refer to a specific single group, but it is a broad term for several kinds of eukaryote which behave similarly.

Anyway, Physarum has - astonishingly - a basic form of intelligence, despite having no brain and only comprising a single many-nucleic cell. Here are some of the amazing things this slime can do.

*   It can solve mazes. A P. polycephalum placed in a plastic maze will extend forth hundreds of tendrils, exploring all possible paths until it finds one which leads to food. It then retracts all the tendrils leading to dead ends. Moreover, it knows which way is quickest. If there are multiple routes to the reward, it’ll retract the (even slightly) longer one.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-070a8b370df777bec11211233923506d-lq)

*   It remembers. When the mold is solving a maze, it leaves behind a trail of slime wherever its tendrils reach. Using this slime, the Physarum avoids the paths it has already taken. This is essentially a creative, albeit rudimentary, analogue to memory - one that is in external, material form.
*   It mimics transport networks. A P. polycephalum was placed in a plastic enclosure the shape of Tokyo, Japan. Bits of food were placed where the major transport hubs would be in real Tokyo, and the slime mold - knowing which ways were fastest, created a replica of the city’s rail networks using its tendrils.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f44a2c184f6d2190e858655acfa1d928.webp)

*   It learns and keeps track of time. A team of scientists - including the one who did the maze experiment, put this slime mold into a long groove, letting it move along the groove. However, every 30 minutes - they decreased the temperature and the humidity (slime molds thrive in hot, moist conditions). The mold slowed its pace to use less energy. After a while, the scientists stopped. Sure enough, the polycephalum kept slowing every 30 minutes, showing it could both learn and keep time.
*   It’s a healthy eater. Another experiment had the slime molds in the middle of a circular clock face. At each mark in the clock, a different food was placed. However, some of them were made up of the healthiest ratio of carbs to protein, while others weren’t. All of the slimes selected the optimal foods.

An astonishing organism if there ever was one. So unusual that this creature is so obscure, for it certainly has some amazing stories to tell.

A dauber wasp in Indonesia purposefully made friends with me, moved into my house, would ask to be let out by buzzing in a circle around my head, would ask to be let in by tapping on the window,.

What a wonderful answer, I copied it to my feed and got over a thousand views which should have gone to you. I like it especially because it gives me hope that my personal view that the concept of consciousness has to be broadened, that we do not generate it but only articulate it at a fairly high,…

This is the kind of answer that makes a Quora a terrific experience.

Damn, this is one if the most illuminating articles I’ve read in a long time, anywhere. Bravo!

Apparently, literally a piece of slime has better eating habits than me, is less lazier and happens to be superior at playing video-games. Thanks for the uplifting information.

Scientists are also using slimes to solve old mathematical riddles using a method similar to the maze experiment mentioned in the OP. In one experiment they used slime to solve the “traveling salesman problem,” a time- and resource-intensive task even for modern computers. Apparently biological comp…

never heard about it. but it was certainly amazing. thank u for sharing
```

```
Fascinating post, wonderful, great, interesting, funny, impressive, educational and not a bit about another yellow slime ball we know.
```

```
This is so damn cool. I have slime growing in the ground floor side of my shop that I can’t bare to destroy because it’s so interesting to look at. Now I’m even more fascinated.

Perhaps I should experiment.

You were going to say hyenas. Given our shared love of spotted hyenas, thought you might be interested in my attempt to “hunt” the Israeli-Palestinian conflict hyena-style by drawing analogies to the peace process in Ireland, pushing boundaries, being persistent, building coalitions and mobbing. It’…

Fascinating!

Only on quora would I be up-voting a post on slime. Great answer, thanks for the information. Its good to learn something new.

Given how much children love slime, it's a matter of time before one brings some to school.

And their classmates will bow.

And they shall tell that child that they win the right to determine play time games for life.

Technically, it’s not an animal, but I doubt you’ll mind.

Audience taken for granted? Sold!

It would be interesting to apply this technique to a sufficiently large forest — though it could take years.
```

```
Doesn’t a forest fire also only travel where it “finds” food and does it not also not take the same path twice?
```

```
Absolutely blown away! I want one. Where can I get one?
```

```
Fascinating, for sure.

But what’s more fascinating is there’s a scientist somewhere who thought to grow mold in a maze and study it.

You can’t make that up.

```
It seems like a massively parallel computer, each cell acting like an agent.

I seriously doubt it can ever match a traditional computer though. Even for these kinds of problems.

Mind thoroughly blown!!!

Fascinating! There are organisms in nature that display primitive properties of organs in our bodies. Even our mitochondria have their own genetics. While at an exhibit on jellyfish, I noticed that they pulse like our hearts. Soon after that, I met a cardiologist and she confirmed that the cells are v…

This is mind boggling. This mold would make an excellent computer algorithm to find the most efficient path to a destination.

I think we’d all be better off having this type of slime in the White House.

Interesting that it solves a maze the same way a quantum computer would—by trying all the possibilities at the same time.

Apparently (one of my lecturers studies a ‘slime mould’ called Dictyostelium) they changed the term ‘slime mould’ to ‘social amoeba’ last year (as of 2018) (I repeated his course and it was called a slime mould last year).

Amazing answer! Thank you. Answers like this remind me why I am still on Quora.
```

This is reminding me how much I would love to do experiments with random creatures I find in the wild.

If only I had my own mega-laboratory…

This is astonishingly interesting.

So can you then use this organism for effective infrastructural planning? Because if so that would be ground breaking.

The last point should be cloned into humans.

I’ve said this before and I’ll say it now again. Answers like these are why I lik Quora.

I wrote my (college) senior biology midterm on plasmodial slime molds, it was my favorite!

My favorite part was how they can bond together into “slugs” that move much faster than the indevidual cells.

Protozoa are also known to alter the brains of infected animals, to their benefit. That is fucking creepy.

Think of the horror movie possibilities.

Really, who doesn’t need to know about this? Hands down the most fascinating thing I’ve read today. What an amazing world we live in!

It’s only a matter of time until someone says, “where can I get one”.

Throws the whole idea of even rudimentary consciousness into question — illusion? Emergent phenomenon? Undefinable?

Fascinating. So if it doesn’t have a brain, how does it do the brainy stuff? I love this.

These are some of my favourite “animals”.

Wow, this is so interesting! Thanks for teaching me something new today = )

I am going to be far more respectful when I open my refrigerator from now on. Just in case. Fascinating answer. Thanks.

Answers like this are what interested in Quora in the first place.
```

That is so fascinating! Thanks for sharing! :)
```

If I recall correctly, it is even able to teach others of its kind to navigate a maze.

And they seem to really like oatmeal :)
```

```
Scary fascinating! Where can I get one for a pet? I keep losing my keys.

I met one in a bar once.

Fascinating.

I have read extensively about this. I get amazed every time!
```

So obviously all knowledge doesn’t come from the brain.
```

I think slime mold is smarter than some humans!

I love slime moulds.

I learnt a little about them at university and was hooked straight away.

So what I gathered. Is we can solve logistical problems by drawing shapes, marking our needed “nodes” with food and then letting this mold do it’s thing.

It’s almost like analog quantum computing.

This is remarkable.

I saw a puzzle with 3–4 years on it. I solved it in 3 days. Who’s more intelligent now, huh?

Wow. Suddenly, calling someone a ball of slime sounds like appreciation.

THAT is absolutely astounding and begs the question as to what intelligence is and how it is applied

Amazingly, we need more slime in Congress. Can’t believe I wrote that. Nope. Not a retraction.

Many times people wonder how can intelligence come out from dumb ingredients. The answer is; all you need is large numbers with binary connections + time. The example I normally use is the neural networks in building engineering systems. This is another even more brilliant example… thank you.

When the slime mold runs out of food, it will form a pseudopod and walk away “looking” for food. Then it may disperse to eat. Strange critter.

Slime moulds are amazing organisms! My field is neuroscience, so I have a natural interest in biocomputing, and slim moulds are simply amazing in terms of looking at just how comprehensive even bare bones stimuli responses can be.

This organism could be the solution to many of our problems in future. Like for simulations of all kind. I hope we soon will be able to use its abilities fully to our advantage.

I’ve been fascinated by slime molds since I saw the movie the blob as a child. Thanks for spreading the word

Aren't bobs or blobs same as these slimes?

I remember reading similar experiments with a organism called blob

I wouldn't call this intelligence per se. It comes across to me as more of a response to external stimuli. You mentioned how it goes slowly when there wasn't enough food materials. That doesn't come across as intelligence to me.
