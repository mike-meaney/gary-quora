In my opinion, that honour goes to the domestic pigeon. In the 10,000 years since their domestication, the birds have been selectively bred into countless bizarre forms, collectively known as “fancy pigeons”.

Ever wondered if there was a pigeon with the erectile fan-shaped tail of a turkey? Probably not, but check.

What about a pigeon with a huge puffy crop? Check.

Bug-eyed pigeons? You guessed it, check.

In a way, it saddens me that we’ve practically engineered these natural creatures to suit our strange desires. At least they’re not unhealthy, though - unlike so many poor dogs, especially purebreds.

Yep. My guess is that, since pigeon breeding is such a niche thing, only dedicated breeders breed these types of pigeons. Because of this, the pigeon breeds are much healthier than a lot of dog breeds.

Kind of ironic, considering how much more bizarre the pigeons look.
```

The non existent beak pigeons cannot raise their own young. Breeders replace their eggs with normal beaked pigeons'. So step parents raise their chicks. They cannot even reproduce on their own. As you mentioned I always think if we have a right to alter the animals according to our joy even this cost…

Someone I know keeps pigeons and they told me that those practically beakless pigeons have trouble feeding their young. They eat fine on their own though. They raised many of the pigeons you posted here and I had the chance to see them in real life. Those pigeons with giant crops look surprisingly no…

My mom has several types of those pigeons, including the parka hoodie ones. I always wonder whether they can see me peripherally though.

Let us not forget roller pigeons, bred to take short seizures and plummet mid-flight
```

```
Spectacular birds…

This is what Quora is for.

Thanks for your sharing. I didn't know that there are the pigeons with such the fantastic looks.
```

```
For some reason every time you said check I was thinking you were saying like check this out, but in a cooler way. It was pretty funny
```

```
They may be healthy now, but I’m sure a few decades down the line they’ll be suffering in their pretty little feathers just like all our dogs and cats :)

EPIC POST

Australian native crested pigeons will bow and fan their tails in a courting gesture. Does that count?
```

```
Not knowing otherwise, I would have first-guessed that #5 and #6 have either a cancer or an avian Elephant Man Disease, and that the last one is lacking part of a brain (is it blind?).
```

```
If they can do all this, how soon before they can breed a pigeon to look like a dinosaur?
```

```
They aren't unhealthy as modern dog breeds? I thought that the inbreeding needed to achieve those forms would lead to homocygosity and the accumulation of deleterious genes. Maybe the inbreeding is not that strong? There are mechanisms to preserve genetic diversity? Do you know of some literature that y…

Well, chicken are not far behind (if any):

How about tumbler pigeons? We have five of them at the camp farm. (I have it from a reliable source that the younger kids get a kick out of them, not literally.)
```

```
Darwin described in his Origin of Species how such diverse forms of pigeons wouæd have offspring that reverted back to something resembling their natural shape and color.
```

```
The first one is my fave, although the Liberacci Pigeon is a close second.
```

```
The fifth one is like: “kill me, please!”
```

```
Wow, what a variation!

Gets me thinking, would it be possible to ‘recreate’ the Dodo?
```

```
Now I’m super curious why these have been bred to be these ways.
```

```
Never seen a bird before with literally four wings.
```

```
Apparently pigeons are tasty creatures I couldn't believe the mass murder of the passenger pigeon right down to the very last one.
