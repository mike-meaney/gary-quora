A strong contender, in my view, would be the black swallower.

Relative to its overall size, this grotesque fish has the largest stomach of any animal. It lives as many as 2.7 kilometres below the ocean surface, and at those kinds of barren depths food is very hard to come by.

Because of this, if you happen to catch a meal, then you‚Äôd better not waste any of it. To solve this problem, the black swallower evolved a bizarre, elastic stomach which can swell to many times its original size. You can‚Äôt get full if your belly is unfillable, after all.

The feeding feats which this fish can achieve are mind-blowing. It‚Äôs able to swallow fish ten times its size whole! Of course, having a big stomach is no use if you can‚Äôt get your prey in there in the first place. We still don‚Äôt know how exactly the swallower swallows, but the prevailing theory is that it ‚Äúwalks‚Äù its jaws over the fish, tail-first.

That‚Äôs not to say that it doesn‚Äôt sometimes bite off more than it can chew. This black swallower below was fished up off the Cayman Islands in 2007. It tried to gobble up an 86 centimetre long snake mackerel; a meal nearly five times its own length! The huge mackerel ruptured the swallower‚Äôs stomach, killing it.

In other instances, the oversized meal will start decomposing before the swallower has finished digesting it. This releases gases, effectively turning the stomach into a balloon which buoys the fish up to the surface. Due to the pressure change, this too results in excruciating death.

This process is actually how most black swallower specimens come to be found by humans. As they live so deep beneath the waves, much about their lifestyle is shrouded in mystery.

The moral of the story: if you overeat, the lunch rotting in your stomach will produce buoyant gases and you‚Äôll float up to the stratosphere and die.

!!! Alright, now you‚Äôre just messing with us!

(Although last night I came pretty close to eating till I floated up and died.)
```

```
If you'd seen me at 10 PM on Thanksgiving, you wouldn't find that fish so amazing.
```

```
even at my heaviest, I was never that bad of an overeater. I just hit the 200lbs lost mark. Take that ya over-eating fishy of the deep.
```

```
wow‚Ä¶ Gary ‚Ä¶you are always dependable for the weird and fantastic ‚Ä¶. thank you
```

```
Yeah, see I was thinking that about two photos in. We are seeing dead ones and they‚Äôre dead because of their over-eating. So it‚Äôs a problem as much as it‚Äôs a solution. What‚Äôs the correct balance? We cannot be sure, it would seem. But we learn the wrong things if we look at this and think it‚Äôs normal‚Ä¶
```

```
Wow, that turned bleak.
```

```
Omg! That‚Äôs bizarre! What‚Äôs worse is the decomposition before the fish even fully digested it!
```

```
‚ÄúIf you overeat, the lunch rotting in your stomach will produce buoyant gases and you‚Äôll float up to the stratosphere and die.‚Äù

Man, if I only had a nickel for every time I heard that as a kid!
```

```
Some of the weird-ass shit in the world makes fantasy look tame
```

```
This creature terrifies me more than that Magnapinna Squid that cameras picked up under an oil rig. Mainly because of the fact that this fish would probably try to swallow that squid‚Ä¶ may God have mercy on all our souls.
```

```
Well this was the weirdest read of the day for sure!
```

```
That‚Äôs how I plan to go, taking in so much of what life offers that I eventually float up and away‚Ä¶
```

```
How did that fish ever fit the mackeral into it's mouth? Does it's jaw unhinge, like a snake?
```

```
Okay, that is now burned into my long-term memory. Just‚Ä¶. wow‚Ä¶ Thank you for this awesome post.
```

```
fascinating. considering the size of some of the prey it swallows, won‚Äôt a good number of them be able to eat their way out?
```

```
So Icarus and Daedalus just needed to eat too much and they could have avoided the whole melting wax wings fiasco.
```

```
I hate it when that happens!
```

```
A compelling case against gluttony.
```

```
I used to behave like this fish in all-you-can-eat-buffet. Last time I did something like that I did float up to stratosphere. A big burp & few farts later, I survived.

No more rising to stratosphere for me.
```

```
‚Äú if you overeat, the lunch rotting in your stomach will produce buoyant gases and you‚Äôll float up to the stratosphere and die.‚Äù Someone tell that to the current occupant of the White House.
```

```
File that right next to the jackalope.
```

```
Man the ocean has so many marvels that people are unaware about. It has always fascinated me. Hence, going into zoology. It‚Äôs a shame we know more about the moon than we do about the critters that live in deep ocean. We can‚Äôt even get many to the surface without the pressure differential making them‚Ä¶
```

```
Mmmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôm hungry. I‚Äôll be back in a few hours.
```

```
Words to live by‚Ä¶
```

```
Fascinating and unbelievable!
```

```
I agree with the overeating and producing gasses, but I‚Äôve yet to start floating.
```

```
Wow! So much left to learn.
```

```
Definitely a moral to live by
```

```
Thanks Gary - loved your article. And the pictures!
```

```
Moral of the story, wtf hahahah
```

```
Hahaha.. I liked the moral of the story.. ü§£
```

```
Another alternative is that you release the gases with an enormous burp or umh ahh in another way, to incredible applause, followed immediately by a request to open the damned windows!
```

```
I'm reminded of a Bible verse.

Psalm 145:9-10 The LORD is good to all, And His mercies are over all His works.

Funny old chap, that God.
```

```
A black swallower? I think I‚Äôve dated her.
```

```
Hence the expression: Never bite off more than you can chew, literally!
```

```
*garbled profanity and existential anguish*
```

```
What does this say about the adaptability and and wisdom of evolutionary survival?
```

```
OMG! I so desperately wish I could do that!
```

```
I wonder how many people read this and thought you was describing one of their ex-girlfriends?
```

```
Burping.

If it can save just one life.
```

```
‚ÄúBite more than you can chew‚Äù
```

```
The ocean is the scariest place on earth!
```

```
Gluttony is a sure path to the heavens.
```

```
It is strange this reminds me of foghorn leghorn and the lil chicken hawk?

This is the attitude of the chicken hawk, after all.

‚ÄúLemme at im. LEMME at immmm.‚Äù
```

```
The other moral of the story is that if you over eat better make sure you fart before you die.
```

```
I had not idea. Thanks!
```

```
Yes and send a lot of methane into the atmosphere. Very interesting though. I love nature, I believe all of the species are created for a different purpose. I myself think hyena are disproportionate.
```

```
Fish do not burp?
```

```
How do u think it kills those animals bigger than itself, like that mackerel? Or it scavenges?
```
