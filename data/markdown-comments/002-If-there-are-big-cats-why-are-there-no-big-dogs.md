## Why Felines Have Bigger Canines Than Canines
    
**Upvotes**: 8,598 | **Comments**: 339 | **Date**: [Updated Jan 8](https://www.quora.com/If-there-are-big-cats-why-are-there-no-big-dogs/answer/Gary-Meaney)

Most of today’s large, land-dwelling carnivores can be divided into two categories: the cursorial (running) pack hunters and the solitary ambush predators. It would seem that, for mammals at least, these are the two most efficient survival strategies, because several groups have independently evolved to fall squarely into each category.

All canines which are macropredatory (they eat very big animals, that is) subscribe to the former lifestyle. To be specific, that means the grey wolf:

The dhole:

The African wild dog:

The wonderful yet underappreciated bush dog:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1547aed96913b40cf5561054f43ebb7b-lq)

And the dingo (as well as it’s little-known relative, the New Guinea singing dog):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-acb9f0f2f596fce15404eddf8c3cf8ee-lq)

They’re not the only members of the category, however. Despite being more closely related to felines, hyenas very much exemplify this hunting strategy - the spotted hyena in particular.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-162c25da9f0ee1284dbd1ebb886fcf9b-lq)

All of the animals above work together in packs in order to bring down prey much larger than themselves. Because each individual is small (in comparison to the quarry), overpowering prey through brute strength is unfeasible. Instead, they must use superior endurance to run victims into the ground.

This is reflected in their anatomy. The legs are very slim, and the claws are big and blunt in order to provide traction during a long-distance pursuit. The wrists are stiff and immobile, preventing any joint stress that might come with the repetitive impacts of running. The forelegs also tend to be a little longer than the hindlegs.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bf52f9daa0222a6b70ac163972944fc1-pjlq)

Long, unbroken pursuits are most viable in open environments, and as such these carnivores typically inhabit savannahs and grasslands. The air carries scents well in these landscapes, so they always have acute senses of smell - hence the elongated, or telocephalic, snout.

Another factor at play is the fact that, once an animal has been chased to the point of total exhaustion, it’s not going anywhere. Thus, pack-hunting carnivores are in no rush to actually kill their prey - they can just start eating and let it die slowly.

To capitalize on this macabre advantage, their carnassial teeth (at the back of the mouth, equivalent to our molars) are usually huge, adapted for crushing through meat, sinew and even bone. In spotted hyenas, the carnassials are almost comically out of proportion!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-85ccdcba79e3f496c867316146f4ed88-lq)

Now, let’s discuss the second hunting strategy: solitary ambush predation. While the textbook examples of the former category are canines, the most obvious exemplars of this one are felines. Big cats, to be more specific.

That includes the tiger:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b6e09585994ace744c3d11ad9efcaad-lq)

The leopard:

The jaguar:

The snow leopard:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b22023738282615f166747d65f489941-lq)

The two species of clouded leopard:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7cd7d283f1151b5a1f456953a7dbe763-lq)

And the puma:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c8dbfe620f7f1084233aaa6702c34b53-lq)

Lions are an interesting case, since they live the lifestyle of a pack-hunting predator, but only evolved this behaviour very recently. Anatomically, they still have most of the hallmarks of ambush predators.

Cheetahs are somewhere in between the two - they have many characteristics typical of pack-hunters (males even hunt in cooperative groups called coalitions), but also a few of their feline relatives, and they tend to use agility as their weapon of choice, rather than stamina.

Anyway, there are a handful of other members of the ambush predator classification, such as the polar bear.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-319eed3289b6d4b7515e9f9ff1a95ba9-lq)

As said, all of these animals lead solitary lives. This has resulted in most of them being much larger than animals which hunt in packs - in order to tackle very large targets, they have to carry muscle mass equivalent to that of several small predators.

Rather than running down their prey, they sneak up on it, getting in as close as possible unnoticed before pouncing. Most, but not all, live in forested ecosystems, where the dense vegetation can conceal their approach.

Since they don’t have the luxury of finding their victims in a state of exhaustion, ambush predators must be extremely efficient killers. The legs are thickly muscled, with the back pair being longer than the front pair, in order to produce a powerful lunge. The wrists are very flexible, able to grasp the prey, and the razor-sharp claws are retractible, ensuring that the ground does not dull them.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-865563878c6dfedcc7fbfea8e6f356ea-lq)

The dentition is also very different to what you would see in a cursorial pack-hunting predator. Rather than the carnassials, it is the fangs that are absurdly enlarged, as they are used to deliver that lightning-fast fatal bite. Yes, ironically, felines have bigger canines than canines.

This trait is most pronounced in the clouded leopards. Relative to their size, they have the largest canines of any cat, being almost comparable to the saber-tooths of old.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-23c0663e46c3d1faaf43a91136a0b43e-lq)

The snout is also brachycephalic (shortened, in other words), a feature which maximizes bite force. This tends to compromise the sense of smell, so the sense of hearing is often much more developed. Good hearing also lends itself well to the forest landscape.

* * *

So, that was my incredibly long-winded and digressive way of answering your very simple question. Hopefully some of you found my rambles interesting. If you didn’t want to read all that, here’s a straight answer: canines hunt in packs, so they don’t have to individually match the physical strength of the solitary felines. Thank you for reading, have a great day.

Why are your answers always so fun to read? The amount of expertise you would have needed to write such awesome answers for laymen is just amazing. I haven’t asked this before, but who is your favorite living being, if you have any? And do you enjoy watching nature documentaries like some rocket sci…

Very interesting answer. The answer was detailed not long winded. I wonder if lions are different because they banded together for protection particularly from hyenas and not as a hunting strategy. I read an article once that talked about lion verses hyena encounters and they determined that victory…

Great answer! I dont mind your high quality long windedness at all, the nerd in me craves it!

Upvoted and followed.

Very interesting and informative as usual, Gary!

“…long winded and digressive” indeed! This is one of your SHORTER answers, if I am not mistaken! Heh!

No matter! We love everything that you feel like writing! Short, long, War and Peace…it’s all good! Just keep those amazing photos coming!

Seems like male African lions act as ambush hunters but also hunt with the females as a pack.

Intelligent answer. Thank you.

I wish more answers on Quora were from people who actually knew what the hell they were talking about.. Lol

Sometimes it's just like “I drink and know things.”

Again... Thanks.
```

```
Terrific answer and I can't help but think that the use of “coalition” for a pack of cheetahs has some poltical use. The anatomical comparison was really interesting —I've had both cats and dogs and noticed these (admittedly small scale) behaviors in them but never put it all together.
```

```
It may have e been long-winded but I loved the details and explanations. Please keep up the long-winded great work.

Not often do I stumble across words that aren't already in my vocabulary and you used a couple… better than that you defined them for me. Woot!

Excellent answer- indeed it is an illustrated essay. Quora at its best. Now following.

Very interesting answer. Even very large canines like Dire Wolves fit the pattern (they were hunting megafauna, after all), although is is very amusing to see my house cat carefully stalking me…..

There is one branch of the canine family, the foxes, that are solitary hunters. They are also comparatively small, feeding largely on small game. One could wonder why none evolved into larger size to take advantage of larger prey. Perhaps that would have put them in disadvantaged competition with pa…

Thank you! Well laid out, concise and clear, and mostly new to me and thus fascinating.

A great answer to a great question. Par for the course. The expectations are stratospheric, and you reach them every time.

Thank God for long winded people like you. It was an engrossing read. THank you.
```

```
Awesome answer. Highly readable and informative. Only one inaccuracy. It's detailed, NOT long winded!

Anything you write is super interesting. I always wondered why the canines of some cats were larger than that of dogs. If one wants to read about animals and nature this guy gives a superb glance that feels like cheating. Like larger books or grad students would be discussing…

I’m now contemplating how my dog and cats walk, run and stalk… Thanks for a great answer.

Wonderful stuff Gary, as always. You are a credit to the Quora platform.
```

Loved your answer. Very informative. And I always like to see a bit of irony in an answer.
```

```
Thank you, Gary, for another very informative answer and for the great images too.
```

Gary once again I found myself reading an answer without noting the author. By about the fourth sentence I could pleasantly tell you were the author! As always, a very interesting read, with a wealth of information pertinent to the question! Cheers.

This was SUCH A GOOD ANSWER. I had never really thought of these factors before, and your pictures to illustrate were great. Thank you!
```

Thank you for putting it into words! All of my life I've known that feline fangs were proportionally larger than a canines' canines! How the Hell did I miss that?!? . Kudos on the summation provided for the, equally incomprehensible to me, too, short-attentioned who spooled down to the bottom of your a…

No Gary, please be as long winded as you like. Feel free to let loose because you're now my only source of animal knowledge since I've basically exhausted documentaries 😂😂

Extremely interesting, Gary, beautiful pictures and very good comparative info also. No rambling, you were thorough but quick to the point! I study animals quite a bit and I learned a thing or two from your information! Thank you for sharing. I also read that the felines’ long fangs enable them to (…
```

```
What a great answer. Nicely done and thanks!
```

```
FABULOUS detailed and technical answer.

You have made the differences very clear and logical to me.
```

```
Thank you. I really enjoyed reading this answer and learning more about canines and felines. One of the best examples of why I read Quora, despite my perception that the quality of both questions and answers has declined.
```

```
This was a fascinating article. Thanks for taking the time and effort to post it.
```

```
Fascinating.

Why did lions evolve into pack hunters recently, and how recently is that?
```

```
Very good as usual, Gary. No shortcuts for you, man!
```

```
Excellent read! You could also add the Cougar/Mountain Lion and Bobcat/Wildcat to the list of ambush predators.
```

```
Thanks, fascinating. Clouded leopards are one of the most beautiful creatures, but you wouldn’t want to mess with those teeth
```

```
‘Felines have longer canines than canines’: worth reading for that line alone.
```

```
Awesome response. I learned several new terms, and your explanation of solitary ambush v pack chase predators would make any student want to learn more. I’m now checking into more details about these hunters. Thank you!
```

```
That was a great answer. I very much enjoyed reading it. It was the kind of information that seemed obvious (once I had it).

THIS! This is what Quora is meant to be like and once was like, a real question, and a really good answer, bravo, well done. 👍

Amid all the politics and American-centric nastiness prevalent on the site now, I’d almost forgotten that Quora can be a wonderful resource for just learning new things! Thanks for rekindling a jaded old man’s interest in all those things I never knew I needed to know…

```
I’d be curious to hear about what happens when prey decide, “Forget that, I’m not gonna outlast an endurance predator, so let’s do this right here while I’m rested, scum!” Why doesn’t this happen all the time? Are the prey herds too disorganized, or do chases frequently fail? Among a herd, the old j…

I love science! Good basic overview of carnivorous mammals.

Some may be interested to know that jaguars in recent years have been spotted in southern Arizona and New Mexico. They are returning northward. When the Spanish arrived, there were jaguars in California.

Thank you for an excellent and informative answer.

I think I learned more from this answer than from an entire semester of evolutionary biology. Much appreciated, and here is your upvote.

Gary,

I am eternally grateful to your parents for making sure that you stayed awake during biology class. Seriously, this is a very well written article. The photos and information are top shelf all the way. I do thank you.

I wish all answers on Quora were this informative and interesting! Cheers!

Thinking of fangs, the sabre tooth cats come to mind. I believe they used those fangs to stab the prey. They would have been amazing animals to see.

Hi Gary, I find your answers very interesting. I have a question about animals and their sounds. Can I ask it here or should I try asking it on Quora in a more general way?

There *were* very large canine predators in the past, such as the Dire Wolf and Steppe Wolf. I forget just how large though.

Very interesting and clear. I would like to follow you but don’t know how. Thank you.

Thank you for the comprehensive and interesting answer. I wouldn’t call it long-winded.

which begs the following question, why have none of the canines evolved to be solitary predators?

There are also foxes, which are canine but hunt alone while sneaking, like most big felines.

If you have ever come face to face with a wolf in the wild, which I have three times, you would have your answer. If they have an abundant food source they can get very big and surprisingly tall. If your an average height man(5’9) the odd one could almost look you in the eye.

I always thought canines and hyenas had longer snouts so they could nip at their prey’s hindquarters more easily, causing them to bleed and exhaust much faster. Also, don’t hyenas and canines have much stronger bites than most cats?

I don’t know why one wouldn’t consider a canine that could reach up to 6.5 feet (2 meters) long and 175 pounds (80kg) a big dog.

There are big dogs….

I'm sure scientists won't agree with me, but I say all bears are dogs. Polar bear, grizzly, brown bear, black bears are dogs.

So, yes; there are big dogs.

Did you really just give an answer that said that there are two categories of predators… One category that hunts alone in another category that hunts with others. G how insightful.

Regarding snout length and sense of smell. I thought that all the olfactory sensors are all located in the tip of the nose (the leathery bit) which meant that a shih-tzu would have a sense of smell equal to a labrador for example. Am I wrong?

```
In summary: There are no big wolves. There are certainly big dogs. Oh, the humanity.
```

```
An excellent answer, Sir. However, let me put the same question in a slightly different manner. Was there ever a really “big bad wolf” in the past, which may have hunted alone but did not survive the evolutionary pressure. Did we ever find large wolf like fossil? Thanks in advance.
```

```
Bears are more closely related to dogs than to cats. They belong to a canid-like family.
```

```
Wonderful answer! Thoughtful and well edited. Thanks.
```

and aren’t bears somewhat related to canines (but not canines themselves)?
```

```
Loved the answer and pictures. But I think the OP meant to ask why didn’t dogs evolve to be big dogs like the solitary feline hunters you had mentioned.
```

```
Hyenas are more closely related to cats than canines.
```

```
It seems as though you answered (very well) the “how” rather than the “why”, which is what the questioner was asking. Canines developed pack behavior BECAUSE they are smaller, just as the big cats CAN be isolated hunters BECAUSE they are larger, but that doesn’t answer WHY each diverged this way siz…
```

```
Excellent post! Thank you!

Very well articulated answer. But if feel the original question is still unanswered - which now is changed to why there are no canine species that are solitary hunters
