Here‚Äôs one which not a lot of people know about: some birds feed pond fish as if they were their own young.

In 2010, someone filmed a northern cardinal feeding pet goldfish in their garden pond. Allegedly, the bird does this up to six times each day. What on Earth could be going on?

It‚Äôs not the first time someone has observed this. One photo, probably taken in the early sixties depicts an incredibly similar incident, and has featured in numerous textbooks from the ‚Äô60s and ‚Äò70s.

Other cases I managed to find include this short video of a duckling feeding koi:

Another one of a Brazilian teal with some kind of fish:

And several clips/photos of black swans seemingly feeding koi from China and Taiwan.

So, are these birds just Good Samaritans looking out for their freshwater friends? Seemingly random acts of kindness aren‚Äôt unknown in the animal world - some of you may know of [the lioness who ‚Äúadopted‚Äù a baby oryx.](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-bizarre-animal-behaviors-that-not-many-people-know-about/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com")

However, this is likely not the explanation here. Rather, there are two separate explanations. In the last four instances I mentioned, the birds ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù the koi were waterfowl, specifically in the family Anatidae. More or less all birds in this family often dip their food in the water, perhaps to make it easier to swallow.

Essentially, the birds are just getting robbed by the fish. Not as heartwarming an explanation as one would hope for, but it doesn‚Äôt explain the cardinals‚Ä¶

The best answer to the question of the first two birds is one which has been pointed out by a few people. To a bird, this:

might look a lot like this:

It would appear that the cardinals interpret the gaping, bright red mouths of the goldfish as those of young cardinal chicks. The parental instinct kicks in, and they start feeding the fish.

This is a great example of how adaptations can have ‚Äúunintended‚Äù side effects - in feeding the goldfish, the cardinals are wasting food they could otherwise eat themselves (or, you know, give to their actual kids), so you‚Äôd think they and their young would be at a selective disadvantage. However, since populations of cardinals are overall better off with the parental instinct than without, the net result is that the behaviour continues.

And not necessarily any more blindly instinctive or stupid than the human urge to feed anything that looks ‚Äúcute‚Äù, since our idea of cute usually means ‚Äúa bit like a human baby‚Äù.

One thing leads to another, and this is how Flying Mermaids are born. Just saying.
```

```
Yes, the last explanation is the best, if I remember correctly both Lorenz and Tinbergen also went with it.
```

I wonder if this will develop into another evolutionary ‚Äúarms race‚Äù, with evolution favoring fish who appear to be hungry chicks, and also favoring cardinals with an increased ability to differentiate their hungry chicks from random chick-like fish mouths.
```

I can see the goldfish/cardinal mouth similarity, but the koi to the Swan? Imagine it from the fishes pov! Cool to see cheers, such amazing friendship between two species. It's a shame one species (human) can't get along so well with itself all the time. üçªüçÄ‚úåÔ∏èüíûüôè

Great photos and explanations

Have also seen birds fishing. They throw food into the water as bait and catch and eat fish that come up and take the bait

Ah, that explains it.

I recall seeing this many years ago. It was noticed that when white koi came up to get in on the action, the birds completely ignored them. This strengthened the observer‚Äôs assumption that the fish mouths were triggering the parental instinct of the birds. Without the coloring, the birds didn‚Äôt conf‚Ä¶

outdoor goldfish take food from thj surface by gaping their mouths thus drawing in whatever from the surface.. some goldfish will go for things at the water edge.. birds feed their young according to which ones gape widest, this is a strong instinct in birds.. perhaps the gaping triggered a feed res‚Ä¶

One should always look at Evolution with systemic analysis. It is wrong to say that parental instincts hoodwinked + non-hookwinked, as long as the non-hookwinked parental instincts encourages growth for the cardinals. Evolution triumphs without thought or purpose or reasoning. Evolution need not be the‚Ä¶

When I was a kid, I used to feed bread to the ducks at the lake near our house. When ducks were on the water and I‚Äôd throw bread to them, they wouldn‚Äôt eat it. Instead, they‚Äôd go fishing with it. They would hover over it, and when a fish came up to eat some bread, the duck would grab the fish and sw‚Ä¶

This demonstrates nicely the trade-off between intelligence and what some would vaguely refer to as ‚Äúinstinct‚Äù. If the animal is only capable of basic association such as ‚Äúbright red beak ==> dispense food‚Äù but can‚Äôt understand the context that makes or breaks the functionality of this, then it will‚Ä¶

Or the birds may have excess food (note the multiple food buckets), and see the fish are hungry. It is a fallacy that nature is selfish, even primitive animals can benefit from altruism. It keeps the ecosystem healthier (e.g. fed fish produce fish poo that plants that birds eat grow from), it impres‚Ä¶

There‚Äôs a ton of stuff on YouTube about birds feeding fish. Bird stands on bank or in shallow water and then drops food, bread, potato chips, French fry, in the water. When fish moves in to eat the bird grabs him and swallows him. Search for ‚ÄúBird lures fish,‚Äù ‚ÄúHeron baits catfish.‚Äù When younger I w‚Ä¶

If I can feed pond fish, then birds can feed pond fish. Not judging.

Some birds fish fish though. It‚Äôs really cool:
```

I like how birds and fish say hello to each other sometimes. Food given by a bird to a fish I imagine is like restaurant take out food to a fish. Why only eat from what's in the sea only? Why not sometimes get some land food by a bird friend? Makes sense to me.
```

```
Humans always have to rationalize things to the nth degree when scenarios don't fall into their trained way of thinking. The fish are in water. Do we really think a bird can't differentiate between a nest and water? Come on guys and gals.

Animals are more intelligent than what is perceived.

Several times I have observed my large 10 month old puppy take a mouthful of its food and drop it directly in front of one of our two cats. The dog then watches the cat eat it while wagging her tail.

This happened just once. Me and my friend Larry played a game of Frisbee golf. On the first tee a red cardinal was sitting on the round sign that had a one on it. They all had signs except for 1 basket. When we threw our Frisbee's he took off and when we got to hole two he was sitting sign number 2.‚Ä¶
