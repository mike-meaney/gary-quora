For me, I have a few, but one of them would be the earless monitor lizard. It’s not quite a monitor lizard as its name suggests, but is the only species in its own separate family, Lanthanotidae. It looks a bit like a lizard trying to be a dinosaur from an old 19th-century reconstruction.

Another misnomer in their name is “earless” - they can hear, though they lack an eardrum and don’t even have ear openings, hence the genus name Lanthanotus (meaning “hidden ear”). Their eyes are also greatly reduced, and at a glance are hard to spot at all. This is unusual as their relatives the monitors have excellent vision.

Found only in Borneo, the earless monitor lizard is a semi-aquatic creature found in tropical rainforests, and is rarely seen far from water. It also has a prehensile tail which can wrap around branches, allowing it to climb adeptly. Studies have shown that, like some of their close relatives, lanthanotids have a venomous bite.

Interestingly enough, earless monitors have been known to shed their skin in one piece, rather than in flakes, which is something only seen in snakes, not other lizards. Additionally, they have snake-like forked tongues, frog-like throat pouches, and they make squeaking noises.

Unfortunately, this species is poached as it is popular with exotic animal collectors. However, it’s so poorly understood that we do not yet know what its conservation status is. It could be endangered for all we know.

That’s the closest thing I’ve seen to a dragon. Well, the dragons I used to read about it fairytales. Gorgeous!
```

God, I want one and I wish it was ethical to have one. Alas! I’ll have to admire from afar. Gorgeous animals.

Wow, I have never heard or seen this creature before. TIL. Your wealth of knowledge about obscure animals is why I followed you.

Gary you will always show me animals I had no idea they existed! Keep it up. I bet this lizard has some hidden relation with snakes.
```

European Legless Lizards shed their skin whole like a snake! So the Earless Monitor lizard has a whole shed skin friend.

Its head looks like Godzilla’s.

Don’t they have a rudimentary “third eye” as well?
```

```
The origin of dragon lore, to be sure!
```

```
My answer under this question is … anacondas…When they are swallowing a big meal,,, their windpipe gets pushed out of their mouth?throat? … to function as a SNORKEL….
```

```
Well it's Southeast Asian, so chances are there's a market for it in poaching somewhere.
