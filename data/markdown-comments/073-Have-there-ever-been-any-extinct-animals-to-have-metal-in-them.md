Yes, absolutely. Your skeleton is made of calcium phosphate, one of the components of which is of course calcium - a metal. Your blood is full of hemoglobin, made largely of iron. Magnesium and zinc help your muscles contract and the manufacture of your DNA.

If you mean the more stereotypical image of metal as a shiny, uh, metallic plating, then the answer is still yes. This is the scaly-foot gastropod, who has a shell plated in iron sulfide. It has a visible metallic shine.

The foul, repulsive bloodworm, a type of polychaete worm, has hooked teeth which are made out of copper.

For these animals to exist, they must have had prehistoric ancestors. Unless these metallic organs are extremely recent innovations, there would have been extinct animals which shared their traits.

Iron sulfide is actually not a metal. It is a material that looks like metal, but in reality is a ceramic/mineral, since it has ionic bonds. As far as I know the teeth of the bloodworm are actually not metallic, but composite, since it consists of traditional teeth with some added copper atoms. Not a…

That bloodworm will haunt my nightmares.

Very cool. I love gastropods they are so weird.

I ’ve used bloodworms for fish bait. You have to be real careful when putting them on the hook. Their bite is very painful !

Worm Uses Copper to Harden Jaws, Fangs, Report Says Metal/protein composite, not with calcium like our teeth. Really interesting. And metal isn’t just worked metal. It’s metal ions, or metal compounds like chelates that are bioactive. If you speak chemistry6. If you are speaking colloquially about what…

And some people still find it hard to believe that we have non-living origins.

Plenty of sea life with mercury in them now, quite a few people probably too.

Is that bloodworm the one which comes out of the chasm and attacks the crew in the movie King Kong?

I took it that the OP was asking if there were any animals with actual metal in them. Pure metal, not metallic compounds.
