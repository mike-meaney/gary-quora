I’m gonna have to go with hummingbirds. You may well have seen some firsthand, and while they are generally considered novel creatures, I don’t think many are aware of just how bizarre they really are.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-da4bee84502c669d0dff08f0a880206b-lq)

First and foremost, there’s their metabolism. Hummingbirds have the fastest metabolic rate of any animal on Earth, except for some insects. Their hearts beat at a positively mind-blowing rate of 1,260 BPM during flight, and even at rest they have to take 250 breaths per minute. For comparison, the average person’s max heart rate and resting breathing rate are 180 and 12–20, respectively.

Having a breakneck metabolism brings with it many, many challenges. To prevent themselves from overheating, many hummingbird have featherless patches under their shoulders, on their wings, and around their eyes, where excess heat can dissipate efficiently.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d6a3db2cf378ef9b6dd7a23ed2644a3f-lq)

That said, if a human were to have the same metabolic rate, despite being wholly hairless, they would surely perish. This is, of course, because we are much, much, much bigger than hummingbirds. In fact, hummingbirds are the world’s smallest birds by far.

In Cuba, you can find the aptly named bee hummingbird, whose size cannot be understated. The males can measure as little as 5 centimetres in length, and weigh a paltry 2 grams. Despite their tininess, bee hummingbirds are quite beautiful.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-353698b587a4624785c14673f8a0f169-lq)

You would think these minuscule birds wouldn’t eat much food, but - bearing in mind their metabolism - that is far from the case. Every day, a typical hummingbird will suck nectar from roughly 2,000 flowers, in addition to eating plenty of small insects, consuming triple their bodyweight in food total. They have to eat once every 10–15 minutes.

They also take in a huge amount of water, up to five times their bodyweight daily. That would be equivalent to me downing more than 1,600 glasses in a single day, i.e. a few glasses in every minute I’m awake. Because of this massive influx of hydration, their kidneys have evolved to precisely filter the levels of water and electrolytes in the body.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-921991d6daf50315f641603f78c1a905-lq)

You might also be wondering how hummingbirds cope with lean times, given that they need so much food just to survive. If there is a shortage of nutrition, they take extreme measures - that is, they enter a hibernation-like state of torpor in order to save energy. The heartbeat slows down to 1/25th of its normal pace, and their body temperature more than halves.

Rather adorably, hummingbirds hang upside down while they are torpid!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0fbb9193705c75dfc5f95c9dab3ba969-lq)

The hummingbird metabolism means that the mitochondria in their cells must produce energy as quickly and efficiently as possible. So, instead of performing glycolysis - breaking glucose down into pyruvic acid and using the resulting free energy to form molecules like ATP - like normal organisms, they have the amazing ability to instantly convert glucose into energy, by simply oxidizing it.

What’s even more interesting is that they can do the same thing to another sugar, fructose. As well as being high in glucose, flower nectar contains plenty of fructose, so by being able to immediately metabolize it they get a lot more fuel out of their food.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9a41e8081bb7a1de4da504251533ee6b-lq)

Speaking of nectar, hummingbirds ingest this sweet liquid using one of the most fascinating tongues in the animal world. This tongue is so long that it coils around the skull when retracted, and has two twin tubes. When the tongue is ejected, the tubes split apart, and a row of flaps unfurls on each side.

Droplets catch on these flaps, which snap shut as the tongue is drawn back into the mouth, trapping the nectar. This repeats in incredibly rapid succession, as the hummingbird flicks their tongue in and out of the flower with a pumping action.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d8c7b70bb6a1468eea154673f2e51801-pjlq)

Another cool adaptation one species has for nectarivory is an absurdly long beak. The sword-billed hummingbird of the Andes has the proportionally longest bill of any bird in the world; at more than 15 cm, it even exceeds the body length.

This allows the species to access flowers which have very deep corollas (petal tubes), which are out of reach to all of their would-be competitors.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cb3b543d3ba70185a28e1edcbc457b39-lq)

While we’re on the topic of odd and novel species of hummingbird, I should also mention a couple of types which have beautiful plumage. Specifically, the long-tailed sylph:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3c3a95d04504065ba1874675dc60ec94-lq)

And the white-booted racket tail:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2bbc73cf248c12447a53c4db25b79f38-lq)

The former has extraordinarily long tail feathers, and the latter has a very interesting sexual display feature. Male racket-tails get their name from the two little oval-shaped flags which trail behind them, used for attracting females. Both sexes also have lovely fluffy pom poms on their legs - hence “white-booted”.

Lastly, hummingbird behaviour is almost as fascinating as their diet and metabolism. Take flight, for example Hummingbirds are perhaps the most skilled aviators in nature (insects aside); their aerial acrobatics are simply jaw-dropping. They can fly in any direction, including backwards and sideways, and can hover on the spot.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f520773924aeadc722121f4220342e95-lq)

To perform these feats, they beat their wings at an unimaginably fast pace of 80 times per second!

Focusing one’s eyes with so much rapid aerial movement is also highly challenging; in order to refine their vision, the optic tract of the hummingbird brain is greatly enlarged. In addition to that, they are tetrachromatic; they have four types of colour receptor cells, in comparison to our three. This enables them to perceive five extra colours which are “invisible” to us humans.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-661f2d0c0205b8e82b7e5c08d5b9208d-lq)

Not only do they have enhanced vision - they appear to have enhanced intelligence, too. Relative to their body size, hummingbirds have the biggest brain of any bird - they account for nearly 5% of the mass, whereas our brains are around 2% of our total body weight.

Of course, we have to keep in mind that this is partially because they’re so small - brain size does not scale directly proportionally to body weight. However, hummingbirds show behavioural signs of intelligence as well: they are one of only three bird groups which have vocal learning abilities, i.e. listening to, imitating and reproducing the sound of others.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e1c896ddfe769379e0064a8f04c89e0e-pjlq)

So, with all that in mind, I’d go so far as to argue that hummingbirds aren’t just stranger than people realize, they’re the strangest birds that have ever lived. Thank you very, very much for sticking around through this long answer, I hope you found it interesting, and have a great day.

I’ve observed hummingbirds hanging upside-down, appearing dead. I got very close. Thank you for the explanation for that, I’ve always wondered.

They are fascinating creatures to watch. I have witnessed many aerial acrobatics and mini dog fights! One of my favorite maneuvers is when they twirl around each other while ascending or descending. I was lucky to get these two shots as they don’t often share a feeder. I believe that these must be f…

I know this feature is not exclusive to hummingbirds, but it is yet another unusual characteristic, and that is the bright colours of their feathers are the result of refraction, as they are black.

Are Hummingbirds very territorial? They seem to fight with one another quite a bit and they are very vocal when they fight. The birds in my yard yell at each other and chase one another around.

Given that their tongues wrap around the skull, perhaps in the way that woodpeckers' tongues do, are hummingbirds related to woodpeckers?

Hi Gary

I always enjoy your thoughtful answers.

For some reason a hummingbird recently was observing me while hovering head on, eye level at a distance of about 10 feet for about 5 to 10 seconds and more recently a dove perched watching me that positioned itself on the other side of grape leaves.

What I find really amazing that some hummingbirds, I think it is some of the Ruby-throated hummingbirds, migrate nonstop across the Gulf of Mexico. That’s 500 miles of nonstop flying. I just keep thinking what an enormous distance that is for such a little bird.
```

```
I learned something new about hummingbirds this year. I always thought of them as warm-weather birds who would migrate to more pleasant climates in the winter. However I found that some species, notably Anna’s Hummingbird, will stay where they are as long as there is a food source. I had one take up…

I’ve long believed — and there’s no way to prove this — that if hummingbirds didn’t exist, and I were to propose the idea “Hey, I wonder if there could be a bird that hovers like a helicopter while feeding on flowers” a bunch of biologists would laugh at the idea. They, the biologists in this non-hu…

Agreed, a marvelous lesson. One hummer sort of got trapped inside my house in the mountains. I tried opening doors, but the bird remained inside. S/he stayed overnight. I was concerned about lack of food because I knew their metabolic rate was so high. Next morning, s/he was still alive, perching on…

Hummingbirds do seem to possess some intelligence.

Never had I seen a hummingbird in real life until I moved here. I was sitting on the porch and something flew at me like to attack me. I thought it was some kind of giant bug.

Very interesting answer. Just one nit — it doesn’t make sense to say that their body temperature drops by more than half, since our commonly used temperature scales put zero in an arbitrary place.

Thanks Garry! Amazing answer once again. Is it true that Sword Billed Hummingbirds are the only bird species that cannot preen themselves?
```

```
Wow Gary, thank you very much for your answer, there is a couple of those wonderful birds that came out to our garden every day. I will admire them more after reading your answer.
```

```
Oh, my! Fantastic answer. Thank you
```

```
Thank you! Ik never learned so much in such a short time.

But my question: do the hummingbirds play a role in pollination or give the flowers their nectar away for free??
```

```
This is a prime reason why I allowed my yard to become overrun with trumpet vines. These little guys gotta eat, too. It’s no surprise that they hang upside-down when torporus; it facilitates blood reaching their brains. What incredible little creatures they are.

I upvote lots of answers, but I don’t bookmark many. This answer got both. Fascinating!

See the little guys in action here.

Warning: hilarious!

More than interesting, utterly fascinating. I knew hummingbirds were different from other birds but had no idea how much. Thanks!
```

```
Truly mind blowing. Thanks for the fantastic post. I always want to know more about hummingbirds.
```

```
Fascinating! Thank you! And there’s even more: It’s my understanding that some species at least partially construct their nests from spider silk and their eggs - are the size of a dime! (I’m sure the Bumblebee hummer eggs are even smaller!)

Thanks for another exceptional, fascinating read. You are like the Sir Richard Attenborough of Quora.

I find that the hummingbird wing is an absolutely fascinating construction and marvelously efficient. It seems to be, if I remember aright, nearly all ‘hand’ section, nearly all of it primary feathers, the part of the wing that provides thrust, and very little ‘forearm’ section with the secondaries,…

The thing about hummingbirds that most surprised me is that it is extremely difficult to feed them in captivity … even for professionals at a facility like a zoo or a sanctuary for birds recovering from injuries. It is illegal in all 50 states to keep them as pets, though only California (as far as…

I started feeding Hummingbirds about 7 years ago. I usually had about 3 birds on a consistent basis. Last year, a storm passed thru and we then had about 10. This year we had around 7 -10 all year. The last bird left on September 20th this year.

They are very smart, I love ‘em.

Very good. Nice.

Each line as I read, has been a new discovery.

Pics are very beautiful.

I was a little disappointed that the content on this amazing bird ended soon.

All credits goes to the bird 🐦 for being a part of our life and nature, the creator, and you for bringing this to our notice and knowledge.
```

```
That was excellent. Thank you for the fascinating and detailed response.

Humming birds are one of my favorite bird species. I love watching them and have been putting out feeders for them for at least 40 years so that I always have some in my backyard.🌺

I wonder how many generations of those beautiful, fascinating birds I have fed over those many years.

Your articles are always fascinating to read. I have two feeders at my home up in Ottawa Canada and they always amaze me.

Something else people do not understand about these birds, or at least I did not. Was how far the little ones can poop! I had a nest under the porch one year. There was a 6 foot radius around that nest that was unsafe to travel. The young birds not only squirted poo 6 feet, but did it often.

Because of their food intake requirements, hummingbirds are also extremely aggressive, violently defending their foraging territory from other hummingbirds, and even from birds like hawks that don’t eat nectar, I guess because you can’t be too careful.

Fascinating information about hummingbirds!

Hummingbirds also eat insects on the fly as a signicant dietary component and do not survive solely on nectar. Also while hovering, the hummingbird can maintain a constant position with their head, keeping it motionless while pivoting their body around it.
