I can’t seem to stop answering these types of questions, but they are pretty fun and usually well-received, so let’s give it another go.

Owlflies

Ever heard of a [wobbegong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wobbegong "en.wikipedia.org") shark? Well, imagine that, but on land, plus enormous mandibles wider than the body. That’s a fair description of an owlfly larva. What’s super cool about them is that some species actually cement sand and debris into their exoskeleton to serve as camouflage, kind of like a tank might with foliage and bushes.

The adults resemble dragonflies in many respects, with the most noticeable difference being their huge, club-tipped antennae, used for balance in flight. Some owlflies actually mimic wasps in their adult morph, like many other insects.

Fairyflies

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6ef9896f60f40c27ea1d61c74f3ec510-lq)

This is an insect - an insect the size of a protozoa, that is. I’m not kidding - these wasps are the most diminutive insects in the world, with the smallest weighing in at 0.0000025 grams, and being about 0.1 millimetres long.

At such a small size, flying is nothing like we could ever imagine. The viscosity of the air makes it soupy, so the smaller fairyflies have to practically swim through the air - hence the bizarre, paddle-shaped wings pictured above.

Pennella

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-808b4fe175fc3f6c49862660bcdfe6cf-pjlq)

Copepods are a type of planktonic crustacean, and they’re usually microscopic. Pennella is a definite exception - in fact, some have been recorded at roughly 1 foot in length! The females cling to the skin of fish and squid as blood-sucking parasites.

The largest species - P. balaenopterae - even infects whales. Several cetaceans have been found covered in the repulsive copepods, which create nasty welts as they burrow deep into their host’s blubber.

Hangingflies

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-23054544d03589ac20bc2350106fef15-lq)

This is what you get when you cross a fly, a spider and a monkey. Using their long, spindly forelimbs, they simply hang from blades of grass all day, using their huge legs to snatch insects which fly past. They’re so specialized for hanging and grabbing that most species can barely walk.

Some hangingflies have an interesting mating ritual where the male presents the female with a captured prey item. If she judges the catch to be of sufficient quality, the male will get to mate with her.

Toad bugs

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eba93f447298256c62eab43c5d3b9d76-lq)

The name is pretty accurate here, given that these insects are warty, squat amphibious animals which have bulging eyes, eat flies, and move by hopping. Found in riverine environments, they are capable swimmers and usually prefer very moist locations.

One especially interesting species of toad bug is Gelastocoris oculatus. It is highly variable in terms of colour - in a single locale, you might find black ones, gray ones, mottled brown ones and even green-and-red ones.

Macrocheles rettenmeyeri

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9ca7b07ec5c2aff57c74d86b6a84a614-lq)

This one is criminally obscure for such an amazing creature. This mite will search for an army ant, and then bite off its foot so it can latch on instead, sucking the ant’s blood (or haemolymph, to be strictly accurate).

What’s really fascinating, though, is that the mite actually serves as a perfectly good foot, and one study suggested that it might even improve the performance of the leg. Besides that, very little is known about these creatures.

Turtle ants

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f668ea858b9fd60e27d333be63295129-pjlq)

This has got to be one of the coolest ants out there, and that’s saying something. Cephalotes soldiers have bizarre heads which are huge and flattened, looking almost like dishes. In the event of the colony being attacked, the soldiers use their massive heads to plug the nest’s entrances (that’s the round thing in the photo).

The strategy is apparently very effective. Commonly known as turtle ants, another cool fact about them is that, using their legs, they can perform a rudimentary form of gliding. Lastly…

Onychocerus albitarsis

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-63ae03890695951aa0b4dac8dc78c753-lq)

Long-horned beetles are famous for their enormous antennae, which are usually longer than the body, and give them their name. Onychocerus albitarsis puts a cherry on top by having venomous stingers on the end of their antennae. As O. albitarsis is a herbivore, they likely have a solely defensive purpose.

It’s actually the only truly venomous beetle among 350,000 other described species, though some leak/spray toxins rather than actually injecting them. Thankfully, the stingers don’t pose a threat to humans, though they may cause “mild swelling”.

Those are 8 really obscure arthropod taxa which deserve a lot more love - hopefully this answer will earn them some more fans. There are of course many other species in this enormous phylum which I could have showcased - not to mention all the bizarre extinct groups - but I’ll leave it at these for now.

Have you ever read Parasite Rex? A fascinating study of these critters: Amazon.com: Parasite Rex: Inside the Bizarre World of Nature's Most Dangerous Creatures (9780743200110): Carl Zimmer: Books I’ve no connection to the author or anything, just loved the book and it seems like something that would a…

Pretty sure the Owlfly has a screen credit as the Ceti eel from Wrath of Khan.
```

```
I thought nothing in real life could possibly be weirder than the bugs that come to me in my nightmares. Thanks for proving me wrong… and giving me more nightmare fuel lol.
```

```
In which countries to the amazing creatures live? Sorry to ask more information of you. Thank you for your contributions, which I'm sure, inspire many, many people to research more]
```

```
Answers like this are not only why I love Quora, but also why I spend so much damned time on it. Thank you.
```

Whaaaa no share more haha! Questions - did you say plankton crustation? Tell me more how it can be both? I thought planktons were tiny guys that whales ate and crustations were like, crabs, prawns, ect.. is it their exoskeleton that classified them? If so then Why aren’t bugs with hard shells referre…

Some of these only get scientific names in your list, are they that obscure they have no known common name? not even a local common name?
```

Gary -

Please keep answering these questions. My wife and I are fans. Your content is among the most interesting and fascinating stuff on the internet.

I wonder if we are on an alien’s list of strange and exotic creatures from far off planets? I wonder how they might describe us?
```

```
That ant mite… that would be like a robot crab slicing your arm off only to transplant itself as a superior bionic arm that takes just a fraction of your blood for energy. Jesus, the insect world is so damn alien it’s like freaking sic-fi!
```

I love that owl fly larva, what does the adult look like?
```

```
>I can’t seem to stop answering these types of questions

Thankfully, I also can’t seem to stop reading your answers to these types of questions!
```

```
What a beautiful answer! Thank you for taking the time to write it.
```

```
Please pardon my biological plebianism, but that Owlfly larvae resembles in my mind a furry, terrestrial trilobyte.
```

```
Thanks for not stopping answering these kinds of questions. Fascinating stuff.
```

```
I never heard at all of some of these! What could a fairy fly possibly eat?
```

```
I give this post a Standing Ovation Upvote as simply brilliant!
```

```
This is a fascinating post, thank you!
```

```
Really informative answer.

Thanks for sharing.
```

```
I knew of some of these, but thee rest is truly fascinating. Some of the mites affecting plants like hibiscus or Lychee Sinensis are fascinating too. But one needs a microscope and a great deal of patience to find them under all that fluff.
```

```
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope again. Nope again too. Nope, nooope annnnd nope.

All these creatures only deserve an interaction with “GUSTAVFF” If you know what I mean.

Thank you sir for giving us such a nop- i mean dope answer!

Ommatokoita - Wikipedia
 is a very interesting copepod, living as it does on a Greenland shark’s eyeball, rendering them blind. This doesn’t seem to much affect the shark, presumably because it relies much more on smell and electroreception.

Hang in there, fly!
```

```
Nature is endlessly fascinating. Even more bizarre than one can imagine.
```

```
Wow & wow, especially for the soupy air bit! Might that have some correlation with evolutionary development of flying in 'higher' ordered species? Perhaps some crazy critter decided that it was.a good idea to latch on to the back of something that could provide it with (xfactor)

```
You have definitely broadened my knowledge of these amazing creatures today! Thank you very much! These are awesome
```

The owfly looks kinda like an ant lion.
```

```
It took me a while to understand the mite leg thing.. I thought the big animal was the mite, and the smaller one was a (type of) ant.
```

```
Absolutely fascinating! Thank you for your research.
```

Thanks so much for posting. Thoroughly fascinating!
