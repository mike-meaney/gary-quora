Right then, time for yet another list answer about “cool species of X”. I wonder what I’ll do on Quora when I run out of species…  
In any case, here are some of my favourite species of bat.

*   Honduran white bat: This enigmatic creature is native to tropical forests in Central America. Snow-white and fluffy, it famously constructs “tents” by folding up the leaves of Heliconia plants. In these tents, colonies of the bats roost at night. Honduran white bats mostly eat fruit; in fact they’re one of the smallest frugivorous bats.

*   Hairless bat: As its name suggests, this molossid bat is largely hairless, though it does have some bristly hairs on its neck and toes. Hailing from Southeast Asia, they’re the largest species of insectivorous bat in the world and also have an opposable thumb on each back foot. I can’t seem to find any hypotheses on why they’re hairless.

*   Sucker-footed bat: Like many weird critters, this is a Madagascan animal. Each of its limbs ends in a cup, from which adhesive fluid is secreted. The bats use these sticky suckers to roost on very smooth leaves that parasites can’t get any purchase on. In 2006, it was discovered that there was a second species, the western sucker-footed bat.

*   Painted bat: This very Halloween-y looking creature is instantly recognizable for its bright colours. While they may seem striking, they actually help the bat camouflage in the dried leaves of Southeast Asia’s arid woodlands. Like most other vesper bats, painted bats use echolocation and catch insects on the wing (this is known as hawking).

*   Proboscis bat: This little bat of the neotropics is enigmatic for two reasons. For one thing, it has an odd, tapir-like trunk (hence the name), which you can see sticking out if you look closely at the image. Secondly, they’re known for their behaviour of roosting in organized, single-file lines along thick branches. They’re usually found near wetlands or water.

*   Hawaiian hoary bat: This one is interesting not for its anatomy, but for its location. Unless you count Hawaiian monk seals, it’s the only native land mammal of the Hawaiian islands, which are too isolated for most large mammals. “Hoary” essentially means “frosted” and refers to the white tips of their fur.

Those are the six species of bat which I find to be the most interesting. Hopefully these qualify as “amazing facts”, and thanks for reading.

I hope you do not run out of amazing species. I truly enjoy your responses.

We observed some proboscis bats in Costa Rica this summer. Here’s my photo showing the same single-file roosting behavior.

A close crop on the same photo shows their namesake proboscis.

Such an interesting animal!

Wierdly enough, I knew that the hoary bat lived in Hawaii before I found out they also occurred throughout much of North and South America, including Michigan where I live.

I need to sell plush versions of the first bats. They hardly look real, they look plush already.

Is the sucker footed business the same thing geckos do?

Great bats! Made me Wiki the white and discovered they’re being studied to help cure or prevent macular degeneration.
```

awwww…they are all so cute! They are like little furry bodied dragons.

The hairless bat looks like a gargoyle!

As usual, Dr. Meaney, your answers are really erudite… they remind me of the wildlife shows I used to watch when I was a kid. This is the first time I read this one and it's great. Bats are really interesting animals. Surely you know about a species in New Zealand that is mostly terrestrial…

Oh I loved reading this post. Thank you!

Amazing there’s no Hawaiian mouse.

It is a great injustice that ‘bats’ were not named ‘cutes’ because that is what they are.
```

Bats are like cute little mouses with wings
```

```
thanks for the enlargeable pics — these bats are dazzling

Amazing little guys!

Sooo which one is the fluffiest that I can MAYBE pet one day??

Also is it inhuman to have one as a pet?
