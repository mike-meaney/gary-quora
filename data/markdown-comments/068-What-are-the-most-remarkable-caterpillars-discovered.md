Ooh, I‚Äôm glad I came across this question. I happen to have a soft spot for caterpillars; they‚Äôre among my favourite arthropods, and they‚Äôre a lot cooler than you think. I know I say that in practically every answer I write, but it‚Äôs true. Here we go, then.

*   Hickory horned devil: This 15-centimeter giant is probably the largest caterpillar in the world. Easily one of the weirdest insects in the contiguous US, its vivid colours and elaborate spikes give it a fearsome appearance, despite it being totally harmless. It metamorphoses into an attractive orange, grey and white moth.

*   Amphibious caterpillars: These 12 species (which, as of yet, have no Latin names) are endemic to Hawaii. They are the only insects which are truly amphibious, and can survive underwater longer than any other air-breathing animal - up to a month! They do this using respiratory pores in their skin and actually require flowing water to breathe.

*   Carnivorous caterpillars: Another Hawaiian endemic, these 3 species in the diverse moth genus Eupithecia are unique for their predatory habits. They lie motionless in wait, mimicking twigs or stems, until an insect flies by, which they snatch using the terrible hooked claws on their forelimbs. Scaled up, these would be terrifying predators.

*   Snail-eating caterpillar: Like the previous creature, this one is both carnivorous and only found in Hawaii. They feed only on land snails, catching them using nets of silk. They then crawl inside the snail‚Äôs shell and eat it alive, from the inside out. And get this - they decorate their bodies with their victim‚Äôs shells, likely for camouflage reasons.

*   Slug caterpillars: The larvae of this family (Limacodidae) are so named for their slug-like appearance. They‚Äôre rotund and gelatinous, and have suckers, rather than legs, on their undersides. They move via rhythmic rippling of their belly and a kind of liquefied silk which functions as a lubricant.

*   Spun glass caterpillar: While it is in the slug caterpillar family, I had to give this one a separate bullet because it‚Äôs so incredibly beautiful. Looking like a handcrafted glass ornament, it‚Äôs covered in transparent crystalline barbs which can give you severe dermatitis if touched. They‚Äôre mainly found on the East Coast of the USA and feed on oak leaves.

*   Jewel caterpillars: This family of moths, Dalceridae, is often confused with the slug caterpillars, as the larvae of both families are gelatinous in appearance. They‚Äôre covered in jelly-like mucus, and when predators - like ants - try to attack, they get stuck in this goop and starve. You should also look up an adult jewel caterpillar moth - they‚Äôre beautiful too.

*   Flannel moth caterpillars: These caterpillars are instantly recognizable, as they‚Äôre covered in a coat of long fur (which is actually venomous setae, so don‚Äôt touch one), which can be yellow, brown, white, or even curly. One species, found in Peru, looks remarkably like Donald Trump‚Äôs hair, which has gained it Internet fame.

*   Hag moth caterpillar: It‚Äôs easy to see why this critter is nicknamed monkey slug, what with its brown furry appearance and limb-like appendages. These ‚Äúarms‚Äù, of which there are six, are able to detach and regrow without any harm to the caterpillar. While some people report no symptoms, others may experience irritation after touching its tufts of setae.

And that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve got, for now anyway. While we‚Äôre here, here‚Äôs a fun fact about caterpillars - they turn into butterflies, right? Wrong. Well, mostly - about 90% of the caterpillars there are, and probably an even higher percentage of those you‚Äôve encountered, metamorphose into moths, not butterflies. Anyway, thanks for reading.

That spun glass, wow!

My flannel moth caterpillars look just like Trump‚Äôs hair, too.

Any idea what kind of caterpillar made this oddity I found on my kitchen door,‚Äù looking like it‚Äôs got claws?
```

The hickory horned devil turns into the regal moth, as I just looked up. Those moths really are beautiful.
```

```
I love this awesome stuff. Thank you! ü¶ã
```

Great material Gary!
```

Amazing!

I think these photos and explanation drive home the point that caterpillars are (from the standpoint of potential predators) large tempting bags of meat. That means they‚Äôve had to evolve ways of discouraging predators, whether through internal toxins or various external means.

Lovely answer thank you!

This is one of those answers that make me wish I could upvote at least 100 times. Thanks.

Didn‚Äôt realise there was such a humongous variety in caterpillars

Gary, you are the coolest cat on all of the internet.

The slug caterpillar is surprisingly pretty, very nice colours!

Also darn you for using the Trump hair joke before I‚Äôd read it and had it in mind XP

Some Quorans are a Pillar of knowledge, and they Cater to our craving of food for thought‚Ä¶

Just WOW and thank you.

Have you ever seen a monarch butterfly chrysalis? It has threads of gold through it. One of the most beautiful things in nature?
```

*imagines a caterpillar version of the Radiance*

Its funny how some of them have evolved to resemble big lumps of bird shit, while others evolved into these amazingly beautiful and other worldly looking creatures like the slug caterpillars and jewel caterpillars, also funny that the ones with slug in their name are amongst the most beautiful. But‚Ä¶

Kinda remind me of Pokemon.

```
The ‚Äúsnail eating caterpillar‚Äù is actually a caddisfly larva. Adult caddisflies resemble small, dull brown moths, but belong to a completely different order.
```

```
Why are there more moths than butterflies from caterpillars? Is that good or bad for plants and stuff?
