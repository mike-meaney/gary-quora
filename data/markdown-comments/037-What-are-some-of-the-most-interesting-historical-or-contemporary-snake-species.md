Glad you asked, these kind of questions are my thing. I nominate the following.

*   The spider-tailed horned viper. This species’ bizarre-looking tail has evolved to mimic a spider; strange, elongated scales give the impression of legs. Insectivorous birds see the “spider”, thinking it a prospective meal, and are snapped up by the viper.

*   The tentacled snake. The most striking feature of these aquatic snakes are the twin “tentacles” on its snout, unique to this species. They are in fact sensory equipment, used to detect the movements of fish in the water. Their hunting strategy is fascinating, too, but too complex to explain in a single bullet.

*   The tiger keelback. Perhaps someone has corrected you smugly that snakes are venomous, not poisonous. Most of the time that’s true, except for this species. The keelback eats poisonous toads and sequesters their irritating toxin, keeping it in glands on their neck and thus being poisonous. Oh, and they’re venomous too.

*   The stiletto snake. This family of serpents has a bizarre skull anatomy, particularly in the fangs - they are angled in such a way that they do not stab downwards, but sideways. Furthermore, they can do this with their mouths closed! The arrangement makes them difficult for scientists to handle.

*   The flying snake. Not exactly obscure, but fascinating nonetheless - these members of the Chrysopelea genus are able to flatten out their ribs, leap out of trees, and glide for up to 100 metres, making them the best gliders in the animal kingdom.

*   The elephant trunk snake. This species is weird for a number reasons - for one thing, its grey skin is baggy and loose, hence the name. Secondly, they have no scales on their belly, meaning they can’t move outside water. Third, what scales they do have are sharp and rough, and used to attach to fish as the snakes eats them.

*   The emerald tree boa. Outwardly, it looks perfectly normal, and indeed it is a well-known species. However, when it opens its mouth, it reveals its monstrous teeth - the largest of any snake, for its size. These are an adaptation for hunting mammals and birds in the trees.

*   Since you’re including past snakes, Palaeophiidae. This extinct family survived the end-Cretaceous extinction and lasted until 33 million years ago. They were fully marine, and warm-blooded - they probably gave live birth, too. Worst of all, the largest species, Palaeophis colossaeus, was over 9 metres long - I’d rather take my chances with Titanoboa, thanks.

So there you have it - 8 slithering proofs that snakes are a lot more diverse than the average person likely thinks.

A Wikipedia article on snakes I read referred to them as a “garbage bin taxon” when talking about their evolution. I was just curious what your take is on that?
```

```
Would you mind elaborating on the tentacled snake?
```

```
Imagine being in a jungle, and then WHAM

Gliding snake.
```

```
So did Palaeophis colossaeus actually have rear flippers? And do we know if they were vestigial leg remnents given new purpose or some other structure?
```

```
No On a lighter note came to know of this interesting snake, thought i will share.
```

A wonderful answer, but if you have included their geographic information, it would have been more interesting. Good one!!
