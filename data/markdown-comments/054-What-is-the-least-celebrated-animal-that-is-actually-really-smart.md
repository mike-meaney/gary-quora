From spotted hyenas to sun bears, there are lot of candidates, but I’m going to go with manta rays.

If you were to take a logarithmic graph, and plot every species of animal on it based on their body mass and brain mass, it’d tell you each one’s Encephalization Quotient, or EQ. In general, more intelligent animals have higher EQs (however, there are caveats to this, as dinosaurs, including birds, seem to have much denser neural tissue than mammals).

If you then took a close look at this graph, you’d notice something quite fascinating. Manta rays would be apart from all the other fish, instead clustered among the mammals. The EQ of the giant oceanic manta ray is higher than that of the brown rat, which - for a fish - is very impressive.

However, relative brain size alone an intelligent animal does not make. Mantas are also demonstrate their intellect through behaviour. In 2016, [research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10164-016-0462-z "link.springer.com") was done on manta rays where captive individuals were presented with a mirror. This “mirror test” has been given to many animal species, but few have passed.

The idea is that if an animal recognizes itself in the mirror, it might be self-aware (this is another thing in ethology which has caveats to consider, but it’d take too long to explain them here). The tested manta rays certainly seemed to recognize themselves, acting very differently to how they would with another individual:

The researchers found that, I quote:

> The manta rays did not show signs of social interaction with their mirror image. However, frequent unusual and repetitive movements in front of the mirror suggested contingency checking; in addition, unusual self-directed behaviors could be identified when the manta rays were exposed to the mirror.

Overall, while it certainly isn’t conclusive proof that manta rays are self-aware, it does at least show that they seem to be more intelligent than any other fish studied thus far. They show plenty of signs of intelligence in other aspects of their behaviour, such as their curiosity and deep social bonds.

I think that all this goes to show that being able to manufacture and use tools is not as importance to the evolution of powerful brains as some might think. Anatomically, a manta ray couldn’t be less suited to tool use, and yet it is a remarkably smart creature.

The one that fascinates me is the short-beaked echidna - it has a *huge* brain for its size, but just eats ants and is almost predator-proof. It must have had an ancestor who was full-bore predator or prey quite recently.

I have some anecdotal proof of their intelligence: one morning a pair of mantas were cavorting right off a Maui beach. I had about 30 minutes alone with them, but then 15 or 20 snorkelers joined us and I ceded the field, and watched while the rays “led” their fans over to a rocky point, and then “sn…

“I think that all this goes to show that being able to manufacture and use tools is not as importance to the evolution of powerful brains as some might think.” Right, that’s because tool use is only one aspect of problem-solving. The thing that makes our brains unique is our capacity for abstraction.…

Fascinating! I was lucky enough to swim with a giant manta ray in the Galápagos Islands - it cruised up, circled a couple feet away and seemed to be checking us out, hung around for 20 minutes or so and then swam back off into the deep.

It was just cool to see one in its natural habitat.

Next to cephalopods, another of my favorites. Is this celebrate my favorites week? Heh.

The comparison fails a bit with octopus as well. Some species show quite high intellect with a, for us, very alien nerve structure. The octopus brain has sort of outsourced a lot of the processing.

Fascinating. Thank you.

Cool! Pity the clip isn’t longer.

Another great answer. Cheers.

I’m a big believer in viewing intelligence within the context of what a particular animal needs rather than grading it according to a human scale, as was the standard for a long time. I’m glad to see more studies are designed with with the psychology and physiology of different species in mind, as i…

I speculate that there is something about the plankton-filtering-large-animal life that encourages brain development. Perhaps it is the necessity of migrating around the world’s oceans in search of plankton concentrations thick enough to be “economical” (for the animals) that does it. Filtering plan…

Considering how these rays act round people, they’re definitely self aware.

and super-friendly!

Didn’t Erwin get killed by one of them?
