The wildlife situation around Chernobyl currently is something of a controversy in science. [This 2016 paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0096340211399747 "journals.sagepub.com") says that:

> With few exceptions, wildlife in the zone shows a strong pattern of declining abundance

However, many other scientists say that the local fauna is clearly on the rise, and the popular media seems to have almost invariably gone with their conclusions.

In any case, since - as far as I’m aware - all the studies saying that Chernobyl’s wildlife is in decline are by the same two authors, whereas there are several different biologists who have written papers on increasing animal populations in the area, I’ll assume that the latter are correct for now.

Various camera trapping operations have revealed that the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has grown a healthy population of large mammals, such as grey wolves:

European badgers:

Wild boar:

Roe deer:

And even moose:

There are also abundant smaller mammals, including Eurasian beavers, least weasels and voles. Among the birds, there are some “flashy” species, such as the enormous white-tailed sea eagle (Europe’s largest raptor):

And black storks:

And that’s just the native wildlife. Since the disaster, people have released other Eurasian mammals into this involuntary oasis, including European bison:

And wild Przewalski’s horses:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bae09491832f29e96ab20ddf2f9c1cf6-lq)

There’s even evidence that animals not seen in the region for over a century are returning, including Eurasian lynx:

And brown bears:

It’s pretty amazing, and also rather sobering, to think that the sheer presence of humans was worse for the environment than a catastrophic nuclear disaster.

“The wildlife situation around Chernobyl currently is something of a controversy in science” No, it is not… because I have a very good hunch about who the authors of that paper are. *click* *read* Mm hm, I was right: Mousseau and Møller. Mousseau and Møller are the Andrew Wakefields of this issue, i.e. t…

The 2016, based on publishing date, is bothersome. Basically it boils down to 3 issues: 1. The bulk of the references is to material the authors wrote prior. Now this isn't really a red flag because if you are the only one writing on something you may be the only reference. Also if this work is one in a…

It's good to know that after we've destroyed our own biome and died off, the elk, bison, and boar will thrive.

Ironic. Homo sapiens beat nuclear disasters when it comes to devastation to the environment.
```

```
What a great irony it would be that when the region is declared safe, it will named as a national park to protect the animals. But one thing worries me. Just hate to think of storks living there. Storks bring babies! Chernobyl storks will bring radioactive mutant babies. Eurasia will soon be populated…

If there is decline it might be possible that radiation from the cooling pools might be spreading via evaporation and rain, or just water runoff into other sources such as nearby streams, and that might be causing infertility, or atleast lowering the sperm count and viability of eggs of local fauna…
```

```
Many years ago I saw a documentary on that subject, and believe to remember it was assumed that one of the reasons wildlife is not suffering the negative long-term effects of radiation in that area is that their life-span is so short and they reach sexual maturity and reproductive age quickly after…

“It’s pretty amazing, and also rather sobering, to think that the sheer presence of humans was worse for the environment than a catastrophic nuclear disaster.”

Beautifully written and painfully true, couldn't agree more.

Wow, that last sentence! Amazing observation.
```

```
That's an extreme status of biodiversity. And only mammals and birds were mentioned.
```

```
You've left out the most important fact: they all glow at night.

Very disingenuous of you.

what beautiful pix. thanks.
```

```
That Lynx is beautiful and a really “cool cat”!

And that's not even counting the ones that got radiation-induced superpowers, like the majestic invisible elephants.

Brilliant conclusion.

That boar gives me clear sky flashbacks

“the sheer presence of humans was worse for the environment than a catastrophic nuclear disaster”. Loved this lines

What a fantastic last sentence.

My God!

What you said is very much true.

What an awesome answer :)

That last line is depressing but the truth.

That last sentence….

Or rather damage to wildlife from radioactive fallout is small, negligible after just a couple years when all short lived isotopes are gone.

Damage from radiation to wildlife is nothing compared from toxic wastes released by regular activity (

But no giant radiated ursids to prowl on unsuspecting villages? Grrr, my DNA sequence has changed. Fear me.

This reminds me of the dog rescues that operate in the area — trying to help dogs in the zone survive, vaccinating and desexing them, taking the ones they can back to be cleaned up, decontaminated and offered for adoption. Apparently the winters are the biggest risk, most are young and don't live lon…

Well I think this is why Godzilla kept stomping human cities to oblivion. He is doing animal kingdom a favor by removing the true threat to Nature - humans.

Yay! The one place in the entire world where grey wolves are probably safe from being chased for hours by rich, lazy trophy hunters in helicopters.

I was in Moscow once and went to the Sanduny banya. I chanced a conversation with a man who said he was from Chernobyl. I said: Awful what happened there. He replied: Oh no. Now we have strawberries as big as basketball.

I have also heard that many animals are suffering from unhealthy mutations from the radioactive exposure, not the whole populations but individuals and sometimes groups.

Are there any Amur Leopards around the Chernobyl power plant?

The “catastrophic nuclear disaster” consists of elevated cancer rates that mainly affect people/animals in old age, long after they’ve reproduced and have thus fulfilled their evolutionary purpose. The exclusion zone could easily host millions of humans too, if we didn’t care about cancer. Maybe the…

No mention of the radroaches, mole rats, deathclaws, ghouls and supermutants?

Real nuclear disasters (all two ones of them!) are so boring compared to fiction… More people probably died in Ukraine falling from stools while trying to reach pots in high shelves… in 2018 alone.
```

```
Are you sure these are pictures from around Chernobyl? I don’t see three eyes on any of those critters.

:) I’m kidding.

I think of this as one of mother nature’s happy little reminders that humans can be replaced.
```

```
It’s true that the most effective conservation efforts is to let nature take its course. Basically, if we stay in our habitat, they can stay in theirs and everyone will thrive. (Don’t get me started on the guy jogging alone in the woods who was attacked by a mountain lion cub and was praised for str…

It could be both. As the area reverts to more wilderness, it hosts more wildlife. But that wildlife is negatively impacted by the contamination. Showing a bunch of photos like this is hardly evidence of anything.
```

```
Not entirely scientific either, I’ve been watching quite a lot of videos recently about rewilding projects and the results are empirical but seem pretty remarkable.

```
Oddly I remember reading that Fukushima also had/had wild boars after their nuclear accident. I wonder if they just tolerate radiation and the environment better than other animals.
```

```
Is it just me, or is there something weird about the photo of the horses?
```

```
My guess is that the meat and fur are radioactive and unsuitable for humans.
```

```
“It’s pretty amazing, and also rather sobering, to think that the sheer presence of humans was worse for the environment than a catastrophic nuclear disaster.”

🤣🤣🤣
```

```
I heard a few anecdotal reports that wildlife is indeed thriving in Chernobyl area.
```

```
I find something of a strong analogy here:

Humans talk, discuss, build and neglect, then further abandon.

Animals just find a place and do it!
```

```
There are quite a lot of amnormalities in animals living in the exclusion zone, so saying that the animals fare worse with people around is a bit uncertain.
```

```
Interesting, I would be curious to see what differences animals of the same species have between a clean environment and the radioactive one.
```

```
Anything glow in the dark?
```

```
I was one to believe the claims that animals were flourishing in the exclusion zone because people don’t live there.
```

```
Animals may indeed be reproducing and ‘thriving’ w/o humans, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re all ‘healthy’.

A documentary showed the misshapen webs of the spiders living there now - many spider generations after the accident. I thought it was one of the saddest things I have ever seen.

Are all these animals destines for an early death coursed by radiation? If not, then why continue to make the area uninhabitable?

Aren't the animals suffering from the effects of radiation?
