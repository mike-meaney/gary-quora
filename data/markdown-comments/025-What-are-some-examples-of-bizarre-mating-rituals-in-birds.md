The blue-backed manakin has a fascinating, and indeed counter-intuitive, courtship ritual. In almost all animals, when the male tries to impress the female, he does so competitively. Blue-backed manakins, on the other hand, do this cooperatively.

Several males, which are blue and black with a bright red cap, line up on a twig in view of a female. They then perform a dance together, with one on the far side hopping up, and then fluttering to the back of the line. They all take turns in this way.

The result is a courtship display much more impressive than one which is performed solo, but the question remains - since only one will get to mate, why do the others cooperate? At the end of the day, it could be any of them who the female selects, so by teaming up they increase everybody’s chances.

Sometimes, it’s better to work together - even with your fiercest competitors.

Two thoughts…if the males share DNA, they could be doing the same thing as brother whales. With 2/3rds shared DNA two brother achieve the DNA’s function.Moon By Whale Light
 Thought Number two, is this related to Nash’s game theory?

And the rationale for the wingman when going to a club… works with people just as well.

pretty cool… are you sure that they don’t orgy afterwards?

One theory I’ve heard is that the males cooperate with related males, so, even though only one is going to pass on his genes, his success means the success of the whole bloodline in a sense (or that the relatives have, at least, succeeded in part of their genes being passed on).

This is why guys are wing-men for each other.

Honestly the first thing I thought was red trump hair-do.

Now that is what I call a bird-brained move! :)

Imagine if humans were like that…
