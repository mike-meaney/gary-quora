That would be the coconut crab. It‚Äôs not only the largest terrestrial arthropod commonly eaten by humans, but it‚Äôs the largest terrestrial invertebrate, full stop.

This colossal crustacean can weigh up to four kilograms, and its leg span measures a metre across! When coconut crabs start out in life, however, they look nothing like that - in fact, the babies (known as zoae) begin as microscopic plankton floating in the sea.

If these teeny weeny larvae survive long enough, they metamorphose into larger forms, called glaucothoes. The glaucothoes find seashells - or, sometimes, broken coconut shells - to wear as protection from predators.

Eventually, they surface and take to dry land, growing larger still and shedding their old shell. Instead, they develop a remarkably tough exoskeleton, reinforced with chitin and calcite. This has a defensive purpose, but also serves to prevent water loss outside the sea - one of the many adaptations coconut crabs have for the terrestrial way of life.

In my opinion, the most interesting of these adaptations is their respiratory system. They have a very unique organ called a branchiostegal lung, essentially an inside-out set of gills which absorbs atmospheric oxygen, rather than the dissolved oxygen of the sea. This has to be kept moist at all times, so they frequently use their back legs to rub it with water.

Coconut crabs also have an excellent sense of smell, which of course works very differently to that of their aquatic relatives. Interestingly enough, their olfaction is quite similar to that of insects, a case of convergent evolution.

As you can probably guess, this sense of smell is used to track down food. They usually eat fruit, nuts, coconuts, seeds, and the like, but they are far from fussy, and will gladly eat carrion, or even kill live rats, turtles, and seabirds! The photo below is a pretty damn nightmarish shot.

Speaking of eating, and more relevant to your question, coconut crabs are considered a traditional delicacy on many of the islands they inhabit, especially the more remote ones. This is one of the main threats to the species, as they are classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN.

That being said, it‚Äôs possible that the crabs have had their revenge against us humans. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre all familiar with Amelia Earhart, the pilot who had to make an emergency landing on a far-flung isle of Kiribati, and whose remains were never found.

Believe it or not, some people theorize that this is because her body was picked clean by scavenging coconut crabs‚Ä¶

Though it may seem far-fetched, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs certainly plausible. While investigating this, TIGHAR (The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery) ran an experiment involving coconut crabs and a large pig carcass. It was stripped to the bone in a couple of weeks, and its skeleton was dismantled by the crabs shortly thereafter.

Now, some bonus facts which are worth knowing about these guys. The coconut crab has a pretty far-reaching distribution across much of the Indian Ocean, and some of the Pacific, too. It‚Äôs found (mainly on small islands) from East Africa to Southeast Asia to French Polynesia.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-38f71d5e15d711d92699cb98c20c545a)

The wicked claws of the coconut crab are a serious force to be reckoned with. Their pinch strength has been measured at a bone-cracking 3,000 newtons, in comparison to studies which find the average man‚Äôs pinch grip to be 87 newtons!

Anyway, hopefully that was a good rundown of this unusual and frighteningly huge species of arthropod. I myself would be curious to taste one, though hopefully I would not befall the alleged fate of Amelia Earhart and be tasted.

Thank you very much for reading, have a great day.

How do they stack up taste wise among crab aficionados? Are they considered more on the meh side, or comparable to those delicious Alaska crabs?
```

```
In regards to their range, you‚Äôre absolutely correct that their range is pretty broad right now - but it used to be even broader (before, yknow, people. sigh). They apparently vibed on the coast of mainland Australia, Madagascar, and possibly even South Africa. And after all these millions of years,‚Ä¶

My great grandpa was with the 1st Marine div. in the pacific in WW2, he had lots of horror stories about coconut crabs crawling out of every nook and cranny come nightfall to go after the dead.

I was ill in wintry Minnesota with an odd constellation of minor symptoms.

I've always thought that coconut crabs must be delicious‚Ä¶

But given that they are classified as vulnerable, I wouldn't eat them. Unless I was shipwrecked I suppose.

Hello Gary Meaney, may I send you a pm? There's a rather odd creature that I thought perhaps you might have a take on.

I‚Äôll let you know if I get to try coconut crab, am supposed to be traveling that way in 2023 for a month or two. After reading your article, thank you for sharing, at least I won‚Äôt die of fright if I happen to meet a living one.
```

```
Excellent synopsis. I live in Samoa and yes they fetch a high price or good favour (the latter being more likely). As you said these monsters will eat ‚Äúanything‚Äù and have to be cleaned out for a week before you feast. Taro leaves a.k.a. spinach is the choice here. Be careful as people have lost fing‚Ä¶
```

```
Just how hard would these animals be to farm? Is it even feasible? Would there even be a market?

Just wondering, because it looks like you could feed it non commercially sellable fruit and vegetables.

I‚Äôve eaten coconut crab, on Vanuatu. Delicious but not as delicate as smaller types of crabs. I drew the line though at eating the belly contents, which the locals call pate from the ‚Äúbig bol‚Äù. Oily looking, no doubt very edible, but‚Ä¶

I live on Guam. Never seen them as large as a trashcan, but they can definitely be over a foot claw to claw spread out. They also clean up good, dog waste, food scraps, fruits falling from trees that might rot. They pretty much come out at night and clean up the mess. I can throw out a plate of food‚Ä¶
```

```
I‚Äôve actually eaten them twice and two different ways. In Vanuatu, we had them wrapped whole in banana leaves and cooked in a hungi type fire pit. Straight out of the shell with no added flavours, they had a slight crab/fish flavour and a definite coconut taste that was a bit stronger than cocnut ric‚Ä¶

Fill the trash can in your top photo full of melted butter and let that sucker crawl right in!

I‚Äôm curious about the photo of the crab on a trash barrel. Is it scavenging‚Äîtrying to get in to get garbage, like a raccoon would?
```

Very good breakdown. Good read. Thanks.

Are they commercially bred for food? I can imagine them being quite scrumptious.

These gills look very similar to the book lungs of spiders

About 17 years ago I tried to pick up a coconut crab in Niue. Big mistake. It was a relatively small one but it was able to articulate its legs much further than the sand crabs I was used to picking up on the beaches in NZ and I very quickly put it back down (nicely) before I lost a finger. They see‚Ä¶

Their pinch strength of 3000 N and possible dismantling of skeleton drew a gruesome picture for me.
```

```
Yuk! I seriously hope never to set eyes on a live example.
```

```
Paint it black and everyone would run for their lives.
```

```
They are also called Robber Crabs as they like shiny things, and have been known to raid tents and run off with cutlery and other shiny objects.
```

```
Those things are freaky! They taste any good?
```

```
I‚Äôm going to guess Stephen King based the nightmarish crab-things in the second book of his Dark Tower series on these‚Ä¶ :-)
```

```
That would have me screaming into the night.
```

```
Great answer!
```

```
Is the bird that the coconut crab was eating, a species of gannet? Looks really similar to one. Awesome answer as always!!!! I feel spoiled seeing all the answers you keep making recentlyüòÅ
```

```
Hey Gary! Amazing answer as always! Could you recommend me any other Quorans with content and quality similiar to your stuff? I struggle a bit with finding interesting Quorans right now.
```

```
I would still like to get one. Of course with some lemon, butter and old bay
```

```
They can also fall on your damn head.
```

```
I think it‚Äòs astonishing that the largest terrestrial invertebrate is only about one meter in size and the largest aquatic invertebrate (The Collossal Squid) can be over 15m long!! (And the coconut crab even ‚Äûcame‚Äú from the sea‚Ä¶). The ocean really is a madly interesting place!
```

```
What is their age when they weigh 4 kilograms?
```

```
I'm not sure about them being commonly eaten by humans. I live in Southeast Asia by the way and I've never heard of a dish with coconut crab in it.
```

```
The only criticism I can make of this answer is that you would have to be pretty desperate to eat them. My experience has been in Kiribati, and according to the locals, they taste foul.

I took their word for it.
```

```
would not want to run into that
```

```
‚ÄúThat would be the coconut crab. It‚Äôs not only the largest terrestrial arthropod commonly eaten by humans, but it‚Äôs the largest terrestrial invertebrate, full stop.‚Äù

Depends on how you define ‚Äòlarge‚Äô.

Is there any test to measure pinch strength of giant Tasmanian crab and king crab? they are far bigger than coconut crab but they seem less agressive to pinch.
```

```
I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre endangered, where can I eat one in the US?
```

```
I had been miseducated that the term was metamorphosize. Now I should realize the term should be metamorphose.
```

```
Nice answer but you missed a key question - is the Coconut Crab good eatin‚Äô?
```

```
Amelia Earhart was shot down by the Japanese, captured, interrogated and then executed.
```

```
Zip up your tent if you sleep on the beach.

Alaskan here. If that thing was at all tasty it would be hunted to oblivion.

I would check myself into an insane asylum if I saw that bastard on my trashcan. ‚ÄúNope, I don‚Äôt need to go outside ever again.‚Äù
```

```
Interesting. Informative. Well-written.
Saw the first picture‚Ä¶.
Gee, thanks for the nightmare tonight‚Ä¶.
```

```
Delicious eating. Yummm! I had some at a restaurant in Port Vila, Vanuatu when on a South Pacific cruise about 7 years ago. And very filling.
```

```
Beautiful stuff as always, Gary. If only I had time to read them all :>(

That was very interesting! Thank you!
