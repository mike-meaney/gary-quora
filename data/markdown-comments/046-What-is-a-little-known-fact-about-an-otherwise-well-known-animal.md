Sharks. Everyone knows sharks - many love them, many fear them. However, they have a particular grotesque habit which few are aware of: gastric eversion.

Have a look at the photo above. Did you notice something in the shark’s mouth? It’s not prey, nor is it a tongue - it’s the shark’s stomach.

There might have been something harmful in there, such as an indigestible item, a parasite or a buildup of mucus. Or, more likely in this particular case, the person behind the camera triggered its fight-or-flight instincts and it’s “ejecting” the extra weight to make a quick getaway.

It’s thought that all sharks possess this ability; their stomach turns inside out, gets pushed out of the mouth, and is quickly retracted. Here’s a beached specimen with its stomach everted:

Plus one studied in a laboratory. Both are shortfin makos.

As it happens, this ability isn’t limited to sharks. Their close relatives the rays also do it, in what is more commonly known as stomach rinsing.

Some rays, such as manta rays, can also perform intestinal eversion, which is done, well… out the other end.

Gastric eversion has also evolved independently in echinoderms such as sea stars, sea cucumbers and sea urchins, and in frogs. To make matters more nauseating, frogs will often use their hands to stroke the heaved-up organ, making sure the nasty stuff gets cleaned away.

So, I’m sure none of you had any intention of seeing this on your dash today, but our beloved algorithm has brought it to you anyway. I’d say have a nice a day, like I usually do, but I think after this read that’s a bit of a big ask.

In any case, take this from this piece: vomiting might not be pleasant, but at least humans don’t retch up their distended stomachs instead.

Are you sure about that? I've heard some wild rumours about the Kardashians!
```

Thanks. I think. I found that absolutely gripping — and I couldn’t prise it off me until I’d read to the end. Well done.
```

```
Wow Gary that’s awesome. Thank you. Once again you’ve told me something I probably never would have known.
```

```
Aversion to eversion, but “naturalia non sunt turpia”. To spare you the googling: “what is natural is not shameful”.

How come the sharks don’t slice their stomach with their ultra-sharp teeth, while eversioning?…
```

```
Nice trick! I'd love to have this ability, well sometimes anyway. Hangups and gastroendoscopy are dreadful.
```

```
This answer is representative of what Quora is for. My opinion.
```

```
Ahh, I saw a frog doing that as a kid! I thought it was run over by someone and its guts got squished out! 😵
```

```
Fascinating. NGL, I've had times where this would have been useful.

That said, do their teeth not cut the everted stomach?
```

```
I'll get you next time, The Algorithm! Next time!!
```

```
I have seen a frog with it's everted stomach a couple of times. I did wonder what the hell it was…
```

```
Bulimia perfected!
```

```
I don’t get it, they spit out their stomach and leave it floating around and then come back and get it? Or no?
```

```
Very interesting, Gary, thanks! I knew that about sharks but didn’t know it about frogs and I’ve never seen it in rays! While SCUBA diving, I’ve seen sea cucumbers on the ocean floor doing whatever it is they are doing, since I can’t tell one end from the other sometimes, it could be either!
```

```
Very interesting stuff I never knew and rather gross at the same time … bravo monsiuer you own Quora today
```

```
How absolutely revolting
```

```
Thank you Gary - I learned something new and fascinating.
```

```
Lmao, the algorithm blessed me with this beautiful post as I was eating a sandwich.
```

```
You go, Gary!
```

```
Looks like an advanced level of vomiting. We humans are just noob. :)
```

```
This is really gross but really cool
```

As far as I know, the true champions are starfish. They don't just evert their stomach to clean it, they even eat that way. 1. Find a nice clam or mussel. 2. Use suction feet to grab both halves of the shell. 3. Pry the shell halves apart a little. 4. Evert stomach and insert into bivalve. Start digesting. 5. Pull stom…

But wait a minute… How does the shark avoid damaging its stomach with its teeth?
```

```
Animals are so incredible, along with the rest of life! It's really sad that we are all destroying the planet without even batting an eyelash at it. Our greed is destroying the world, and we are the only ones that can undo all of it. If we don't….then there will be serious consequences. God's Garden:…
```

```
It’s not like we can ask them, but I’m assuming retching out one’s stomach or blowing out their bowels isn’t pleasant for them.
```

```
Begging your pardon, Gary Meaney, we humans may not retch up our entire stomachs, but y'know when we technicolour-yawn, there's always carrots? Even having not eaten any? I have it on good medical authority that those “carrots" are chunks of - er - stomach lining. So, a bit more evolution, & we'll b…
```

```
I'm wondering do sharks have intestines beside the stomach? Also, how they reattach the tissues after they throw up? I reckon they cut the tissues, or at least this is what I understood 🤔
```

```
Why is this grotesque? Nature works in mysterious ways…I for sure would consider it a blessing to be able to cleanse my stomach this easy way!
```

```
Some humans do have the rather unfortunate ability to at least partially do this in the nether regions in the form of a prolapse. Google image it. I dare you.
```

```
that is so very cool. Thanks
```

```
Another thing too, sharks are incredibly smooth. The smoothest creatures EVER. Rub your hand against them really quickly trust me
```

```
Wow yuck but never ever heard that one before.

Jesus cares say your prayers Amen
