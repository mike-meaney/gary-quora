With hundreds of thousands of Amazonian species to choose from, this was a tricky one, but I have resolved to nominate the common Surinam toad. What constitutes ugliness is of course a subjective concept, but this amphibian sure won‚Äôt be winning any conventional beauty contests.

The common Surinam toad is a rather rectangular creature found across the Amazon basin. Its tiny eyeballs and muddy brown colour don‚Äôt do it many aesthetic favours, but when the females start to give birth, things get really ugly.

During mating, the female releases eggs, which the male fertilizes and embeds in her skin. These eggs gradually sink deeper and deeper into their mother‚Äôs back, eventually forming a scattering of pits. While they develop, she has the strange pockmarked appearance pictured above. Then things get weirder still.

After the eggs hatch, the newborn tadpoles stay inside their pockets, eventually growing into fully formed adult toads. They all crawl out of their mother at this stage, in a gooey exodus. Finally, the mother sheds the honeycombed layer of skin off her back in place of a fresh one.

While the common Surinam toad may indeed be ugly, you can‚Äôt deny that it is equally fascinating, for a number of reasons in addition to what I just described. Uniquely, these toads do not croak; rather, the males produce rapid, throaty clicks with their tongue bone. Funnily enough, they don‚Äôt have actual tongues.

Another cool feature of this species are the tiny star-shaped growths they have on their toes, used for gripping slippery prey. You can see them in the photo below if you look closely.

Anyway, thank you very much for reading everybody. Apologies for my recent lack of activity - I‚Äôve been quite busy recently, but I sure don‚Äôt plan on stopping any time soon. I hope you enjoyed the answer, and have a great day.

And just think, these are features that wouldn‚Äôt fossilise well, so some of the early amphibians may have been just as bizarre.

You had me at ‚Äúrather rectangular‚Äù
```

Mama Surinam toad to Papa Surinam toad: ‚ÄúI'm telling you, Ted, you gotta get the kids off my back‚Ä¶they're really getting under my skin!‚Äù

Have empathy towards the common Surinam toad. It leads a harsh life.
```

```
In the first picture, she looks like a cross between a many-eyed spider and a Toaster Strudel.
```

```
Ah yes, I woke up today and thought‚Ä¶ I could use a dose of trypophobia. Thanks for that!
```

```
wouldnt want to run into that
```

```
I thought that you wer gonna say that the babies feed on the mother, like the octopus babies do.

Looks like great camouflage. Betting they are not the delicacy of the Amazon fauna.
```

```
‚ÄúHere we see a Pop-tart in the wild‚Äù
```

```
If ever the ‚ÄúGo home evolution, you‚Äôre drunk‚Äù meme applied‚Ä¶
```

I'm sure I once saw time-lapse footage of the eggs growing into the mother's back, maybe on an early Attenborough. They must have immobilised the toad and hand fed it. Probably only for a few days as it was only the eggs not the hatching. It was kinda gruesome.
```

```
Good grief! It looks like it‚Äôs been run over by a truck!
```

```
It's not really ugly. It's just‚Ä¶a little weird. Like fried squid done different or something.
```

```
Truly fascinating, marvelous stuff.
```

```
Gross! But oddly fascinating.
Thanks, Gary!
```

```
If I saw this in the wild I would literally think it was a dead squished frog. I have learned something today. üòÇ
```

```
‚Äúbut I sure don‚Äôt plan on stopping any time soon‚Äù Good to hear! \o/
```

```
Evolution: okay so what features are we going to add to your kind?

Frog: make us look like roadkill so people would assume we are already dead
```

```
Gooey Exodus would make a great band name. Thanks for another brilliantly written answer Gary, your posts are always a highlight.
```

```
Excellent, but I have to stop looking while I eat.
```

```
Knew of this creature, but not with the excellent detail you brought to this answer. Fascinating.
```

```
JC, and I thought women had it bad‚Ä¶
```

```
Thanks! Your posts are always fascinating.
```

```
Creepy but very interesting‚Ä¶‚Ä¶thanks, Gary
```

```
Extremely ugly. Practically undateable.
```

```
That toad is awesome!! I love the stars on the feet‚Ä¶ so cool‚Ä¶ thanks for this post I‚Äôve never heard of this guy before‚Ä¶
```

```
I find it very cute, but I will say that the holes do not look comfortable or calming at all to meüòÇ It is otherwise cute to me.
```

```
Amazonian gremlins
```

```
Yay! You‚Äôre back! Love reading your posts!
```

```
WHY WOULD YOU POST THAT! Cripes- now I‚Äôm never getting any sleep.
```

```
‚Ä¶ weirder still from the pictures it‚Äôs hard to tell if they‚Äôre coming or going.
```

```
This was extremely interesting! They‚Äôre cute in a ET kinda way. Thanks for sharing
```

```
Yep I agree it‚Äôs not that ‚Äúgorgeous ‚Äú lol but yet is still amazing and can give birth to so many at once! Would the offspring be called ‚Äú multiple-let‚Äôs?‚Äù
```

```
Looks like a choco chip cookie.
Tasty.
```

```
Zounds!!! This thing hit every branch and leaf in its fall down the ugly tree. That being said it is an extremely interesting beastie.
```

```
That Full on looks like a Mayan character!
```

```
Ah yes, the good ol‚Äô tryptophobia frog.
```

```
Fascinating and highly informative! I thoroughly enjoyed your writing and descriptions. Thank you
```

```
Great answer. Thanks for posting !
```

```
Thanks for triggering my trypophobia. I shudder every time I see photos or video of this interesting animal.
```

```
Remarkable!
```

```
would make a good sandwich
```

```
Oh my god I hate it.
```

```
I love the expression ‚Äúa rather rectangular creature‚Äù. Not sure why but it makes me laugh. Maybe I should consult.
```

```
Oh, lord. That is so disgusting, I wish I could un-know it!

Well-nominated, sir. :O
```

```
Yeuuch!!
```

```
Ugliest animal? I will say unconventional look - I wont say ugliest.. I guess those species might be saying same about human race :-)
```

```
I would argue the ugliest creature in the Amazon is a human being hellbent on exterminating native dwellers and animals, clear cutting rainforest, and setting devastating wildfires. There is no comparison to the darkness in their souls.
```

```
Could it be interpreted as one of the earliest instances in nature of appearance of a placenta like structure in animals?
```

```
They look like they'd be kings of the limbo.
```

```
How does the tadpoles feed?
```

```
Is it a mammal?
```

```
You know, this is one of those species I wouldn‚Äôt mind not existing. Ick
```

```
Adult toads‚Ä¶.that means that those things would get really huge, about the size of the mother. Is that right?
```

```
Caviar
