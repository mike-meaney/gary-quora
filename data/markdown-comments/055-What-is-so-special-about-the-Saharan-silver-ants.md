I did promise you guys that I’d write a full answer on Saharan silver ants, and it appears one of my readers has gone to the trouble of asking me the question for it!

These ants are truly remarkable creatures, easily one of the most interesting species in an already fascinating group. They can be found all across the more northern swathe of the Sahara Desert, a truly extreme habitat which has forced them to undergo some equally extreme adaptations. Here is why they are so unique.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-216595d8aad1742e5f5bcf97f3807f2a)

Living out in the deserts, these insects are faced with a problem. All through the night and for most of the day, predators like lizards run amok. This leaves only a daily ten minute window in which they can emerge from their nest and look for food. There’s only one drawback - the reason there are no predators about during this window is because it’s midday, when the heat is absolutely blistering.

But the tough little critters are up to the challenge. They can withstand up to 53.6 degrees Celsius (128 Fahrenheit) by producing incredible molecules called heat shock proteins, which help maintain cell structure during extreme temperatures.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-691f78a7d12c60cf8430540cdd03418b-lq)

All living things use heat shock proteins, but the ants are the only organisms in the world which can manufacture them at will, before they surface, instead of as an automated response to heat after the fact.

Another way that Saharan silver ants resist the beating sun is with their signature coat of silvery hair. They are not cylindrical in shape, like most animals’ hairs, but rather they are triangular prisms. This structure makes them highly reflective; in fact, they reflect away over 90% of the light which hits them. This is why they look so shiny, of course.

In order to gather enough food to feed an entire colony for a day in just ten minutes, they have to be quick - very, very quick. In fact, relative to their size, Saharan silver ants are the third-fastest organisms on the planet, topped only by a species of tiger beetle and a [Californian mite](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-animal-faster-than-a-cheetah/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com").

They can cover a full metre in a little over a second, which is over 100 times their body length! Very interestingly, they run with their front legs lifted off the ground (perhaps to increase speed, or reduce contact with the searing-hot earth), making them one of the very few quadrupedal invertebrates.

So, have I convinced you that they’re special? You could make a strong case for ants as the most fascinating of all the insect groups, and Saharan silver ants are part of the reason why. Thank you for reading everyone, I hope you enjoyed this answer, and have a great day.

To clarify the ten minute window - the writing makes it sound like it is specifically the ten minutes of time near midday when it is the hottest. Rather the ants wait until temps first become hot enough that the lizard species that is their main predator cannot survive outside. At that point it is s…

Great answer! Do these chromed up suckers get lowered with hydraulics and subwoofers?
```

```
Cool! Or…hot, maybe. Now I am curious about what the ants can find to eat? I think of ants looking for sugar or pet food or aphids but where can they find that out in that desert?
```

```
Where do these ants find water if emerging in the heat of the midday sun in the desert and travel radius is restricted to 5 minutes (so they have 10 min round trip)? Do they live near oases? Do they create deep burrows since desert sand gets blown about in the winds?
```

```
Thank you Gary. I love species profiles and natural histories like this. They take me back to my first well-defined love in science—not human anatomy and physiology, as some might think if they read my posts—but invertebrate zoology and animal behavior. Two other things fascinate me about the Saharan…
```

```
Wait, if you’ve never written about them before, I’ve read of them elsewhere, remembered when you mentioned their mid-day heat trick! But I don’t remember anything about their front legs — are you saying they actually run those mighty speeds with their front legs in the air??? At any rate, what fabulo…
```

```
Very cool, thanks for the information. But what do you mean that they can manufacture the heat shock proteins “at will?” I doubt they’re sitting in a tunnel thinking “I’m planning to go outside, better rev up the old heat shock protein machine.” Maybe they’re generated by some pre-food gathering act…
```

```
I knew I'd heard about these little guys before, and tracked down the BBC clip about them, in the first few minutes of this one:

Thank you for reminding me of these amazing creatures!
```

```
“ I hope you enjoyed this answer”

I enjoy every answer you write. In fact I get a little thrill when I see you have posted a new one. And I don’t even like animals, and have no particular interest in them. Please keep them coming.
```

```
I didn’t know about these ants and thanks to you, I learned something today!
```

```
There’s definitely a strong case for describing these as an extremophile species.

Wonderfully informative answer, about an animal brand new to me!
```

```
Do the Saharan Nomads use Saharan ants to fix solar burns or burns in general? One would expect that these ants would be a rich source of heat shock proteins and that HSP would be useful in fixing heat damage.
```

```
*running* hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

got something!

*running* hot, hot, hot, hot, hot, hot

living in the desert, I fully understand and support this sentiment.
```

```
“Shock Proteins” are a fascinating concept! I have a question. If you wanted to go on a long hot walk in the sun, and since you said that shock proteins are “…an automated response to heat after the fact”, do you think it’s possible to strategically accumulate shock proteins before going on a walk?…
```

```
So, what can they harvest in the 10-minute window?
```

```
Thank you, this was an interesting read. But I have a question about the “ten minutes around midday” thing. Even where daily temperature changes are greatest, the change is slowest around the hottest (and coldest) times. I’d be surprised if all the ants’ predators stopped for only ten minutes each da…
```

```
Very nice! How big are ant neurons and how many do they have? And compared to the best nanoscale semiconductors, how big and how many synapses and axonal pathways and such in the ant nervous system? Could a relatively decent analogue of an entire ant brain and nervous system be fabricated on a small…

I wanted to share this of a magnified ant and what they look like! Why are they blue, are they blue and what's with the anteni coming out of the eyes? And do they have teeth? I think to myself wow, I'll never step on another because seeing them like this gives them a different place in my mind, they…
```

```
Thank you for your time for writing this.
```

```
Fabulously interesting. One wonders what they do for food in such an environment and surely with the shifting Saharan sands, maintaining their nests must be a bit of a challenge as well.
```

```
Ants are such extraordinary creatures. If we had none, and a writer made them up, nobody would believe it. And, I understand, that their biomass is the largest in the world. This makes the ant the #1 non-plant species on the planet.
```

```
Very interesting — thank you Gary!
```

```
Fun read! Thank you for sharing this.
```

```
Witness me!
(sorry…)

Those are pretty cool ants; at least they look a lot nicer than FL red ants that only seem to exist to short out electrical circuits…
```

```
There is a ton of crap floating around on Quora. But every once in a while, a nugget of gold pops up. Thanks for writing this!
```

```
Fascinating little critters. I love these answers
```

```
this is why I’m still on Quora
```

```
Oh god they have hair and run a meter a second?
```

```
I was so pleased to read this having originally been amazed by the David Attenborough documentary that featured these ants. In the same series also I learned that dung beetles navigate their way by the stars...is that true?
```

```
Yep, special. You open so much of the natural world to us. You’re awesome.
```

```
“Interesting, indeed! But do I have to take the aluminium foil wrap before eating the snacks?”
```

```
Fascinating! What do they eat?
```

```
I remember seeing these little guys on Plant Earth. Fascinating little guys. Despite their adaptations I’ve heard they still sometimes cook to death in the sun if they aren’t quick enough.
```

```
Very interesting! What kind of food do they find in the desert sand?
```

```
Holy shit! They're the original X-Men! 🤣😄🤣

Very good answer. Thank you for your time. 🤗💕
```

```
Thanks for posting this Gary. It proves there are amazing creatures every where if we only know to look for them!
```

```
Men: This why women take our houses. We fill our brains with useless information like this.

```
Mr. Rogers would have loved to have you tell that story to a young audience. What a fascinating peek into the wonderful world of creatures. Bravo.
```

```
You weren't kidding were you, this truly is fascinating, thanks for the post!
```

```
I can't disagree with you at all about ants in general. Truly one of the most fascinating and bad a** creatures nature has ever produced.
```

```
Some of those adaptations seen useful for spacecraft trying to explore near the Sun.
```

```
Very interesting, thank you 💐
```

```
Thank you for such an interesting and informative piece on amazingly adaptible fellow creatures (habitat -a hostile desert of all places) on our planet. I knew nothing about silver ants until I read your notes. Like other readers I too am intrigued about the fourlegged movement. I agree with you that…
```

```
Interesting. I recall reading that cockroaches also have a high-speed mode where the front end lifts off the ground. And some conjectures on the development of wings in early birds were that they were used to keep them on the ground while running so they were not dependent on body weight alone for tr…

```
This is what Quora about, sharing knowledge. Really interesting article and open my eyes about something I don’t know.
```

```
I’m going to read up on them. They would be neat to incorporate into a dungeons and dragons setting as a unique brand of thri-keen
```

```
How fascinating!

Thank you for this write-up.

One question. Does the 10 minute window get shortened during the colder months? Because it is bearable for the predatory birds, maybe?
```

```
Fascinating. I always learn something new from your answers and look forward to reading them. Thanks!
```

```
Wow.
```

```
Wow! Thank you for such an intriguing posting!
```

```
For how long can they maintain this speed of one meter per second?
```

```
I did enjoy your answer, thankyou.
```

```
Absolutely brilliant answer. Thank you for sharing about this fascinating creature!
```

```
It feels like I’m reading Nat geo! thank you for sharing something so fascinating!
```

```
Very interesting! They are surprisingly beautiful too! Thank you!
```

```
They’re beautiful and resourceful little buggers, aren’t they? I saw a documentary about them on BBC Earth. Impressive.
```

```
And they say aliens have never visited the earth.
```

```
This was an awesome read. Thank you!
```

```
Fascinating. Thank you!
```

```
Very interesting read. Of all the things in this post, the one that thoroughly boggled my mind the most is trying to picture an ant covering a meter in about one second 🤯 that is absurdly quick. All species of ants are endlessly fascinating, and I thank you for introducing me to this one!
```

```
Outstanding, interesting post 👍👏
```

```
Perhaps scientists could study these ants to create a heat shield for human use and habitation.
```

```
I have a question: Why are they not white? Wouldn‘t it be even more efffective for cooling down if they were just a bright, clean white color?
```

```
So very well written, as was your hummingbird treatise as well! Are you a professor? You are so knowledgeable and communicate in an engaging way.
```

```
Now this is interesting! Could they be considered an “extreamophile”? What other insects have evolved to thrive in adverse environments?
```

```
Wonderful!!! This makes my eyes get teary and a smile on my face at the wonder of our world. TY
```

```
Absolutely fascinating. Nature is just amazing.
```

```
Love ants, such an interesting group of animals.
```

```
Hello Gary; Fascinating, as always. In this 10 min window, give or take a few minutes, what do they eat?
```

```
Also, the record for this ant going one meter per second is that a human must travel at least 200 meters per second to be exposed to humans. Yes they are really fast
```

```
Very fascinating!!!!!
```

```
Fascinating! Thank you for sharing :)
```

```
Amazing
```

```
OK, but why only 10 min, is it just at dawn/dusk?
```

```
I feel like someone drybrushed these guys with some Vallejo Chainmail.
```

```
Great answer Gary, they are highly interesting creatures! Hopefully this is a constructive comment that addresses one of my biggest evolution bugbears — What do you say to my assertion that the Saharan heat hasn't “forced the ants to undergo extreme adaptation” but rather “Allowed only the plants and a…
```

```
Do they have the whole queens and colony set up too? I find it a bit hard to imagine they could move very far to set up a new colony if they get a new queen. Are they isolated from other colonies of their same species?
```

```
But what do they find on the desert to eat? And how do they know the food will be there for of to be worth the ten minutes?

Wow!

They are indeed fascinating.

What food do they find and collect in that short 10-minute window?
```

```
Ya know why these ants never get sick?

Cuz they have little Anty Bodies.
```

```
Adjunct question: been reading about the proposed Green Wall Of The Sahara (of trees) to be planted from coast to coast. Will this work? Will the Sahara’s southward-encroaching heat and drought stop at the treeline? Will the biosphere north of the treeline change in temperature and humidity at all?…

```
This is brilliant. Thanks so much. Question: how do we know that they produce these cells at will and that it’s not an automatic function?
```

I’ve always been fascinated by ants. Thank you for your answer.
```

```
If they’re so special, why do I want to kill them so much?
```

```
Wait! Not so fast! I kept waiting to read what they eat during these 10 minutes under the noonday sun? How can they eat and then gather enough food to bring back to the nest in such a short amount of time? What, noon is good but 1pm isn’t? Also, do they need water at all? Do they have defenses if po…

```
Wonderful creation, amazing design by the creator our God.
```

```
thank you…fascinating indeed!
```

```
Very interesting thanks and be safe and blessed always . Jesus cares say your prayers Amen
```

```
What is it they find to eat within that ten minute window?
```

```
This species along with the whole family of ants puts a slight dent in my profound belief in exclusively evolution. The wonders of “Hmm" nature will never cease.
```

```
But can you melt down the silver and sell it?
```

```
Weird little guys.
```

```
Very interesting in fact it gets me to pondering about the feasibility of using the prism effect in other applications of tempature control thanks for sharing you never know when info you have may be of use to someone else.
```

```
What do they eat!
```

```
George , where do you get all your unbelievably fascinating information?
