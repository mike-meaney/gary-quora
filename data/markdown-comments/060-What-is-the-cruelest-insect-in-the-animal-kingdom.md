There are some very nice answers to this questions already, but there‚Äôs a type of insect which I think deserves inclusion here too - the strepsipterans. Also known as the ‚Äútwisted-winged insects‚Äù, this is an order of parasites which is quite nasty to its hosts, and yet fascinating for so, so much more.

Let‚Äôs cover the basics. Strepsipterans are probably the weirdest of all the insect orders. Their eyes, for example, are really freaking weird. All insects have compound eyes, whereby each ‚Äúommatidium‚Äù forms a pixel, and together the thousands of ommatidia create a complete image. All insects‚Ä¶ except strepsipterans.

Instead, these guys have a few dozen ‚Äúeyelets‚Äù, and each one is a fully functioning eye that produces a complete image. In fact, this eye structure is more similar to that of the ancient trilobites than to any extant arthropod group. It makes their eyes look a lot like blackberries.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3d8f74cf303d8dc656e32b691ef6cf77-lq)

What‚Äôs most bizarre about this order, however, is the ridiculous sexual dimorphism. Males are only very weird; they‚Äôve got the trilobite eyes, and the adults don‚Äôt have mouths, as they only live for about five hours. Otherwise, they more or less resemble flies. Females, on the other hand, are downright absurd.

In the figure above, the photos labelled a and b are of adult females. They‚Äôre neotenic: they never metamorphose, instead remaining larval blobs for the rest of their lives. They don‚Äôt have wings, eyes, or legs.

But I‚Äôm getting distracted - this is the ‚Äúcruel‚Äù part of strepsipteran biology. The females are parasites of many types of arthropod, including grasshoppers, cockroaches and praying mantises. As little larvae, they invade their host through chinks in the exoskeleton, and will never leave. The insect below has several females parasitizing it.

The larvae grow and grow (but, as said, never metamorphose into adults), until they may constitute 90% of the volume of the host‚Äôs abdomen! As research in the 90s has shown, it‚Äôs likely that insects feel pain, and this must be an excruciating experience for the unfortunate victim of the females. If that wasn‚Äôt bad enough, they often castrate their hosts.

But the life cycle just gets weirder. The females begin to exude a scented pheromone which alerts males in the area as to their location. When a male finds one, he‚Äôll mate with her via hypodermic insemination. Basically, he stabs right through the host‚Äôs exoskeleton and into the female with a razor sharp reproductive organ - strepsipteran cruelty at work again.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-e5a25158d580f03876a028c7449bd1ec-lq)

The female‚Äôs eggs are fertilized, and later hatch. However, she does not lay them before they do so - instead, the babies emerge internally and just swim around her insides for a while. Eventually, they‚Äôll emerge through the wound from the male‚Äôs violent insemination, which is pretty damn metal. The female will later use up all her host‚Äôs available blood and starve to death, alone.

And so, the bizarre, fascinating and gruesome life of a female strepsipteran comes to a close. Like so many of the animals I‚Äôve written about in my answers, they‚Äôre highly underappreciated for their weirdness and uniqueness. Thanks for reading, and thanks for the A2A Sean.

Awesome answer!

The ‚ÄúIntelligent design‚Äù hypothesis casually destroyed in a single, short Quora answer. Nice!
```

```
This must be a hoax. There is no way given for the larvae to get into the host, without legs or wings. Other than that, it is a neat story.
```

```
You win, like a thousand times over!
```

```
A couple more interesting facts: 1.¬†Like flies and mosquitoes (Diptera), (male) strepsipterans have one pair of wings used for flying, and the other pair are reduced to halteres, which are used to sense the body‚Äôs orientation and motion in space. However, in Strepsiptera the flight wings are the hind wi‚Ä¶

I love your answers. They are so interesting and educational.
```

```
Now all that needs to happen is for the males to engage in ritual murder-penis duels like flat worms.
```

```
This sort of thing is the only argument I need against the standard versions of intelligent design. Either no creator exists‚Ä¶ or the creator is evil.
```

```
This is incredibly gross and yet simultaneously engrossing.
```

```
Fascinating thank you for putting this together
```

```
This is the most fascinating post I have read in a long time! Thank you for writing it!
```

What even is nature‚Ä¶
```

I guess I picked the wrong day to read Quora wile I was eating.
```

```
Why did I upvote my next nightmare? üò±
```

```
Yep, weird as hell.
```

```
I‚Äôll never see blackberries the same way again. Or grapes. Thank you for the awesome answer.
```

```
Great, now I have a new thing to think about at half 3 in the morning. Filed alongside Bott fly infestation. It might be nightmare fuel, but I'm always learning.
```

```
If they don‚Äôt have mouths, why do they have‚Ä¶ face-knives?

Also KILL, KILL IT WITH FIRE!

I have never heard of anything more deserving of the titles ‚ÄúBrutal‚Äù or ‚ÄúMetal‚Äù before in my entire life.
```

Cue nightmares
```

```
I am sorry I stopped reading after the eye pics. Truly craziest insect.
```

```
Very freaking interesting! It was so interesting that I read it twice!
```

```
The insect world is so fucking weird, fascinating, but seriously weird and fucked up.
```

```
Wait, what planet am I on now? This must be some outer space sh*t!
```

```
That is just fucked up‚Ä¶. Yet amazingly interesting‚Ä¶ Nature is full of cruel wonders isn't it???‚Ä¶

Intriguing answer. I won't sleep tonight but one must always take good with bad.
```

```
I love it! Super answer!
```

Yay, Gary!

I'd love to see how Disney handles this plot in the next edition of ‚ÄúA Bug's Life‚Äù

For some reason, this answer surprised me and almost made me puke :( I love Nature and her creations, but in this case, what was she thinking? Man!!!!
```

‚ÄúThe female will later use up all her host‚Äôs available blood and starve to death, alone.‚Äù Sounds like wish fulfillment for me when I was first considering the impact of child support and alimony. ‚ÄúIs it wrong to wish for her to starve to death alone after I'm bled dry?‚Äù (Note: I never missed a payment,‚Ä¶
```

I wonder if Orson Scott Card knew about this species before he came up with the piggies in Speaker for the dead. Their reproducing females were also larval and their babies destroyed them.
```

```
Their eyes look like blackberries!
```

```
Deeeeeeesgusting. Cleanse with flame. I would not cry if they were extinct.
```

```
How do baby-blobs find another host?
```

```
Interesting. However, what research has shown that insects feel pain??

I had read that insects can feel there is something wrong with their bodies‚Ä¶ they feel the malfunction‚Ä¶ but pain as we mammals feel, is something different‚Ä¶
```

```
A biology education can make us feel better about being human.
```

```
This seems like an extremely risky reproductive cycle. It‚Äôs a wonder they haven‚Äôt been selected for extinction.
```

```
how does an organism like this contribute to the ecosystem i wonder? if they were erradicated, what difference would it make? parasites like this seem to only have a negative impact on other organisms and thats it. i mean, does any organism benefit from their existance? as prey?
```

```
So how do the females spread from host to host?
```

```
How do the new larvae find new hosts?
```

```
How do the larvae go to a new host?

Cool answer!
```

```
I truly wish them all the best, but I also really, really, really hate all insects.
```

```
With no legs and no wings and no eyes‚Ä¶.how does the female get onto and select its victim / host?

When the female has the babies inside her‚Ä¶.ok so they get out of the dying insect through the hole but then how do they reach a new host?
```

```
I was just about to eat a snack, so thanks for grossing me out! Hey, that can be a tip for anyone wanting to lose weight - just look at something nasty and voila no appetite!
```

```
That's fascinating. The only thing that's missing is, how does the female disseminate her eggs.
```

```
How do the larva get to a new host?
```

```
It looks like an alien insect. They could make a horror movie with hordes of giant ones.
```

```
How do the females get to the insect then? Do they have wings early in life?
```

```
Take down the Strepsipteran patriarchy! Equal rights for females!
```

```
Nature never fails to fascinate (and disgust).
```

```
When the babies get out, how do the females spread to other insects if they do not transform?
```

```
Very weird indeed. I wonder how the creature learn the entire process. And how they didn‚Äôt go extinct since the male only lives for hours.
```

```
"Pretty damn metal" haha. Fascinating, never heard of this creature before. I wonder why it (males) evolved to have multiple full "eyes" rather than the low-res pixel versions? I'm following you now for sure
```

```
Hurts so good!
```

```
How long do the females usually live? If they find a host with enough blood do they have a much longer life or is it always pretty limited?
```

```
Truly and profoundly gross‚Ä¶ good job!
```

```
Yikes!!
```

```
Wow. Thank you.
```

```
Oh‚Ä¶..My‚Ä¶.Tidia !!!

what a great answer!
