I’ve written about a lot of super-obscure and seemingly drab animals before, but you could still be forgiven for assuming that I couldn’t think of a single remotely interesting type of mite. And you’d be right. I can think of five.

* * *

First, Adactylidium. If you thought its name was a mouthful, just wait for some of the creepy crawlies you’ll see coming up next! Biologists were initially perplexed when they studied the males of this species - after being born, they would not feed or mate, and die within hours. How could they possibly reproduce?

Believe it or not, their reproduction occurs before birth! Adactylidium females have one male offspring and at least five females in their “womb”. Inside his mother’s body, the male impregnates the unborn siblings, who then kill their mother from the inside out and crawl their way to the outside world, carrying young of their own.

So, their only purpose in life is to be incestuous and matricidal - a sad existence…

Next up, the South California mite. Relative to its size, this little arachnid is the fastest animal on the planet, by far. It’s less than a millimetre long, and dashes at speeds of around 0.8 km/h. That might not sound like much, but it means it can run 322 times its own body length in a single second! For comparison, a cheetah sprints at up to 16 body lengths per second.

If humans were that fast (proportionally), we could run at over 2,000 km per hour, nearly as fast as the top speeds of some fighter jets. Of course, small size is part of why the South California mite is so speedy - they have fewer cells than a large animal, and thus they produce less excess heat when moving at high velocity.

Thirdly, we have not just one species but a whole family of mites - the halarachnids. That being said there are only ten species in the family, which is tiny by arthropod standards. They are still super interesting though! Halarachnids are unique among mites in that they inhabit the oceans - but not in the way you’d think.

They live solely inside the nasal cavities of seals, sea lions, fur seals, walruses and otters, as parasites. In large numbers they can give the host severe respiratory ailments like pulmonary emphysema. And it gets worse - there has been one documented transmission to a human. He was sneezed on by a walrus while visiting SeaWorld!

Our next mighty mite is Macrocheles rettenmeyeri. Try saying that three times fast. This one is technically a parasite of army ants, but studies show that it may actually improve the life of its hosts. When it finds an ant, it will chew off one of the insect’s feet, and begin sucking its haemolymph (blood, basically).

That doesn’t sound very life-improving, does it? Well, Macrocheles latches on in place of the foot, and itself becomes a fully functioning foot. And research has suggested that the performance of the leg is improved with a mite-foot. So, this “parasite” is essentially a living, breathing prosthesis for ants.

Last, but certainly not least, we come to another catchy name - Osperalycus tenerphagus. You might expect that a creature as bizarre and wacky as this would be discovered in a remote jungle, but it was found on the grounds of Ohio State University, in 2014. The first thing you’d notice about it is its long, serpentine form - it’s built more like a worm than an arachnid.

Things get really weird, however, when you look closer. Its body is covered in rings, which in turn are marked by tiny paddle-like structures. Using muscle under its skin, it contracts these rings, then expands them using hydraulic pressure. This rhythm of contraction and expansion allows them to glide through sand and soil.

There are plenty of locomotive strategies animals use to get around, but this has to be one of the most alien.

So, these microscopic mites probably aren’t the most glamorous or charismatic animals I’ve ever written about, but I hope you too can see the novelty and curious beauty in the small and strange.

From super-speed and prenatal procreation to ant-amputating and a pintsize Shai-Hulud, there’s plenty of fascinating adaptations these crawlies have to offer. Thank you very much for reading! Have a great day.

Congratulations! You are the winner of this week’s coveted Phrase That Has Never Before Appeared in Print Award for “sneezed on by a walrus”.

And you are runner up in the Best Scenario For A New Series Of Nightmares Award for that same sentence. A rare double victory!
```

Zounds! Thanks for these mitey stories. I’ve told the Adactylidium story before, and I had heard (but you reminded me) of Macrocheles, but the others were new to me.
```

```
You always take us into marvelous worlds, Gary—from the microscopic to the massive!

And it is always enriching and delightful.
```

Maybe not glamorous or charismatic but utterly fascinating. Just when I think I’m close to seeing the maximum weirdness our planet can produce I find out how wrong I am. Now my question is why are science fiction aliens so utterly drab (little gray or green humanoids) when there are species like thes…

Fascinating. Thanks you. I thought my grandchildren were weird. Not even close.

This answer has had one view and 4 upvotes. If anyone deserves 400% upvote rates it’s Gary Meaney. Fabulous, fascinating, well-written answer as always.

Mini-monsters, and meanie monsters, too. Or, it’s just business; nothing personal. Gary, you should earn a hefty income from your writing, “monstruous” or not.
```

Great answer as always Gary! What is the fastest living thing by body lengths per second?

I want to know what was wrong with the 22 163 people who read this answer and didn’t upvote it.

Just discovered you recently on Quora and have been reading your posts like crazy. But now I am itching like crazy, not least because I live right outside of Columbus and many of my family work at Ohio State University.

As per usual, an assured upvote.

Bonus for the closing paragraph's Shai-Hulud Dune reference!

Your math doesn’t add up. If the South California mite is 1 mm and can move 13,5 m in an hour it moves 13500 mm/3600 s = 3,75 body lengths/second. It would need to be ≈ 0,01 mm to move at the speed you claim. Your middle school math/physics teacher is crying for your failure to detect that your answe…

I did my bachelor's degree project on a mite that we thought could be “used” to control biting flies. Machrocheles muscadomesticae. This practical project was one of the most interesting things I have ever done. Carried out in a building which housed leaf cutter ants and other species of interest. I…

Did I get this right: the Adactylidium has no means of mixing genes with other members of the species? How do they prevent degeneration? And it’s a very interesting question to think about how that kind of reproductive strategy evolved in the first place?
```

Great answer, again!!

My own would simply have been ‘Mar'…

…but I'm a lover not a hater…!!

(mmmm, on granary toast…)

Gary, I think you might make a brilliant sci-fi writer! You have all this amazing knowledge that would translate to creating fascinating off world and from world creatures!!
```

```
I'm sure you must have been asked this before, but have you written a book about your in depth knowledge of zoology ? I for one would buy and read it. I've only just recently read some of your articles and it inspired me to follow you. I can now read them all, and I look forward to the next. I thank…
```

```
Great.
```

```
I’ve always suspected that Adactylidium probably has more to its life cycle than we know about - it seems very unlikely to me that it exclusively practices sibling mating, and more likely they do at least occasionally exchange genes in some way within the population. Otherwise we need some way to ex…

Fascinating,and expertly written! I seldom read these types of answers,but yours was an exception.
```

```
Fascinating, thanks! Except that now I need to scratch all over.

Yet another fascinating insight into a world I didn’t know existed. Your knowledge is encyclopedic, Gary, and you write so as to make the subject very interesting. Thank you!
