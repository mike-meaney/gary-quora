In Africa, rhinoceroses are what’s called keystone species - they are crucial for the upholding of the ecosystem. Technically, all species are important ecologically, as the removal of one causes change, and for life - change is bad. However, a keystone species is one which stands out as playing a vital role.

White rhinoceroses

Grassland habitats are fundamentally lacking in nutrients, at least in the soil. That’s one of the reasons why they don’t subside to forest. Some animals, like wildebeest, eat the long, nutrient-poor grass and rely on their powerful digestive systems to process the vegetation.

In contrast, other animals like gazelles eat “sweet grass”, the most nutrient-rich of savannah grasses. In order for any viable concentration of sweet grass to exist in a certain place, there must be a reasonably dense nutrient content in the soil. One of the prime factors which recycles broken-down nutrients into the ground is dung - however, there is usually not enough of it in one place.

White rhino midden

However, rhinos are known for defecating in middens - preset sites where all dung is deposited. These exist for the purpose of being regular, fixed stations where other rhinos can gather information about their peers, but also have the consequence of putting a lot of nutrients into the soil in one place - perfect for sweet grass.

This habit of creating middens is something not seen in black rhinos, which are the less endangered of Africa’s two rhinoceros species. Rhinos are as important to the African savannah ecosystem as any animal, more so in fact, and are - additionally - great for the economy by drawing in tourists, and fundamentally deserve the right to live in the first place.

I love rhinos…. Beautiful animals!

Irrespective of their germaneness, every living being whether plant or animal, unicellular or multicellular, pathogenic or beneficial, has an equal right to this planet, and human beings are not the sole proprietors of the planet Earth. Any organism that thinks so brings about its destruction direct…

What a marvelous answer. Thank you.

I love my keystone species - thanks for letting me know why WHITE rhinos provide a vital service that black rhinos do not.

Thanks for sharing it's worth reading

So technically, Animals are terraformers.

That’s awesome.

Great post Gary. In my experience, though, black rhinos most certainly do use middens, though perhaps you're speaking about a specific area or region? Would you please enlighten? Also, as others noted, there are several times more white rhinos than black. That one is a bit more of an objective fact.…

The critical nature of keystone species was made clear by the return of wolves to Yellowstone and the resultant shift of the ecology to benefit just about every species in the park.

We should import them to USA, Texas particularly would have a lot to offer. Florida could participate too, they already have a habitat good for hypos too. Crocodiles and monkeys are already there, they would feel at home and accepted fast.
```

There are FAR more white rhinos than black rhinos. The black rhino is critically endangered.
```

Serious question. Rhinos may once have been a keystone species. But given their now very small numbers. Surely they no longer have any significant role as such. While there may well be advantages in restoring their former populations. At this point, surely their extinction would make little difference…

Humans are supposedly an intelligent species, and therefore, we should know not to affect other species making them extinct. But I used the word intelligent, which should become extinct. Its application is becoming unintelligible, obscure and limited to few in a population. I have no problem in acce…

“black rhinos, which are the less endangered of Africa’s two rhinoceros species.” Incorrect, there are a few times more white rhinos than black rhinos.

Well the multi billion dollar question now is what do we do about all this? What is the solution since every pathogen,insect,pest and disease causing viruses are important to the ecosystem? How the help do we coexist because it seems to me humans have actually taken over the earth because 95% of ever…

Holy crap! I’m Kenyan and I never KNEW this. Thanks for the info. You truly do learn something new everyday.

I wouldn’t write off a species so fast, for YOUR life may depend on theirs.

I fear for the life of every existing rhino and elephant wandering free. Greed is a hard demon to kill

Are they also natural firefighters, or was that a movie invention?

What is so diabolically sad & cruel about the rhino’s endangered status & most likely extinction, is because some culture has decided that the horn is a cure for their lack of virility. It is not for meat, or hunger or even just skin & or fashion. Just a backward, stupid & arrogant want of a culture…

Gary, would you mind mentioning the Asian rhinos? I don’t want them to be forgotten, and I worry so much about them

an earthworm is as important as a human being. do not judge or evaluate. you do not know what you do not know.

There is one animal that could go extinct and by so doing, would be beneficial to the environment of the planet - and that animal is homo sapiens.

“fundamentally deserve the right to live in the first place”

You lost them there with that last part.

“Technically, all species are important ecologically”

Technically not true.

Body louse - Wikipedia
This article is about the animal. For the infestation caused by body lice, see Pediculosis corporis . The body louse ( Pediculus humanus humanus , also known as Pediculus humanus corporis ) is a hematophagic ectoparasite louse that infests humans. It is one of three lice which infest humans, the other two being the head louse , and the crab louse or pubic louse . Despite the name, body lice do not directly live on the host. They lay their eggs on fibres of clothing and only come into contact with the host whenever they need to feed. Since body lice cannot jump or fly, they spread by direct contact with another person or more rarely by contact with clothing or bed sheets that are infested. Body lice are disease vectors and can transmit pathogens that cause human diseases such as epidemic typhus , trench fever , and relapsing fever . In developed countries, infestations are only a problem in areas of poverty where there is poor body hygiene, crowded living conditions, and a lack of access to clean clothing. [1] Outbreaks can also occur in situations where large groups of people are forced to live in unsanitary conditions. These types of outbreaks are seen globally in prisons, homeless populations, refugees of war, or when natural disasters occur and proper sanitation is not available. Life cycle and morphology Edit Pediculus humanus humanus (the body louse) is indistinguishable in appearance from Pediculus humanus capitis (the head louse ), and the two subspecies will interbreed under laboratory conditions. In their natural state, however, they occupy different habitats and do not usually meet. They can feed up to five times a day and as adults can live for about thirty days, but if they are separated from their host they will die within a week. If the conditions are favorable, the body louse can reproduce rapidly. After the final molt, female and male lice will mate immediately. A female louse can lay up to 200–300 eggs during her lifetime. The life cycle of the body louse consists of three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Eggs (also called nits, see head louse nits ) are attached to the clothes by the female louse, using a secretion of the accessory glands that holds the egg in place until it hatches, while the nits (empty egg shells) may remain for months on the clothing. They are oval and usually yellow to white in color and at optimal temperature and humidity, the new lice will hatch from the egg within 6 to 9 days after being laid. [2] A nymph is an immature louse that hatches from the egg. Immediately after hatching it starts feeding on the host's blood and then returns to the clothing until the next blood-meal. The nymph will molt three times before the adult louse emerges. The nymph usually takes 9–12 days to develop into an adult louse. [2] The adult body louse is about 2.5–3.5 mm long, and like a nymph it has six legs. It is wingless and is tan to grayish-white in color. Life cycle of Pediculus humanus capitis, which is similar to the bod

Crab louse - Wikipedia
This article is about the animal. For the infestation by crab or pubic lice see, see Phthiriasis pubis . The crab louse or pubic louse ( Pthirus pubis ) is an insect that is an obligate ectoparasite of humans , feeding exclusively on blood . [1] The crab louse usually is found in the person's pubic hair . Although the louse cannot jump, it can also live in other areas of the body that are covered with coarse hair, such as the perianal area , in men practically the entire body, and in children the eyelashes . [2] [3] Humans are the only known hosts of the crab louse, although a closely related species, Pthirus gorillae , infects gorillas . The human parasite diverged from Pthirus gorillae approximately 3.3 million years ago. [4] It is more distantly related to the genus Pediculus , which contains the human head and body lice and lice that affect chimpanzees and bonobos . The infestation (phthiriasis), like the name of the order to which the louse belongs (Phthiraptera), is spelled with phth , but the scientific name of the louse, Pthirus pubis , is spelled with pth , despite this being based on a misspelling that was nevertheless fixed as the official spelling in 1958. [5] Infestation of the eyelashes is referred to as pediculosis ciliaris or phthiriasis palpebrarum. [8] The main symptom of infestation with crab lice is itching , usually in the pubic-hair area, resulting from hypersensitivity to louse saliva, which can become stronger over two or more weeks following initial infestation. In some infestations, a characteristic grey-blue or slate coloration appears ( maculae caeruleae ) at the feeding site, which may last for several days. [ citation needed ] Crab louse egg on human body hair Current worldwide prevalence has been estimated at 2% of the human population, but accurate numbers are difficult to gauge because crab louse infestations are not considered a reportable condition by many health authorities, and many cases are self-treated or treated discreetly by physicians. [9] It has been suggested that an increasing percentage of humans removing their pubic hair , especially in women, has led to reduced crab louse populations in some parts of the world. [10] [11] Crab lice are not known to transmit disease. In infested individuals an average of a dozen lice can be found. Although they are typically found attached to hair in the pubic area, sometimes they are also found on coarse hair elsewhere on the body (for example, eyebrows , eyelashes , beard , moustache , chest , armpits , etc.). They do not generally occur on the finer hair of the scalp. [6] [12] Crab lice attach to pubic hair that is thicker than other body hair because their claws are adapted to the specific diameter of pubic hair and other thick hairs of the body. [13] Crab louse infestations ( pthiriasis ) are usually spread through sexual contact and are most common in adults. [13] [2] [3] The crab louse can travel up to 25 cm (10 in) on the body.

Neither species even interact with any species except humans to a meaningful degree.
