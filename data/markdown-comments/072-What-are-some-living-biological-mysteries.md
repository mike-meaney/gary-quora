One of zoology‚Äôs greatest unsolved mysteries surrounds the obscure facetotectans. They are a subset of crustaceans, and have been found in all the world‚Äôs oceans, from the Arctic to the tropics. Eleven different species are known thus far, but it‚Äôs likely if not certain that more remain undiscovered.

We‚Äôve been finding them since 1887 - well, that is, we‚Äôve been finding their larvae. To this day, nobody has seen an adult facetotectan. We don‚Äôt know what they turn into when they grow up. So far, we have identified two larval stages in the wild. The first stage is known as the nauplius, and looks like this:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-408864e956bf084d8d50e34fc74fc845-pjlq)

Nauplii have a rounded shield covering their head, and a stubby tail. They can be as little as 0.025 cm in length. Each nauplius actually goes through five separate slightly different forms, called instars, before metamorphosing into its second stage of development: the cyprid.

Cyprids are a bit larger, and a little more recognizable as crustaceans, with a functioning pair of eyes and a long, segmented body. Those little appendages that look like legs are actually its gills, although they can be used for walking. The cyprid form can also secrete some kind of adhesive substance.

We have made one breakthrough towards figuring out what grown-up facetotectans look like. In 2008, a team of researchers injected cyprids with a growth hormone called 20-hydroxyecdysone. This stimulated them to shed their exoskeletons and progress to a new phase of life. The results were‚Ä¶ bizarre, to say the least.

This new form was not an adult, but some kind of juvenile stage which they dubbed the ypsigon. Its eyes and muscles had all but worn away, and had neither limbs nor segmentation - it was little more than a microscopic slug. Similar to earthworms, ypsigons move via peristalsis - contracting and relaxing in a rhythmic, wave-like motion.

The discovery of this form was a tantalizing step towards solving this mystery. Perhaps adult facetotectans have eluded us by being parasites, living hidden inside larger organisms. If this is the case, it would be one of several curious similarities between this group and another outlandish type of crustacean‚Ä¶

If you‚Äôre familiar with some of [my older answers](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-oddest-lifeform-ever-discovered/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"), you may recall the rhizocephalan barnacles - in my opinion, the strangest animals on the planet. They too start out life as primitive nauplii, before morphing into squishy degenerate forms and parasitizing other animals. Facetotectans are indeed very closely related to barnacles, so they may have more in common with rhizocephalans than we thought.

It may be a long time before we discover the true identity of these creatures, but I have a feeling that whatever they turn out to be will be unexpected. Thank you for reading, have a great day.

I‚Äôm going to display my ignorance of zoology here ‚Äî why isn‚Äôt it as easy as getting some larvae in an aquarium and seeing them grow?
```

```
Very cool information! I had never even heard of this group, although my specialty is protozoan members of the plankton. It seems likely, given the relatively degenerate form of the ypsigon, that the trigger for metamorphosis is contact with the actual host species. The ypsigon probably moves to a sp‚Ä¶

Really interesting!

I suggest putting something about their size earlier in the answer‚Ä¶I didn‚Äôt realize they were microscopic until 3/4 the way through.

Parasites always fascinate me. How they cycle from host to host, how they deviously infect their unsuspecting hosts, how they manage to evade their host's immune system, etc.
```

```
This is utterly fascinating. If we could come up with some sort of miniature tracking system we could see what happens to them. However, something that small would be almost impossible.
```

```
Great stuff! Thanks so much for a little education.
```

```
No.

The truth has been under our noses the whole time.

Those are baby pigeons.

Think about it. Have you EVER actually seen a pigeon egg? nest? chick?

Problem solved.
```

```
Mermaids. They turn into Mermaids. You know how we've never seen a baby mermaid‚Ä¶
```

```
Perhaps the adult form is Linguafoeda acheronsis and we have been wrong about its juvenile stages!
```

```
Any attempt at progress will probably earn an Ignoble Award. Sigh. I‚Äôd love to know the host identity of even one of these, and the adult (or whatever next) form, but it will take true creative genius to pry money from funding agencies for the research.
```

```
I love learning about new animals all the time! I‚Äôve learned so much and I‚Äôve also managed to figure out how much I do actually know. Thank you for all the cool information!
```

```
Amazing.
```

```
How do they know that what has been observed are merely larval stages and not the adult form? Lack of reproductive organs?
```

```
What joy to be an observer of such a brilliant bunch of contributors to my knowledge! Thanks
```

```
Thank you. Fascinating!
```

```
There‚Äôs no mystery here, they are facehuggers! Haven‚Äôt you ever seen Alien? It‚Äôs even implied in their name - facetotectan = faceo‚Äôhuggin‚Äôtectan.
```

```
Damn It Gary , another great answer . But perplexing . I need to know more now .

thank you for firing up my curiosity üëçüèº
```

```
Why are we confident they even have a final form? Do we know for sure they can‚Äôt reproduce at the current stage of the development we see them at? And why is it so hard to figure out? Are they impossible to keep in captivaty, or do they simply refuse to metamorphisze when place in an aquarium?
```

```
Has anybody tried to keep and fed the larvae in captivity to see how they mature?
```

```
Who says they have an adult form? There are neotenic species that complete the life cycle without reaching ‚Äúadult‚Äù.

These could too.
```

```
Why do they have to change to ‚Äúadult‚Äù?

Many animals retain juvenile appearance. It is called ‚Äúneoteny‚Äù
```

```
Here‚Äôs some more ignorance: How do you know that they have more stages? Isn‚Äôt also possible that we simply don‚Äôt know how they reproduce, but that they do so in the stage that we currently know them to mature to?
```

```
Another fine example of how little science actually has managed to catalog of nature‚Äôs almost miraculous bounty.
```

```
Given they need specific environmental triggers to change stages, it wouldn‚Äôt be outside the realm of possibilities that they can grow into different looking animals by design when they grow up, depending on the environment. Would that be a first in the animal kingdom?
```

```
Are we talking about the shield shrimps here Gary? I know that these are fresh and salt water beasties. They remind me of the trilobites, which of course they are not‚Ä¶
```

```
So they die when kept in an aquarium / terrarium? Otherwise, it should be pretty doable to know how the adults look‚Ä¶
```

```
They look so much like barnacle nauplii & cyprids - What characteristics differentiate them from rhizocephalan barnacles?
```

```
I‚Äôm wondering if there are critters whose adult form is known but not the larval, and they might be the same creature as the one with the unknown adult?
```

```
You‚Äôve probably considered and dismissed the idea for good reason, but is it possible that these larva reproduce in their larval form like axolotls?
```

```
Just curious, is there no way to extract their DNA and compare w known marine samples?‚Ä¶
```

```
I think that‚Äôs what I have groiwng between my toes! [ Very cool! ]
```

```
I appreciate these kind of answers that add value to your knowledge. Far more interesting and Informative than those written by some of the famous Quorans.
```

```
We should ask Mitch McConnell. He gave birth to all parasites
```

```
Humans had no business creating ypsigons.
```

```
Crustacean endoparasites are quite rare, aren't they?

Why aren't these facetotectans regarded as neotenous?
```

```
Fascinating as always. Thank you.
```

```
Maybe they aren‚Äôt juveniles but just asexually reproducing adults?
