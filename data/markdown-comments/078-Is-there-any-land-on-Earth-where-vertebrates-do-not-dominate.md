## An Island Ruled by Killer Centipedes

One would think that, with vertebrates having ruled the world‚Äôs terrestrial ecosystems for hundreds of millions of years, it would be impossible for such a place to exist on the modern Earth. Surprisingly, one would be wrong. There is one spot which is so small and remote that no predatory land vertebrate of decent size has managed to colonize it - but something else has.

The location I speak of is Phillip Island.

It lies off Norfolk Island, a distant Australian territory, in the stretch of the Pacific sandwiched between New Zealand and [New Caledonia.](https://www.quora.com/Which-island-has-the-most-unusual-plant-life/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com") It‚Äôs pretty tiny, stretching a couple kilometres from end to end, and pretty barren, with no real human settlement. The scenery on Phillip Island is hauntingly beautiful, a fact it owes to its volcanic cliffs and bright red earth.

In terms of wildlife, there‚Äôs not an awful lot going on, to say the least. The island is home to two species of lizard, and about a dozen types of seabird roost on its cliffs. All of these animals are at risk of falling victim to the formidable apex predator of the landmass: the Phillip Island centipede.

With a nasty pair of mandibles and an extremely venomous bite, this arthropod has become a specialist hunter of vertebrates - fish, skinks, geckos, birds‚Ä¶ in other words, anything and everything which crawls, swims or flies on its island. Often, it slays animals many times larger than itself, though that‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs small - it measures more than 23 centimetres, or 9 inches, in length!

In particular, the centipede is partial to chicks of the black-winged petrel, Phillip Island‚Äôs most ubiquitous seabird. Despite outweighing their predator by far, the chicks are defenseless while holed up in their burrows, and are typically eaten alive. Every year, nearly 4,000 birds fall prey to centipedes. This is not a concern for conservationists, however, as natural predation is all part of the balance of the ecosystem.

As said, they don‚Äôt just eat seabirds - the two native species of lizard are frequent prey too. Here‚Äôs a great photo of a centipede chowing down on a G√ºnther island gecko.

Remarkably, this incredible carnivore was only described in 1984. At the time, Phillip Island centipedes were exceptionally rare, as the intrusion of foreign mammals like rabbits, pigs and goats had caused massive ecological disruption on the island. In fact, they gave the place its signature ochre hues, by destroying the vegetation that was holding the topsoil together. As you can see, erosion ensued.

Thankfully, these invasive species have since been eradicated, and Phillip Island is healing. Plant cover is returning, so lizards and birds are returning, so the centipedes are returning. Given that we‚Äôve only formally known about these creatures for 37 years, I suspect that we still have much to learn about their biology and habits. I eagerly await any breakthroughs or discoveries.

In a world where it can seem like mammals dominate the planet, it‚Äôs nice to know that there‚Äôs a remote island out there somewhere where a giant bird-eating centipede rules the roost.

Well folks, this one was a little on the short side, mainly due to the fact that there just isn‚Äôt that much we know about the Phillip Island centipede‚Ä¶ for now. Regardless, I hope you enjoyed the answer. Have a great day.

I actually started reading this answer before I saw who the author was, and yet not even halfway through I thought ‚Äúthe only Quoran who writes about obscure critters like the Phillip Island centipede with this combination of depth, loving enthusiasm and quirky humor is Gary Meaney‚Äù. Lo and behold, i‚Ä¶

A great answer and trully beautiful photos you shared. Attention dear fellow readers of this answer: There‚Äôs two Philip Islands when one wants to know more. The one is the small island you described, it‚Äôs to be found here on a Google Maps search: Phillip Island ¬∑ Victoria, Australia. The other is near M‚Ä¶
```

The one thing I‚Äôm glad of is that those centipedes are stuck on that island, and are nowhere near where I live.
```

This is a wonderful post, and winner of today‚Äôs ‚ÄúEEEWWwhatthefuck!‚Äù prize. :-)

If there is any sequence of words I never wanted to see put together, ‚Äúgiant bird-eating centipede‚Äù are they.

Oh well, at least it‚Äôs not Arthropleura. Two metres long. Also venomous. Yikes!
```

```
What a horrible, horrible creature! I really love those birds though. You really knocked it out of the park again! Have you been? I could almost have been there and in light of its most populous creature, I‚Äôm almost glad I haven‚Äôt visited! I‚Äôm joking around. I‚Äôd love to visit that little island. Eve‚Ä¶

That‚Äôs really freaky how he‚Äôs eating the lizard.
```

```
What a great story! I am a friend to all living things, but good lord do large centipedes test my resolve. That Attenborough clip about the one in Venezuela that eats bats is a hair raiser.
```

```
Thank you Gary. No, your answer isn't short, it‚Äôs a good length for an answer, actually. And great pictures too.
```

```
Great and enjoyable post Gary. I have learned something new again. Thank you!
```

```
Love the first pic showing the land recovering.
So, you started the story on a hopeful note.
Thanks, Gary!

Now I know where hell is. I am South African and lived on a game farm with only a fence between me and the big 5. I like spiders, think scorpions are quite cute and respect snakes. The one thing that scares the living hell out of me is centipedes. Very interesting post but please keep the crawlies t‚Ä¶
```

Beautifully done, Gary. It's always a pleasure to find one of your answers in my feed.
```

```
Centipedes do not have a venomous bite. Their first pair of legs have venom which they can inject into prey, predators or etc.
```

```
Thanks Gary. This is amazing information and such great photos. Are these centipedes also found on Norfolk Island ? I never heard about them when l was there, so assume they aren‚Äôt a problem on Norfolk. But it‚Äôs only about 5 kms between the two islands. BTW. There is a fishing club shack on Phillip Is‚Ä¶
```

```
Shudder‚Ä¶ everything with more than four legs‚Ä¶. Everything with more than six? Ack!. That thing is a monster that goes bump in the night.
```

```
Thank you again for an amazing post! Informative, even though shorter than usual.
```

```
That centipede just switched to gecko.
```

```
Makes my skin crawl.
```

```
Fascinating. I learned something.
```

```
welp, cross THAT location off my bucket list. Not going there.
```

```
Thank you for your enthusiastic and informative answer, although this time it is somewhat nightmare fuelling!
```

```
I always enjoy your answers.
```

```
Nice job üëç like the style
```

```
I for one welcome our new centipede overlords! :D
```

```
Gary Meaney you are my favourite Quoran. Another wonderful and informative answer. I didn't know about this island and it's inhabitants until now. Thank you.
```

The Phillip Island I know of is not far from Melbourne.
Is there another one?

I‚Äôd be surprised if the bird chick was actually much heavier than the centipede, much less by more than a few grams. Birds have hollow bones and are very light. A quick Google search puts certain storm petrel hatchlings at as light as 10 grams. Compare that to a 71 g Giant Weta or 28 g Atlas moth, a‚Ä¶

How were the invasive species eradicated, especially rabbbits who have been about impossible to remove elsewhere? Mice and rats would be even worse.
