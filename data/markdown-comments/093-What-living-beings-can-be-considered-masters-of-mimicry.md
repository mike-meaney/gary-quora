In my opinion, the most amazing species of mimic is not an animal at all; it’s a rather boring-looking species of plant called Boquila trifoliolata - nicknamed the “chameleon vine”, and for good reason.

Believe it or not, all the above leaves are from the same species of plant. Boquila’s mind-blowing ability is that its leaves change shape to mimic those of the nearest trees. Somehow, their size, shape, stalk and colour morph to blend in with nearby tree leaves, disguising themselves from animals which might eat them.

They can even grow spiny tips on the leaves should the host plant have such spines, and can mimic different types of foliage on the same individual plant. On any one Boquila trifoliolata plant, some leaves might be 10 times the size of others.

But this of course begs the question - how on Earth does it “know” which leaves to mimic? It can’t be by touch, because it doesn’t even require physical contact to mimic. There are currently two hypotheses:

1.  The vine can detect compounds emanating from the local plants, recognizes them, and then uses hormones and signals to change the genetic makeup of the leaves in the area. Of course, this would mean that it must have an internal “database”, if you will, of dozens of local tree species.
2.  An even wilder idea - the chameleon vine is in fact receiving genes from the nearby trees. Horizontal gene transfer is when organisms pass on DNA, but not via producing offspring - it would be like you taking some random person’s genes and using them to look like him.

I think I’d put my money on the first hypothesis, as it seems more grounded. I fail to imagine how horizontal gene transfer could occur between two plants if they weren’t in contact. In any case, it still remains a mystery to this day.

Boquila trifoliolata is one of my favourite species of plant, and I hope you’ve enjoyed learning about it in this answer. Thanks for reading.

Wow! I thought that I had learned about every remarkable plant and animal by now but that’s phenomenal. There must be some advantage to mimicking other plants. The only plausible one I can think of is that the plant is unusually palatable to some animal and therefore needs to become less visible, muc…

One thing you notice as a botanist is that a lot of features of the Angiosperms (woody vs. non-woody, thin deciduous leaves vs. thick evergreen leaves, lobed vs. entire leaf margins, spines vs. smooth leaf margins, etc.) crop up again and again in different plant families. It’s as if a great many pl…

This is unbelievable! I had to spend 10 minutes reading about Boquila from other sources just to convince myself that you didn't just make this up (and post pictures of normal plants when random arrows drawn in them)
```

```
I've studied about those plants in situ. As far as I'm concerned there isn't yet specific research, but what botanist think here on Chile (and at my university), is that those plants use some sort of light sensitive cells to perceive the shape of neighbouring plants and then mimic those forms. Here…

This is truely mind blowing! And the first point certainly looks more convincing as how it happens. Adding to that, it may be possible thatplants may be having an epigenetic code to determine leaf shape and which may be influenced by external factors, hormones etc. If so, it would be interesting to…
```

```
That is… uncanny.

Thank you for your answer @Gary Meaney. I love reading your answers. Yes it is an amazing plant that baffled me when i first read about it. And it continues to baffle me :) It must be a coincidence that i mentioned this very plant in my answer: Aditya Garg (आदित्य गर्ग)'s answer to What non-venomous a…

Just when you think you’ve heard it all…as a frequent visitor to Borneo’s rainforests I expected the answers to the question to mention the usual suspects such as Horned Frogs (Megophrys sp.), Walking Leaves (Phyllidae), birdshit spiders, and the like. I’ve seen them all and used to consider them wo…
```

```
Woah! That really blew my mind.
```

```
Wonderful. But don’t these plants have an identity crisis, requiring lots of plant therapy?
```

```
Gary, thank you. This is absolutey fascinating.
```

```
Wow… Made my day
```

My guess, with zero research, is that the mimicry does not involve any communication with other plants at all. There must be a parasite that strongly prefers to eat the leaves of that vine. Furthermore, this parasite visually searches for leaves to eat. The vine is doing A/B testing to see which leaf…
```

The vine's roots could touch and invade its neighbor's roots, so as to to pick up the neighbor's genes.
```

```
“ I fail to imagine how horizontal gene transfer could occur between two plants if they weren’t in contact.”

Their roots are in contact? *shrug*
```

```
Whoa! Gary! I don’t remember hearing about the Boquila, or if I did, it didn’t register. Thanks for the info. It seems to me that all the possible explanations are equally far out. The thing that’s most clearly indicated is that there’s a whole lot about plants we don’t know. Maybe more than what we…
```

```
I was wondering if it might be from light - the shadows of the nearby plant leaves could cause the leaf to adopt similar shapes…

still speculation though.
```

```
The gene transfer could be mediated by a fungus that's mycorrhizal with both the vine and local trees, or by a microorganism that infects both. That would allow there to be no direct physical contact.
```

Plants are also completely destroying our idea of fear, emotions, memory and nervous system. It does seem like plants are doing things and feeling things. Yet they are doing it in a direct way. Electrical potentials, and firing, like in neurones, can be measured in plants too. Mimosa podia can even…
```

```
Amazing. If the plant mimics it’s neighbours, how far does this go? Does it produce the same flower/fruit that the mimicked plant does, and if not, I wonder why not, as it seems to be using the same genes to alter it’s leaves.
```

```
How would that internal database ever be *build*? Option 2, nicking part of your neighbour’s blueprints, seems more likely to me, but even so: Mind. Blown.
```

```
It does not seem to be too difficult to test both these hypotheses by growing the plant next to trees that are absent in its native range and are not closely related to native species. If it can also mimick those trees, it apparently does not rely on a “database” of tree species.
```

```
This is certainly a fascinating behaviour, Gary. I agree with you that the second scenario you mention can almost certainly be discounted. Also that the leaf morphology variations must be attributed to chemical signalling. That is really the only remaining option. But in then ascribing the mechanism to…
```

```
Hmm, bith these hypothesises (when to stop spelling?) seem based on the idea that there is a chsnge in the genes of the leaves. But would it not also be plausible (more, even) tp think that the plant has developed a trick to grow its leaves at different speeds and shapes?
```

```
I would have thought method 2 is more likely. Looking at method 1:- * The only place the “database” posited in 1 could be stored would be the DNA otherwise each generation would have to rebuild the database. * There would have to be a detection and building stage before mimicry, how is that achieved. * How wo…
```

Well, trees can communicate through root systems and maybe, in this case, this is what's happening.

(Extension to my previous Android alter ego remarks). This is certainly a fascinating behaviour, Gary. I agree with you that the second scenario you mention can almost certainly be discounted. Also that the leaf morphology variations must be attributed to chemical signalling. That is really the only re…
```

```
Could the roots be in contact?
```

```
Maybe those plants use the tree pollen (hormones) to blend in with the trees. Tree pollen falls from the trees all over the surroundings. People with pollen allergies know this!
```

```
Perhaps it has eyes.
