Flatfish! Chances are you’ve eaten one before. We tend to ignore them, take them for granted. They are so commonplace in our lives that it’s hard to see how bizarre they really are.

First of all, you have their defining characteristic - the fact that both of their eyes are on the same side of their head. The fact that they managed to gradually evolve this setup over millions of years is mind-blowing in itself.

To see how this fish “should” look, you have to turn your head sideways. From an anatomical perspective, that’s not the fish’s back you’re seeing, it’s its flank. Before anybody comments that this “could not have evolved”, I’ll add that this transition is well-understood and supported by both fossil and ontogenetic evidence.

Back to square one, lads.

Now, what’s interesting is that all flatfish are born symmetrical, like other fish. That’s not to say the larvae are boring - in fact, they too are often ridiculously bizarre:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9704a2ed1c7eab13bf632d5f46616c02-lq)

To make matters more confusing, there is one species which breaks the status quo and has one eye on the top of its head. This is the rather gruesome-looking Greenland halibut, which has reversed its evolutionary history somewhat to attain better peripheral vision:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-77e9332fad18f68a9481550cff462ce3-pjlq)

This also gives it the appearance of having one eye when it’s lying on its side.

For the more conforming species, however, both eyes will either be on the left or the right side. Well… if you’ve been paying attention, it might not surprise you very much that it’s even more complicated than this, because in one family - the spiny turbots:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-712fab16100d438ddf85309c98bad302-pjlq)

Individuals of the same species may be “left-eyed” or “right-eyed”! Furthermore, in a given species of spiny turbot, the ratio between the two types is usually around 1:1. In the natural world, there is always an exception - or, more often, four or five different exceptions - to the rule.

And, believe me, it gets weirder. For example, did you know that many flatfishes can change colour to camouflage, like chameleons?

The below photos are all of the same fish, taken in a very short space of time:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d52f90451072fb9389d1428384e68265-lq)

This one can even camouflage against a goddamn checkerboard:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c6be95d323c0377aa9db08e75bd03dc1-pjlq)

They do this in the same way which cephalopods change colour, with specially adapted chromatophores - these cells-turned-organs are essentially little balloons containing many granules of pigmentation, which can be inflated or deflated at will.

This poor guy damaged his eyesight, and thus cannot adapt his coloration to the environment effectively:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-44904bee5d8516279e6eac99b966dbdf-pjlq)

In addition to all this, some species here and there have more weird features and adaptations. Some have their eyes mounted on rotating “turrets”, so that they can swivel around independently of one another.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-beb0e75d442f3f48b51e9094f9879293-lq)

Others have eyes which are spaced really widely apart:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-89d1188136708f7b46ca2608e6bc6a08-lq)

And then there’s one - the leopard flounder - which has these strange stalks trailing from the back of its eye stumps, which are used for territorial and courtship display.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7e00672ca9db944dd0dec75631addf54-lq)

And then there’s another one - Asterorhombus intermedius - which has a little wiggly lure sticking out of its mouth to attract smaller fish into its maw.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-28cb39e3a4dea119c14a29933c10e6b8-lq)

If you look closely, you can see that the lure is in fact part of its dorsal fin (bottom left), and would once have been one of the fin rays.

Surely that’s it. Surely these guys couldn’t get any weirder…

Wrong again! We’ve got huge-mouthed flatfish!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-aa6d098433c5cf98b6b729bfddadde00-lq)

Flatfishes with fans of neon-blue spines!

Amorphous blobby flatfish!

Biofluorescent flatfish which glow orange-red under UV light!

Flatfish that mimic toxic turbellarian worms!

Um… this thing!

You’ve got to be kidding me…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b507d6a8e6c56345ffdc70477a1da974-lq)

What even are flatfish?

I think you get my point. Flatfish are incredibly weird and cool. Showing that was the… sole purpose of my answer.

This is grossly under-upvoted. I mean, the pun and big reveal at the end. I didn’t know we were looking at soles the whole time.
Plus all those pretty pics. c’mon.

> Showing that was the … sole purpose of my answer. You're a Dab hand at writing engaging Quora answers. This one was just Brill!

Always fascinating. You should be getting 20,000 upvotes.

Flatfish are freaking awesome. I once saw a group of baby flatfish while wading in the Baltic sea. They were about the size and shape of a coin, and at first I didn’t even understand what it was that I was looking at. Weirdness is so underrated.
```

```
Another fun fact regarding eye migration in flatfish: Because the eyes start out symmetrical in the larvae and one eye migrates to the other side, the optic nerves twist around each other in the adult. And at least one species has a double twist in their optic nerves, likely due to a double migration…

Ever time I thought it couldn’t get any God damned weirder… you made it even more God damn weirder!

Well, Mr. Meaney, you did it again! I enjoy your displays so much. Every time. I love fish-and I have eaten halibut, years ago-and I liked it, but then I saw what it looked like and haven’t eaten it again. I thought maybe trying again, just to see, but you’ve killed it-dead-in me now-haha! And, someti…

Mind satisfactorily blown!

I especially love the Turbellaria mimic! But I have always been fascinated by mimics.

“Alright guys lets play some chess… Alright very funny guys who the heck put a fish on the board?”

Lol they suck to fish for too. I went halibut fishing while I was stationed up in Alaska its like pulling a wet mattress up from the bottom of the ocean.
```

```
Hope you didn't flounder too much coming up with that final pun.
```

```
Great answer and images, thank you, Gary. I’m quite omnivorous but I’d have to draw the line at eating any of these weird critters. Identifiable body parts in my food tend to freak me out. If I were to be served a whole flatfish complete with eyes (I’m not sure if that’s even a thing), I’d take one…

Amazing. Never realized they were that varied. Thanks for sharing.

Now I'm convinced that someone managed to summon Cthulhu.

AMAZINGLY DONE!!!

They say space is the final frontier but it seems the deeper we are able to go in the oceans the weirder the inhabitants. We still have a lot to learn about the creatures at the bottom of the ocean. Looking forward to more of your fascinating posts and pictures. Thanks for this.

Mr Meaney you have got THE coolest answers. I love seeing your name in my feed because I KNOW I’m going to be enlightened in a most entertaining and engaging way. Thank you

Oh, that was fun! But my hero was Jacques Cousteau! I loved him!

My son is a marine biologist and teaches it. I wanted to share these pics with him but couldn’t copy.

These flat fish flounder and Greenland Halibut are so cool. Thanks for the pictures.

I want to believe that “Amorphous blobby flatfish” is its official designation. The World definitely needs a fish called the amorphous blobby flatfish
```

Did I see a couple of what looks like nudibranch photos. They're not flatfish, are they?
```

```
This is so fascinating that it’s almost unacceptable. Great commentary, too! Thank you.
```

```
And you didn’t even mention the fact that they can produce ethanol instead of lactic acid as byproduct in fueling cells with glucose, like yeast! They can use it as antifreeze in their blood! They survive lack of oxygen!
```

```
Whoa…. But, if eyesight is damaged, it should not be able to camoflage, right? How come the fish is one fourth camoflagued in that picture?

As the chef on a cruise my wife and I took many years ago said; “A fish so ugly, you are doing it a favor by killing it, and eating it.”

```
An interesting tidbit, in Japan, flatfish are displayed in one direction, so if a fish's eye migrates the other way, they are sold upside down (their bottom pale part towards us) and at cheaper prices.
```

```
Now I want to know how the flat fish's eye migrates over to join the other one on its side!
```

Another animal that is weird are freshwater flukes. These tiny creatures live in ponds or puddles in the land, you'd probably mistake them for a small piece of dead vegetation until you notice them swimming. Their anatomy is fairly simple. What I found out about these strange creatures is that if th…

Related to the first part, I think that the fact Psettodes exists (existed?) is even weirder regarding the position of it's eyes. It looks so weird lol

“Showing that was the… sole purpose of my answer”

There’s a plaice for everything, especially when dabs are added. Just be sure not to flounder!
```

So I guess, because of the way fish do it, the males in the dimorphic species don’t know if they are “mating” with ones like themselves or with ones more like their mirror images. But are they biased against each other? Or are they smarter than humanoids? Star Trek - Committed to Hatred ***…

They are wonderful fish, are soles.
