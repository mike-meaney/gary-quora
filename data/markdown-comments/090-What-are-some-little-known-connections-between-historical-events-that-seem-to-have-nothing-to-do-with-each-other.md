## The Curse of the Bamboo Flower

Roughly every 50 years, Melocanna baccifera flowers. It is a species of bamboo, distributed across India and Southeast Asia, and can grow to be up to 25 metres tall. This cyclical event is known as mautam in some northeast Indian states.

The first record we have of mautam is from the year 1862, in the Mizoram state of India. Directly after the flowering, the region experienced an infestation of black rats and, subsequently, fell into famine. Fast forward to the next mautam, in 1911, another plague of rats. 1958, the same thing.

In fact, this phenomenon - bamboo flowering and then a huge spike in rat numbers - has been seen all over the world, not only in India but also in China, Myanmar, Laos, Japan, Madagascar and South America. This can’t be coincidental.

So what is happening? As it turns out, when M. baccifera and other bamboo species flower, they release countless seeds, which in turn fuel a population explosion in the local black rats. Once the seeds have all been eaten, the rodents turn to nearby villages to look for food, in what is known as a “rat flood”.

Nowadays, this has long since been realized, and now the Indian government prepares for mautam before the flood hits. The last one was in 2006, and villagers were educated about pest control and encouraged to grow crops whose scents would ward off rats.

The next famine is expected to hit Mizoram in the mid-2050s, and the local Mizos know it. It must be strange to live in the knowledge that such an event is impending. It's also pretty amazing that the reproductive cycle of a plant has such a major effect on the lives of so many.

New Zealand has similar but less predictable “mega mast years” where the indigenous beech trees produce huge amounts of seeds. This feeds the invasive rat and stoat population. While this is not an agricultural threat, given that most remaining beech forests are at altitude in lands unsuitable for ag…

I first heard about this when I visited the Andes in Chile four years ago. In 2011–2012, several cases of Hantavirus occurred amongst campers and hikers who visited a popular national park in Southern Chile. Then villagers living in the same area became infected and the authorities became so concern…

Does the rat boom cause any increase in other species that eat rats, like snakes or cats?

The previous cycle before the one in 2006 was so disastrous for Mizoram that it caused a famine and the central governement of India did very little to help the mizos. This led to an ethnic mizo rebellion against the the Union of India which went on for years. A blooming bamboo plant caused an armed…

There are locust explosions in Africa that are insane (happening right now!) Does anyone know of a similar connection to plants or another natural trigger, that leads to this plague of locusts?

Truly spooky!

Fascinating. This type of answer is why I still read Quora.

Hi Garry, good one. Do you know why it flowers every 50 years? Whats the evolutionary angle?
```

```
Amazing

I wonder does the name “mautam” got anything to do with maut (Hindi word for death) ?

The Black Plague was caused by the denunciation of Pope Gregory IX. He pronounced that cats were devils, evil, and all that crap. This led to major exterminations of cats. Well, you can guess who profited most from the lack of cats: rats. So, a silly religious pronunciation without any basis in fact…

Hmm perhaps a widespread effort to ‘vacuum’ up the seeds, or start fires that destroy the seeds, etc. should be done. Or spray poison, etc.

What is the third picture showing?

When in a steady state, there is an equilibrium between prey and predator. Given typical depredation rates, the generous “surplus” offspring that rats reproductively produce offset those loses without too serious of an extinction threat. Interfere with that finely balanced equation, either naturally…

Do you know what plants are grown to deter the rats? Have been looking g for myself as the recent mild winters have resulted in a population explosion round here and would dearly like some plants to keep them away from the property. The internet has proved to be useless in this case.

I have heard of these plagues before. I knew the connector but didn't know the precise cause (the seeds). Thanks for the solution to something read about in passing.

What's going on in the picture?

Rat meat is rich in proteins, like every other mammal. Just saying.

If the seeds are that nutritious, maybe they should be harvested.

Nightmare stuff

How did the pest control measures work in 2006?

Just one correction please- The term is “Mausam” and not “Mautam”- Mausam means season while mautam means mourning. :)

How does it reach South America?
