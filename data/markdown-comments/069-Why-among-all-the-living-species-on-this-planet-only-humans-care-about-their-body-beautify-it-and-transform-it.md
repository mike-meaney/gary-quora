## When Insects Play Dress-Up

There are innumerable species which care very much about the appearance of their body. In most animals, one sex tends to be picky about who they mate with. This is generally the females - since they bear the young, they invest a lot more energy into reproduction than the males, and thus ought to have the most genetically gifted offspring possible. They want more bang for their buck, in other words.

So, to impress prospective mates, hopeful animal suitors employ a vast array of “sexual display” tactics. The most common strategies include dances, displays of dominance over competing males, impressive structures on the body such as antlers, and of course vibrant colouration.

However, beautification and transformation of the body is far from as universal as that. In fact, I can think of only one non-human example of an animal deliberately altering its appearance with external material in order to be more attractive: the bearded vulture.

Also known as the lammergeier, the bearded vulture is a fascinating bird - up to 90% of its diet can consist solely of bone, and one individual is thought to have killed the famous ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus by dropping a tortoise on his head.

Bearded vultures also frequently bathe themselves in dust and mud which is rich in reddish iron oxides. The result is that, despite their actual plumage being white underneath, they always have a vivid red, orange or gold colour.

They do this for no apparent reason other than to beautify themselves, making this behaviour both a very interesting example of tool use and the only instance of cosmetics in the animal world (that I’m aware of).

That being said, it is quite common for creatures (invertebrates, mostly) to get dressed up not to attract attention, but to avoid it. This is known as self-decoration camouflage, and has cropped up a surprising number of times in evolution. First of all, there are insects, such as Acanthaspis petax.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fba3952bf75bf9436c33698e6b9c3a15-lq)

This East African creepy crawly kills ants, sucks out their organs with digestive enzymes, and stacks their desiccated carcasses atop its back in order to camouflage itself. This may be to break up its silhouette, or just to render itself unrecognizable to predators. Whatever the case, it’s metal as hell.

The young nymphs of another assassin bug species, the masked hunter, coat themselves in dust and sand to blend in with the environment.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-449baae86d552cb5bf10feb9e28aa86a-lq)

Caddisfly larvae wear protective “cases” - tubes of sticky, secreted silk which are covered in debris such as pebbles, shells, and plant matter. One artist gave some captive larvae pieces of gold and gemstones to build their cases from, with beautiful results.

The larvae of many lacewings also like to wear debris, although this is to disguise themselves from potential prey. Like Acanthaspis petax, they often cover themselves in the corpses of their past victims; aphids in this case. Eventually this leads to them looking like some abomination from The Thing.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6a9f6e9203b357f4d6db18c36f48fcd2-lq)

In fact, insects have been using debris to camouflage for a long, long time. Hallucinochrysa, an extinct 100 million year old insect from Burma, did the exact same thing.

Self-decoration camouflage can also be observed in the oceans. The textbook example is the aptly-named decorator crabs, of which there are around a dozen species. They attach sponges, crinoids, bryozoans, algae and other aquatic organisms to their carapaces, helping them go unseen by predators.

Some species even recruit venomous or otherwise harmful animals, such as stinging anemones, hydrozoans and noxious seaweeds, which are even more effective at warding off attackers.

The rather pretty candy crab has similar habits; it attaches live coral polyps to its spiny shell for camouflage.

Also, when threatened by predators such as sharks, octopuses may wall themselves up within seashells, although this tactic may have more to do with armouring than hiding. There’s a common octopus beneath the shelly lump pictured below.

So, long story short, self-adornment is a frequent occurrence in the natural world, but most of the time it’s for camouflage rather than beautification. It also seems to be restricted to marine life and insects, which I assume is because carrying around heavy debris is very hard on land, unless you’re really tiny.

I should, however, also mention that there are animals which decorate their environment so they can be more attractive. A shining example would of course be the bowerbirds, a family of avians native to Australia and New Guinea. The males build structures from twigs, or bowers, and then festoon them with colourful trinkets, like berries, flowers or even man-made objects.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6d271ab8d8baae396817077d037e557f-lq)

They colour-code the decorations, and sometimes even arrange objects according to their size so that smaller ones are closer to the foreground. This suggests that bowerbirds have a pretty sophisticated sense of aesthetics and that they understand perspective, which in itself is fascinating.

Anyway, thank you everybody for reading. I hope you found this answer interesting, have a great day.

They want more bang for their buck, in other words.

Except for does (female deer).

They want more bang from their buck.

A brilliant(!) article, thank you so much!

I’m glad you included the bower bird! They’re absolutely fascinating. And while they don’t necessarily ‘dress up’ or collect treasures to attract a mate, the myriad species of the bird of paradise show spectacular plumage during their mating dance. The males transform themselves, displaying and flas…

Who is that gaudily handsome jumping spider? Gob-smackin' gorgeous! Those scarlet scleras of the bearded vulture are freakey deakey looking, so to speak. I don't suppose the ferrous oxides that they frequent is internally contributory? That is considerably more crimson than the most severe eye irrita…

Answers like this are what makes it worth plowing through all of the vegan cat questions. I was familiar with most of the content (although the candy crab and jeweled caddisfly were pretty damn spectacular!) but it was so pleasant to scroll through such well-presented and finely illustrated examples…
```

```
The first thing that came to mind for me was the last that you mentioned. Not physical adornment, but the nest decorations to attract a mate. I wonder where they buy their furniture?
```

```
Bravo! I learned so much, and the photos are magnificent.
```

```
Another great post, Gary! Love that you closed with bowerbirds. Kept me reading all the way to the end!

“one individual is thought to have killed the famous ancient Greek playwright Aeschylus by dropping a tortoise on his head.”

Everyone’s a critic.

Just fabulous! Thank you!

My wife told me we should get some bowerbirds to help organize our closets. Solid plan?
```

```
Awesome answer! I didn’t realize how many I did actually know! Learned about the Caddisfly larvae in my General Ecology class last year. Such cool animals!
```

```
Your knowledge of the natural world never ceases to amaze me! Thank you so much for your contributions…

I've been wearing debris since 1977

I thought you’d mention bowerbirds. There is a fantastic Sir David Attenborough documentary where he talks about them and the camera work is exquisite.
```

Now I were a bowerbird, I could definitely go for such an attractive abode!!

Fascinating entry. Upvoted instantly. Thanks.

The Creationist rejoinder to this was always …these beautiful animals have such characteristics so that WE can express awe and wonder over them…they are great examples of the Creators handiwork. In other words, God did it…for us. So were the beauty of sunsets, and the crystallographic patterns discl…

Since few if any of us will have the opportunity to see an actual peacock spider it would be instructive to include a scale bar with the photo. What made them even more marvelous to me were the pictures of the little guys perched on a fingertip. So much beauty on such a small creature. I don't suppos…

Is it possible the bearded vultures bathe in the clay for parasite defense and the coloring is a nice side effect?

What's the spider in the first picture?

Always amazing Gary. Thank You!!!
