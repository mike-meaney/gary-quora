Aside from birds? That’s hard to tell. Some crocodylians have complex social structures, use tools or hunt in packs. Some turtles have been observed to be adept at solving mazes, while giant tortoises exhibit impressive learning skills. However, we have most evidence for intelligence in reptiles with the monitor lizards.

Monitors are a diverse family of over seventy species, found in southern Asia and most of Africa and Australia. The largest (and most well-known) species is the 3-metre long Komodo dragon of Indonesia, while the smallest is the 23-centimetre Dampier Peninsula monitor of Australia. Most are carnivorous, but a few Filipino species eat fruit.

There’s a pretty good selection of evidence suggesting that they are very smart for reptiles, including:

*   An experiment on captive rock monitors (pictured) which suggests they can count up to six. The lizards were repeatedly presented with two compartments, each containing four snails. Then, they removed a snail in the first compartment, and - instead of moving on - the lizards searched for the missing morsel in confusion. This worked for treats of up to six snails.

*   In one instance, a Nile monitor in Kruger was observed to actively corral fish into a dead end. In a shallow pool of water, it would whoosh the fish into an inlet on the fringes where they’d have to leap over its body to escape. As they did so, the lizard would catch the fish in its jaws. This is a novel and creative hunting strategy, also seen in Merten’s water monitor of Australia.

*   The same species, which inhabits most of Africa, has been twice documented hunting cooperatively in pairs. In both cases, one of the monitors aggravated a mother Nile crocodile, luring her away and into the water. Meanwhile, the second lizard dug up the croc’s nest, and the first one returned so they could both feed on the eggs. Apparently, bird’s nests have also been raided by Nile monitors in this fashion .

*   In captivity, Komodo dragons have a wide range of behaviours typically associated with intelligent animals. Individuals have distinct personalities, and recognize the faces of their keepers. Additionally, they’re one of the only reptiles which have been seen at play - in zoos, they often play with objects such as shovels, buckets, shoes, or specially-made toys for enrichment.

*   Lastly, captive monitors can be trained almost like dogs. This ranges from basic things, like eating out of their owner’s hand, to much more impressive feats like toilet-training, walking with a dog leash or even tricks. One YouTuber trained their savannah monitor to wave his foreleg when he wanted something. I also found another user who is training his lizard to hunt rats.

So, with all this evidence in mind, I’m convinced that monitor lizards are quite possibly the most intelligent type of reptile. This is yet another example of brain size being deceptive, as, relative to the size of their bodies, monitors have very small brains.

The BNBC showed film of one of their presenters sitting with some captive Komodo dragons. One of them was pretending to be asleep, with eyes closed, except every time the human shut his eyes the dragon open ed his eyes and watching him, only to close his eyes and pretend to sleep as soon as the huma…

Though not technically monitors, Tegus are very smart as well. They can even be housetrained like a dog or cat.

Pretty cool for being cold-blooded.

I'll be monitoring for any updates.

Hi Gary In the experiment of the lizard counting it makes me think that they have a concept of the past in recognizing a snail missing. I wonder if there was any thought that they have concept of the future. Thank you for your lively informative posts, they are very interesting and a great contributio…

A friend caught this on his CCTV today. We were wondering what are they doing?

Few things makes me more excited than when a so-called “lowly” animal shows evidence of intelligence. At a recent trip to my local aquarium, I was chatting with a fish keeper for the arapaimas of how they were working on training them to swim into a stretcher and training the archer fish to spit on c…

What's interesting about the snail one is that humans have been known to be able to count instantly up to groups of about 6 or 7. If we see five apples on a tray, we could easily and instantly say there are 5 apples without counting them. However, this typically doesn't work for numbers greater than…

I had a monitor lizard that would play hide and seek with us. He would run behind or under a piece of furniture and peek its head out, then wait for us to come chase him, running behind another piece of furniture and repeating. When he got bored or tired, he would crawl to one of us to be picked up.…

I have always considered monitor lizards to be aggressive, dangerous (larger ones) animals. (The closest wild ones are about 6,000 miles away so they are not really a threat to me regardless)

Is this incorrect? Do some people keep them as friendly pets?

I'm curious. Why does the answer start with 'aside from birds'? Are birds reptiles? Thank you for the informative answer.

do they really need to be “trained to hunt rats”? :-)

Didn't know birds were reptiles.
