## The Mystery History of a Very Round Seal

That is a good question - as you say, Russia’s Lake Baikal is where you’d least expect to find wild marine mammals. The nearest ocean water to the lake is the Sea of Okhotsk, with over 1,500 kilometres of dry land in between. Nevertheless, Lake Baikal is the haunt of the Baikal seal, the world’s only exclusively freshwater pinniped and also the smallest species in the group.

Also known as nerpas, Baikal seals usually measure between 1 and 1.4 metres long and weigh, on average, 63–70 kilograms. Thankfully, they’re classified as Least Concern by the IUCN, with about 100,000 individuals in their ranks. The primary food source of the nerpa is the golomyanka, a very strange species of fish found in the lake.

At the end of the day, we really don’t know for sure how Baikal seals got to Lake Baikal. Some speculate that their ancestors made their way there by way of the Paratethys - a huge inland sea which occupied a sizeable chunk of Eurasia during the Miocene, of which the Black, Caspian and Aral Seas may well be remnants.

The idea is that Miocene seals living in the Mediterranean would have come up through the Paratethys and then, over millennia, migrated along connective rivers and lakes all the way up to Lake Baikal - giving rise to another seal species, the Caspian seal, in the process.

However, this hypothesis definitely has its flaws. The Baikal seal is well-adapted to frigid climes (for their size, they have the largest claws of any seal, a feature which allows them to scrape out breathing holes in the ice), and thus don’t seem like animals of Mediterranean origins. They’re much more similar to the (usually) marine ringed seal of the Arctic Ocean.

Additionally, genetic studies show that Baikal seals are more closely related to ringed seals than Caspian seals. This would also throw the Paratethyan theory into question, as it maintains that both Baikal and Caspian seals are the result of the same inland migration. What’s more likely is that Baikal seals came from the Arctic.

Many species in Lake Baikal are clearly related to animals of the Arctic ocean, such as the omul (a common fish, endemic to the lake, pictured above), which is in the exclusively cold-water genus Coregonus. This would also explain the Baikal seal’s adaptations to an icy environment.

But the question still remains - how did seals cross the 2,000 kilometers which lies between the Arctic Ocean and the lake? Well, what we do know is that about 80,000 years ago, there was an enormous lake (twice the size of the Caspian Sea) in Siberia which was connected to Lake Baikal via the Angara River:

The only problem is that molecular clock evidence indicates that Baikal seals diverged, in an evolutionary sense, from other seals about 4 million years ago, long before this lake existed. It seems very likely that they migrated through Siberian lakes from the Arctic ocean, but - for now, at least - we don’t know anything about the nature of said lakes.

Irrelevant, but I have a random question: since the range of Siberian tigers at least used to touch Lake Baikal, are there any records of tigers preying on Baikal seals?

Oh, and great answer as always.

Wow I kind of wish I could upvote questions. I knew nothing of this and it’s fascinating.

Though on that final point, I imagine if there was a lake there 80,000 years ago, it isn’t at all impossible that there was also a lake there four million years ago.

Is it possible that humans brought the seals to Lake Baikal?

Ah yes, the mystery of the Baikal seals! That one has had me scratching my head for many years indeed! I can only suspect it has something to do with the Angara River, which originates by the city of Irutsk which in turn become the Nizhryaya River, that flows to the Arctic Ocean via the Yenisei Rive…

Another very good answer. Congrats!

Very cool. Thanks!

very informative answer thanks for sharing.

Your posts never fail to impress me and make me want to know more about animals (that I know a considerable amount of/about without a degree in zoology, etc.). I’m really itching to know where this seal species came from!

The explanation I think is the most reasonable is the lake-river-lake hypothesis: Over several million years (years when various lakes came into and out of existence) the seals slowly migrated inland. Siberia has a long history of glaciation and lake formation. Those seals didn’t evolve in Baikal (a…

That four-million year gap isn't necessary odd. All it means is that their populations were diverging before the migration. Plus, we should expect that the genetic common ancestor lived about 10 years x the population size of the original population before the actual split. (2 x the population gener…

Could the ancestors of the Baikal Seal have diverged 4 million years ago while still living in the Arctic, for reasons other than geographic isolation, and from that stock those that migrated to Lake Baikal 80,000 years ago survived while those that stayed in their “homeland” died out? Perhaps their…

The quartenary glaciations began some 2-3 million years ago. It is quite possible that ice dam lakes formed aboutish the same place, giving a longer possible time window for the migrations. Still, a bit off of the genetic marker clock, but there might have been isolated populations also before migra…

The only problem is that molecular clock evidence indicates that Baikal seals diverged, in an evolutionary sense, from other seals about 4 million years ago, long before this lake existed. I suppose they could have existed as a separate species in the Arctic that then died out after a population of t…

Wow. That fish is strange…
```

```
Just because they're endemic to Baikal and their divergence began 4 million years ago, doesn't mean that they reached Baikal 4 million years ago. They could have diverged from other seals in another environment for different reasons and then found their way into Baikal and continued there. That mean…

We know that glaciations repeated and what 80.000 years ago (e.g. in Bosporus) happened happened several times before. There was more than one cold period during ice age, and ice age is minimum 3 million years old. Deglaciation happened several times in Asia as well as (see great lakes) in North Amer…
