Ooh, I’ve been waiting for a question like this. I love to show off the beauty of animals, especially underrated ones. Here are my nominations:

*   Jewel caterpillars, family Dalceridae. Both mesmerizing and strangely edible-looking, their exoskeletons are covered in gelatinous beads which give them their name.

*   Another type of caterpillar (I have a thing for caterpillars), the Wattle Cup caterpillar. Though its adult form is a dull moth, the larvae are colorful and have huge stinging tubercles.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-77d84ff4df741b73303d1b44d6a42a08)

*   The ant Echinopla striata, a Southeast Asian species related to carpenter ants, which is a striking metallic blue. This is a very obscure species so there’s virtually no other information on it.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d54f6d249b53119e50e6e8b80c4784ed-lq)

*   A species of darkling beetle known as Eucyrtus gloriosus (the specific name of course meaning “glorious”), which has a lovely color scheme of shiny purple and gold.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-53b6ac8385087e0d31ca3f7c7f7dc2d4-lq)

*   The passionvine treehopper, also known as the fluffy bum. Yes, seriously. They have a tuft of white filaments on the end of their abdomens, which can be moved up and down and are used for display.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-4840857f061406806a18b7cd2d1e5e63-lq)

*   The endangered trilobite beetle, Platerodrilus sp. Obviously, they’re not actually related to trilobites, but are named so due to their flattened bodies and large scales. They can be huge, too - 8 centimetres long when fully grown.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-25bed9d23134f0091c1f77704fd14785-lq)

*   The larvae of agrid sawflies, which are deep purple in colour. They resemble caterpillars greatly, but there are differences - mainly different numbers of legs and eyes.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-96626e50c6e900abbdc8d92248ae1577-lq)

*   The incredible-looking lace bugs, family Trilinidae. Their wings are beautiful, reminiscent of stained-glass mosaics. The intricate, lace-like network which causes this appearance is what gives them their name.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-01bb5cc151461e02e8424e128b17670b-lq)

*   Stick insects which, like scorpions, are fluorescent under ultraviolet light. Normally they may look drab, but when exposed to UV light they take on this alien appearance.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0e7e06bcb5268d0ac7d0bdeba648d324-lq)

*   Eumastacid monkey grasshoppers, which come in many different colours. They hold their hind legs horizontally, at right angles to the body, which is bizarre indeed.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-45eb361806ccee77d1e2f1a2818dcd7f-lq)

*   There are many beautiful mantises, but I think orchid mantises are the most out of all of them. They’re probably the least obscure species on this list, and mimic flowers to deceive both predators and prey.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-176d34307f4861f297e7aad09ce15758-lq)

There are many more breathtaking insects, and these are just my obscure few suggestions. A lot of people don’t realize how diverse insects really are.

EDIT: A suggestion from [Michalis P.](https://www.quora.com/profile/Michalis-P-2 "www.quora.com"); the steelblue ladybird (or ladybug if you’re American), Halmus chalybeus. These carnivorous beetles are a startling iridiscent blue-green and definitely qualify.

I was staggered a few years back when I learned about Tribolite beetles. Had you read this?

Bizarre-Looking Beetle Has an Even Weirder Sex Life

Fascinating.

When I was slightly younger I admired caterpillars big time. There was a mulberry tree in our garden and it attracted many fluffy little cute ones. I loved them. Until the day I saw a badass looking caterpillar. I wrongly assumed it would like some petting. It didn’t. Little shit gave my hand such a…

Many new loves!

I wished this answer could have gone on and on. Such great picks. So many insects are so cool-looking.

I have admired the walking sticks I have seen around mi casa, but have never seen one in UV. Thank you.

Fascinating and beautiful creatures.

So refreshing to see posts like this on Quora rather than wading through the same thousands of questions…will trump be impeached and is Stairway to Heaven not the greatest song in the world questions. Thanks for posting and the beautiful pics.

You just made my evening! How glorious! Thank you for posting your answer

I wish to second the nomination for anything called a “fluffybum”

Wow, I love Butterflies and dragonflies. And I’m very fascinated by praying mantises. They’re so cool when they turn their heads to look at you. (On that tiny tiny neck!) I don’t mind the odd grand daddy long legs in the bathroom. I remember my dad showing them to me and them walking over our hands.…

Trilobite beetles look surprisingly like videogame lava cave bosses.

It’s regrettable they’re endangered.

Great. Now a bunch of rich kids will want some.

Thought you may apreciate this shot… yes, that's my fingernail.

Also my profile pic.

It was a pleasure to read. I have my masters in Zoology with specialization in entomology.

Thank you, they truly are beautiful. Nature’s paint brush did good.

Thanks Gary - another answer that shows the very best of Quora. This is why I love it - when enthusiastic and knowledgeable people like yourself are generous enough to share both of those things with the rest of us! Very much appreciated!

Each one of these magnificent bugs are truly beautiful. I was hesitant to scroll through the list in fear that a certain arachnid of the 8 legged variety would be on the list or it’s predator, the centi- and/or millipede but was happy to see that none graced this list. Thanks for sharing such beauti…

I particularly like dragonflies, but they’re too difficult to capture on pictures. Once I saw a red one, I new that I wouldn’t had the chance to take it on picture so I stared at it for a while, to watch it, so beautiful but fast, it stayed longer than I thought, I remember taking a picture but, it…

Just Beautiful! I am going to add this to my Art space! The Color of Art!

The darkling beetle reminds me of Thanos.

WOW! Thanks so much for sharing, definitely one of the most interesting things I have ever seen on Quora.

These are absolutely gorgeous. Reminds me of the work of Tiffany. I always look forward to your posts. Thank you for sharing your knowledge.

Sorry

I just had to say it

Could you add the steel blue ladybug?

Breath taking, I loved reading this. That beetle is rather scary though.

That ant looks like blueberries on legs

I saw some of those metallic ants while on holiday in Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. I was completely in awe of them.

Such beauty and colour. The natural world has influenced all kind of design — fabric, decor, paints, symbols expressing behaviours. For all these insects from foreign countries (to me) I wonder what long lost cultures made of their inspiration in ceremonial robes, tributes to their gods and more tha…
```

```
OH my, whoever was responsible for creating these critters had a magnificent imagination. Such vibrancy is mesmerising.
```

```
It is a pity most of these insects beautiful as they are a rather tiny. Of course, we have plenty of showy butterflies or jewel beetles, but some of those delicate lace wings or damsel flies are really beautiful. Quite a few artists took an inspiration from those nearly microscopic bugs.
```

```
The sawflies are not purple, at least not in this photo, but blue. Purple is blue with some red in it. I don’t see any red there.
```

```
Seeing the first one, I thought it was some designer swimming bed.
```

```
I absolutely fell in love with peacock spiders
```

```
These indeed are all quite beautiful, but give me the shivers, as I can’t stop thinking—”do they bite?”
```

```
That's a really interesting collection! Got to know new species, Thanks for the answer.

There is this ‘Buprestidae’ family of beetles that are literally called ‘Jewel beetles'.
```

```
No 4 should be called the Thanos beetle
