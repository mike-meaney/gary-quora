Solifuges

Also known as camel spiders, solifuges are arachnids, not quite spiders though, which can grow to over six inches in diameter. In addition to this, they have enormous chelicerae and are covered in long hair. Also, they can run at an impressive 16 km/h. In other words, they’re pretty damn scary.

There are many, many myths about solifuges. Roman manuscripts erroneously cited them as responsible for the evacuation of an entire African nation. Urban legends seriously exaggerate their size, speed, ferociousness and dangerousness. One family in Essex evacuated their home when they found a solifuge in it, and claimed it killed their dog.

However, none of that is true. Solifuges are more or less harmless; there are a few recorded cases of people getting mild nips, but they are entirely non-venomous. The myths surrounding their venomousness arose when a paper stated that solifuge “venom” was fatal to a test mouse.

However, since there is no way the solifuge could administer the venom and the substance was injected into the mouse, it’s established that this is just a non-venom substances which is lethal in the bloodstream (many animals’ blood and saliva are).

Is that some version of what I named a bunny wasp when I moved to the desert, but is actually called a sun spider, or whip scorpion? Never before had I lived somewhere I couldn’t play with all the bugs. I got so excited when I first spotted one of those, was about to pick it up, when uncharacteristic…

It feels like you are presenting solifuges as a species of animal, or as a group of animals that are all very similar in characteristics. I’d like to correct this misconception, in case some people get the wrong idea. A solifuge is not a species it is an order of animals with a wide variety of very d…

I also heard that if they look like they are running at you, they are just running to your shadow

I remember reading somewhere that they also got a bad rep because they seem to chase people and are very fast as well. In reality what they actually do is to try to hide from the sun (that’s what solifuge means in the first place), so it’s not uncommon for someone to be on a desert and one of these…

I had one of those up inside my shirt once while I was in the army. When I felt something and looked, I thought the legs were just dry grass before realizing that is was a monster I hadn't even known existed. I have still not fully emotionality recovered…

It doesn't need poison for crying out loud. You get a heart attack by looking at it.

Looks like creators of “predator” are inspired from this creature.

It looks like it consumes fear and toenails.

Camel spiders have one of the most powerful bites in the insect or arachnid world. And it can be delivered very, very quickly. They are not 8-legged teddy bears and should be treated with caution and respect.

They just wanna chill… in your shadow. It’s cool, no problem at all. Also, are they edible or poisonous? And no, poisonous usually doesn’t mean venomous, unless if some unfortunate prey was envenomed, then it is temporarily poisonous to eat, obviously.
