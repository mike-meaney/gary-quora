There are innumerable candidates for this question, but here are some which I can think of off the top of my head.

*   Lancetfish: Little is known about the biology of this family of fish, which contains only two species. They can be very big, over 2 metres long in some cases, and are probably ambush predators which eat other fish, cephalopods and crustaceans. They’re found the world over, except for polar waters.

*   Jellynoses: Also known as tadpole fish, they get their name from the gelatinous tissue which fills their body. Deep sea creatures which feed on invertebrates living on the seafloor, they’ve lost most of their bone, instead having skeletons of mainly cartilage. They’re pretty big too, at up to 2 metres in length.

*   Kaluga: This sturgeon is quite possibly the world’s largest freshwater fish, at up to 5.6 meters long and weighing as much as a small car! They live only in the rivers of the Amur Basin in eastern Russia and China, and are the apex predators of their environment. As they’re not fussy eaters, I wonder if they eat the Amur softshell turtles which they co-exist with.

*   Flying gurnard: This fish, native to coastal waters in the Atlantic, is immediately noticeable, as it has very long pelvic fins. When alarmed, these fins fan out into huge, semicircular “wings”, which are translucent and often have blue patterns on them. It might seem exotic, but if you live on the Atlantic it’s probably not far off shore.

*   Sea robins: This family is most amazing to me because of their six, arthropod-like legs, which evolved from fin-rays. They use these to crawl around and also to smell. If that wasn’t weird enough, some species are armour-plated, they make drumming sounds with a muscle in their body and can glide using beautifully coloured fins.

*   Chinaman-leatherjacket: Don’t be fooled by this fish’ unassuming appearance - it’s one of the scariest ray-finned fish I know of. They have extremely sharp teeth and have been known to rip octopuses apart in swarms. They also kill fish as big as marlins, can crush fish hooks in their jaws and occasionally bite unfortunate divers.

*   Flabby whalefish: Among the deepest-living fish, these bright red monsters are damn weird. Many species are blind, instead relying on detecting vibrations to navigate. Strangest of all, the males only eat when they’re babies - after becoming adults, their mouths fuse shut and they slowly metabolize shells eaten as juveniles.

Thanks for reading, and hopefully you enjoyed learning about these bizarre types of fish which I think could use a little more attention.

Bookmarked! I learned about every animal I possibly could when I was younger, and yet I still learn about new species whenever you post an answer.
```

```
To summarise: the ocean is SCARY.

Thanks again for the information, Gary. I was wondering, do we have any images of the whalefish underwater? Surely, due to high pressures, they look different on land than they do in their natural habitat.
```

```
Mind repeatedly blown!
```

```
I wonder what giant freshwater sturgeon, catfish and rays think of swimmers.
```

```
Holy cow, that Kaluga is basically the biggest catfish I’ve ever seen. And I wonder if Jellynoses were the inspiration for Peter Watts’s Rifters, who likewise lose their bone mass to live deep underwater.
```

```
The “flabby whalefish?” Harsh!
```

```
Thanks Gary! Just keep wondering who comes up with these names!
```

```
For a quick second I thought the kaluga was an obese shark.
```

```
That's extraordinary zoological content.
```

```
Whoa, that Lancet Fish looks like a River Prowler from Subnautica!
```

```
If we cut open the flabby whale fish’s mouth again can they eat again? Lol
```

```
Boy! Weird!

But very interesting…thanks
```

```
“Uh, Dude, Chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature.”

🤣
```

```
My vote goes to the Sea Robin for overall similarity.
```

```
These are really interesting creatures!
```

```
Amazing, I haven’t heard most of them.
```

```
Well Sturgeon are more widespread with 9 species in North America and several more in the Mediterranean and Arctic ocean. And one in Lake Baikal.

Sturgeon of North America (Acipenseridae﻿)
```

```
I would have added the Alligator Gar.

Thing is one of those fish that is virtually unchanged for about 100 million years and can grow to 10 feet long and be around 300 pounds.
```

```
What’s the purpose of that big sail on the lancetfish?
```

```
Hmm…I’m convinced that the Lancetfish is, in fact, a fake snake that got lost and ended up in the ocean.
```

```
The Flying Gurnard is very reminiscent of the creatures in the movie, “The Abyss”.
```

```
Such a brilliant answer & question. I need bug pictograms these & more Sure there are many.
```

```
What is the evolutionary advantage of the flabby whalefish not being able to open their mouth?
```

```
Thanks for the flabby whale fish , it doesn’t sounds right at first thought, unless it’s plant like and can make its own food. Disregarding volume (size) you’ll lose mass as you use up energy if you don’t eat or synthesize. Interesting, shall check it out further.
```

```
But what do they taste like?!
```

```
The last one was pretty weird. They must have relatively short life-span.
