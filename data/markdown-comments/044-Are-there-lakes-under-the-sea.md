## A Toxic Lake at the Bottom of the Ocean

If you pour oil into a glass of water, the oil will, of course, float to the top - because it’s less dense. It’s almost like there’s a lake of water in the oil. So, if you had a fluid much denser than sea water, a similar principle could allow for a “lake” to form under the sea.

As it happens, such situations certainly do occur in the natural world. When deep-sea deposits of salt dissolve into the water, the result is an extremely saline “brine” which is significantly denser than normal seawater. It gathers in pools at the ocean’s floor, like this:

Here’s a good diagram to help explain:

I should note, these can also occur off the Antarctic coast due to salt becoming more concentrated in the remaining water during the formation of ice.

The dense brine acts in an eerily similar way underwater to water in air. There’s a clear surface and shoreline, and it ripples and forms waves on contact. Additionally, much of the time it’s very rich in methane, which has an interesting effect on the ecosystem.

Many bacteria are methanotrophs - in simple terms, they “eat” methane. Furthermore, some of these have formed a close relationship with certain species of mussels, by setting up shop inside the molluscs’ gills. They feed on methane and the mussels feed on the waste products they produce.

Because of this, you will often see a “beach” of mussels surrounding the lake of brine, filtering the methane from the water for their bacterial symbiotes. To make matters more interesting, there is a species of bacteria-eating snail which has the mysterious ability to detect the water the mussels alter, and seeks them out.

However, brine pools aren’t always beneficial for organisms. Their water is so incredibly saline - up to ten times that above the surface - and can also contain toxic chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide. Because of this, many marine creatures that chance a dive into one of the pools don’t come back out.

Fascinating. A good setting for some kind of sci-fi mussel harvesting culture. Some thirty years ago I wrote a story about a culture that had to adapt to sub-surface and sub-marine living and for some reason harvested manganese nodules that formed on the sea floor using manta ray like submarines. Sub…

Brine forms when salt water freezes, not when it melts. Salt is forced out of water when it freezes, forming salt-free ice, and the salt is concentrated in channels of brine that pours into the water below.

This effect (a halocline) can sometimes be seen quite clearly in the cenotes of the Yucatan Peninsula, where seawater and freshwater meet in the underground passages. This is a video which shows the halocline, best seen from about 30 seconds in when you see the bubbles pass up through it:…

Somehow when I read the title and saw the picture I thought the question was, “Are there snakes under the sea?”

This was so good, I just did not want it to end!
```

```
How deep are the pools?
```

```
Small nitpick but please remove the “oil floats because it is less dense” part, while it does go to the top (instead of the bottom) thanks to being less dense the reason it doesn’t dissolve is actually because it is non-polar but water is

“the result is an extremely saline “brine” which can be up to eight times denser than normal seawater”

No. It may have 8 times the salt concentration, but it won’t be 8 times as dense, or anything remotely like that (1.2 times denser I could believe). Solid iron isn’t that dense.

I should note, these can also occur off the Antarctic coast due to salt being produced by the melting of ice. That's the opposite. Melted ice is almost salt-free so it should be less dense than normal salt water. However, melted ice is so cold compared to the ocean temperature that it compensate the…

So Goo Lagoon from Spongebob is possible!

Just one thing that was completely wrong. Water doesn't mix with oil not because of their density differences - after all water and alcohol, which is way less dense, mix just fine, and are actually pretty hard to separate physically, you kinda have to use CaO to separate them - it's because oil is a…

I guess this is the logical explanation of the Goo lagoon in SpongeBob SquarePants 😂😂😂

How would it affect the human body?

Awesome, nature is so so amazing. Each day there’s something new to learn. Thanks for sharing this!

Gary Meaney, do these lakes also contains lots of halophiles?
