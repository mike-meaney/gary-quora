If there‚Äôs one group of animals which can compete with the outright weirdness of mantis shrimps‚Äô eyes, it‚Äôs the chitons. Chitons, or polyplacophores, are sea-dwelling mollusks which essentially resemble armoured slugs. They have a shell composed of eight plates, or valves, and will curl up into a ball when threatened.

All chitons have organs known as aesthetes, which are patches of light-sensitive cells, under their shells. However, many species have gone a step further and evolved full-on eyes, lens and all.

Chiton eyes are‚Ä¶ bizarre. Thousands of them cover the shell, so that together they act as a much larger compound eye and grant the chiton 180 degree vision, which by itself is pretty amazing. However, what‚Äôs weirdest about these eyes is what they‚Äôre made of.

Their lenses are made out of the same mineral, aragonite, as the rest of the shell, so chitons could be said to see with their armour. They‚Äôre the only animals in the world which have eyes made of rock!

If that wasn‚Äôt enough, chiton eyes evolved more recently than any other animal‚Äôs eyes - they appear in the fossil record about 10 million years ago. A fascinating organ for a fascinating group of animals. As an aside, this is the largest chiton, the gumboot chiton:

Growing to 36 centimetres in length, it‚Äôs often referred to as the ‚Äúwandering meatloaf‚Äù. Unlike other chitons, it has a layer of leathery skin over its shell, and eats using rows of teeth made of magnetite.

We‚Äôre getting really off track now, but as a final fun fact, researchers in California took inspiration from the growth of gumboot chiton teeth to develop a new way of growing nanomaterials for batteries and solar cells. It‚Äôs a great example of biomimicry.

God: makes some freaky shit

Okay, that is just too much mind-blowing for one answer!

Thank you! I had no idea about chitons, but they‚Äôre fascinating.

Magnetite‚Ä¶stupid question but‚Ä¶any relation to magnets?

A few years back on holiday in Barbados, I was strolling the beach in the evening when the tide was out. I noticed on the side of a rock that was usually submerged what seemed to be some sort of amazing fossil! I spent the next half an hour feet submerged in the ocean trying to dig the fossil out, o‚Ä¶

I just picked up a new epithet to use online.

‚ÄúYou sea-dwelling mollusk!‚Äù

Thank you.

It is fascinating organisms like this that give a lie to the creationist argument that only a fully formed eye is capable of seeing. But then, creationists were never really good at biology. Thanks for a great share.

IIRC, trilobites also had mineral lenses in their eyes, and optically quite good ones (excellent focus).

I must say I look forward to your posts. I love reading this kinda stuff and hopefully learning something new. If it wasn‚Äôt for you I‚Äôd never have known these creatures exist or many of the others you‚Äôve mentioned. Thank you so much for taking the time üòä

So‚Äî - lenses? So‚Äî- they can focus these eyes?? Form images‚Ä¶? But that's amazing! Behaviourally-speaking, what do they do with these images? It puzzles me that something that I'd have assumed has few behavior responses it can draw on, is nevertheless gathering so much info about its environment. What‚Ä¶

Your posts are a constant source of revelation and delight, thank you! ‚Äúwandering meatloaf‚Äù, just wonderful
```

How fascinating !
```

‚ÄúUnlike other chitons, it has a layer of leathery skin over its shell‚Äù

so the wandering meatloaf is also the leatherback turtle of chitons?

is that a example of convergent evolution? it‚Äôs awesome

Life is flipping weird, yo.

Since it can roll in to a ball it actually has Omni-vision (is that a word?) ‚Äòomnividence‚Äô and can see in every direction not just 360 degrees around but above, below and all around itself.

Where did you get the first picture?

it sounds like a pokemon
