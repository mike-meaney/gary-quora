Actually, they weren’t. Meet the late Fuegian dog:

Despite its name, this was no dog. Rather, it was a domesticated form of the culpeo, a species of fox which still inhabits much of the Andes mountain range:

Fuegian dogs were kept by the Yaghan people, an ethnic group which are found in the Southern Cone of South America. They were tawny or white in colour, and had erect, triangular ears and a bushy tail. One Argentine explorer described them as “a stunted cross between an Alsatian police dog and a wolf”.

They were used for hunting otters, and, apparently, for warmth. They would gather around their owners, “taking the shape of a kind of wrapping”, keeping them warm in the Patagonian cold. Such good boys.

However, some writers noted that they were much less loyal than a dog of the lupine kind. They would allegedly abandon their owners when they were in danger, and often wandered on their own.

Indeed, their eventual extinction was the result of years of extermination, because they posed a danger to cattle and even humans. The last Fuegian dog likely died out between 1880 and 1919. If they hadn’t gone extinct, then today we might have two species of domestic canine to choose from.

Excellent, informative answer!

Thanks!

There is/soonish going to be a choice of two domestic canine species as the Russians are working on domesticating foxes. Since nobody is quite sure how long it takes to actually domesticate a species their trying it.

My husky/hound mix takes on the form of wrapping sometimes. Good boys indeed!

Answers like yours here are the reason I haven’t given up entirely on Quora.

While it would have been something extraordinary to experience, and sad that they were extinguished, I believe that our pretty-thoroughly domesticated Canis familiaris would still sweep any popularity contest between the two species.

Another excellent piece! Many thanks for your contributions.

Very nice .

Informative……

Is there any chance that they were semi-domesticated? Maybe docile or tamed? By your description they don't appear completely domesticated.

There is also the Hare Indian Dog, a possible domestic coyote

Was the Hare Indian dog a domesticated coyote?

Culpeos still exist, so could the Fuegian dog be brought back over the course of some number of generations if we were to redomesticate and selectively breed them for Fuegian dog traits? And is there any effort underway to do so?

I had no idea, thanks!

I don’t know. I have several basenjis and I am very suspicious about them. They don’t quite have that dog thing down.

Gary, Do you know if Neanderthal or early Cro-Magnon people hunted with wolves they raised as puppies? I read this somewhere in the past but have forgotten the source.
