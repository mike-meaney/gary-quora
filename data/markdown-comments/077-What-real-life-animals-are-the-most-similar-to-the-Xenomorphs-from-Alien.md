Thankfully, we havenâ€™t come across any Xenomorphs in the real natural world. Yet. However, there certainly are a handful of very real creatures which have characteristics in common with the movie monsters. One group of animals that came to mind for me would be caecilians.

Though they could be mistaken for worms, caecilians are in fact legless amphibians. Up close, you can see their sharp teeth and sometimes even their saliva, which recall the dripping, drooling jaws of a Xenomorph. One species - the ringed caecilian - is thought to possibly even have venom glands in its fangs.

Thereâ€™s a lot more about these amphibians that makes them fascinating. They are nearly blind, can be up to 1.5 metres long, secrete toxic substances which can induce hemolysis, and have a pair of sensory tentacles in front of their eyes, as well as an extremely complex array of jaw muscles and hard calcite scales embedded within their skin. I suppose they deserve a full answer of their own somedayâ€¦

Anyway, back to the aliens. In the movies, they have a second, inner set of jaws within their mouth. There are in fact real life animals which have this same feature - moray eels.

Many fish have what are known as pharyngeal teeth; teeth located deep in the their throat. However, morays are unique in having a fully functioning, articulated set of pharyngeal jaws. When they open their mouth, these jaws lunge forward to grab onto prey, and retract as the mouth is closed.

Most fish swallow their food by using suction: they create a pressure differential between the surrounding water and their mouths, vacuuming up their victim. Moray eels cannot really do this effectively, as they live in cramped underwater tunnels. Instead, they have Xenomorph jaws.

Another sea creature which bears an uncanny resemblance to the fictitious extraterrestrials is Phronima, a deep-sea crustacean (an amphipod, to be more specific). In addition to its plated exoskeleton, it has what looks like a long crest extending from the back of its head, just like a Xenomorph. Despite appearances, this is in fact a huge pair of tubular eyes!

Weirdly enough, this is but one of two pairs of eyes Phronima has. Even stranger are its habits; a mother will track down a salp (a kind of gelatinous, sac-shaped animal), hollow out its viscera with her claws, and lay her eggs within the unwilling hosts. The disemboweled salp floats away with the current, and her offspring eventually emerge in new territory. Much like a chestburster!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7f85e34c571a5383cee2e967acd2de8a-pjlq)

Even more like chestbursters are parasitoid wasps. There are well over half a million species of parasitoid wasp, all from various different groups which have independently evolved the same grisly habits. They are united by their parasitic lifestyle - more specifically, they are parasites who kill their hosts, or parasitoids. There are myriad different ways they carry out their life cycle - far too many to discuss right now. Perhaps they too need a future answer.

Anyways, the most famous strategy employed by parasitoid wasps is the laying of eggs within a larger host - usually a caterpillar, though practically any kind of insect is used by one wasp species or another. When the eggs hatch, the newborn larvae begin to eat their host from the inside out, eventually emerging to the outside world like a baby Xenomorph.

The last animal I will bring up is Prasinohaema, a genus of tree-dwelling skinks found only on New Guinea and the neighbouring Solomon Islands. These lizards have an extraordinary tolerance for the acidic chemical biliverdin. We, too, contain biliverdin, but in minuscule quantities, and an excess of the stuff causes jaundice. If enough of it is present, we die.

The bloodstream of Prasinohaema skinks has a biliverdin concentration forty times higher than that lethal dosage! Believe it or not, their blood is actually bright green because of this content, making them one of only three vertebrates which donâ€™t have red blood. In any case, this reminded me of the acid blood of the aliens.

So, thatâ€™s my out of this world lineup of five curious creatures which meet your criteria. I hope you found this answer interesting, thank you all very much for reading, and have a great day.

Don't forget about crabs/face huggers:

Other creatures without red blood?
I presume you mean the blue tongues and the bobtail. Which have blue blood due to the presence of copper. one group of bobtails in perth have a genetic error which means their blood is green as a result of copper being the wrong oxidation state.
```

```
Well done, Sir!
```

```
Gruesome, yet as oddly compelling as the movie!

I guess that humans cannot visualize a truly, completely alien creatureâ€¦
```

```
This was an amazing article to read. Thank you. The caecilians are also quite interesting creatures. As far as I know little is known about them. Maybe you can enlighten us about them one day.
```

```
Is that a Caterpillar in the second to last picture?
```

```
What a superbly knowledgeable answer. I wouldn't have thought of the caecilians and I'd never even heard of the skink.
```

```
Thanks for a fascinating comparative discussion. The top right photo by Jodi Rowley reminds me of the infant creature that popped out of John Hurtâ€™s chest in Alien and skittered across the floorâ€¦.
```

```
The second set of jaws as a lethal weapon is based on Dragonfly nymphâ€™s extensible labium which can be shot forward with considerable force to impale prey.
```

```
I learned about the existence of caecilians as a child, but itâ€™s nice to finally see them, um, fleshed out some.
```

I like how you've made the xenomorph via an aggregate; there is nothing quite like it as we know, but it's great having a list of its inspirations!
```

```
Nicely done, thanks!
```

```
Fascinating read even if a tad gruesome.
```

```
Awesome as alwaysðŸ’™
```

```
Thanks! Very informative!!
```

This reminded me of Mel Brooks' Looney Tunes take on John Hurt's denouement..:
```

Fascinating.

ðŸŽ¶If the jaws open wide and thereâ€™s more jaws inside, thatâ€™s a morayðŸŽµ

Outstanding answer!
```

Learned 5 new things today! Thankyou
```

```
Those first ones were like graboids from Tremors!

They are really some smart geeks here. That some inert and useless knowledge can be so well presented makes me wonder. I keep arcane knowledge of things and once in a blue moon whip them out to unsuspecting listeners or in this case readers. I canâ€™t say I knew how to even pronounce the names. How muâ€¦
```

```
I likely will have troubled sleep tonight. Good to know, though!
```

```
Spongebobâ€™s Alaskan bullworm might have been based on thatâ€¦
```

```
Do dragonfly nymphs count? The extending mouthparts are more analogous to a lower jaw than an inner one, but they make up for it with a nice dark exoskeleton. Almost the same color as the Dog Alien, actually.
```

```
Excellent fascinating read to stumble upon. Thank you.
