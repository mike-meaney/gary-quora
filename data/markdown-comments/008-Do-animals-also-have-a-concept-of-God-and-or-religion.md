Perhaps. Chimpanzees in the Republic of Guinea habitually hurl rocks at special trees in the forest, the stones accumulating in “cairns”. Biologist Laura Kehoe, who first recorded the behavior using camera traps, hypothesizes that these could be “shrines” for the chimps and held sacred in some form of rudimentary religion.

Others say that this practice is just a form of communication, although the idea that only “special” trees are stoned is interesting and might seem to challenge this explanation.

Staying on the topic of chimpanzees, the famous primatologist Jane Goodall has observed another kind of uncannily religious-like behavior. In the Gombe, she’s seen her chimps performing ritual dances at the onset of the rains, or when they come across a waterfall. Here’s a video:

Goodall proposes that these displays could be an early, primitive form of “elemental worship”.

Now, elephants. According to Ronald K. Siegel, a psychopharmacologist who has studied elephant behavior extensively,

> "Elephants are aware of natural cycles, as they practice "moon worship," waving branches at the waxing moon and engaging in ritual bathing when the moon is full."

This isn’t all Siegel has to say on the matter. He’s also documented elephant funeral rituals, which are fairly well-known among animal fans, but he brings up some fascinating lesser-known points.

> When encountering dead animals, elephants will often bury them with mud, earth and leaves. Animals known to have been buried by elephants include rhinos, buffalos, cows, calves, and even humans, in addition to elephants themselves. Elephants have \[been\] observed burying their dead with large quantities of food fruit, flowers and colourful foliage."

The last part is especially revealing. Are these grave goods supplies for their dead friends in some proboscine afterlife, like the gold treasures of Egyptian pharaohs or hoards of Bronze Age kings? Perhaps.

One thing he doesn’t mention is that other herds of elephants have traditions of gathering all their dead into special places - elephant graveyards.

Besides elephants, there’s only one other animal I would say has proper funeral rites and not just elaborate mourning. Magpies, according to Dr Marc Bekoff, fashion “wreaths” of grass and lay them by their dead peers, and then stand vigil for a while. Similar behaviors are reported in ravens, but not scientifically documented.

Beyond that, chimps and dolphins guard their dead and, in the case of the former species, sit beside the corpse for hours in silence, but this might just be grief rather than a true funeral ritual.

There’s a teenage girl here on Quora who built up a good relationship with a local flock of crows, and was allowed to take part in what seemed to be a crow funeral, where they were all standing around a dead bird and seemingly paying their respects.

I liked that the video defined spiritually as the feeling of awe and wonder when faced with certain parts of the world rather than equating it to experience of some sort of divine presence. And as for what the chimps do when a sudden squall comes their way, or when encountering a fascinating and beau…

Elephants, these incredibly intelligent and sensitive creatures have a special place in my heart!

‘Only “special” trees are stoned.’

There are so many ways I could respond to this, but I won’t.

God doesn’t belong to just humans. Lol

To be fair, he doesn’t mention elephant graveyards because they are a myth. Elephants don’t go to any special place to die, and they can’t move their dead.

Rabbits have Watership Down. Bats have Silverwing. Why isn’t there an elephant religion novel yet?

Fascinating. Thank you for this. I think I'll try to research animal spirituality a bit more.

Rituals at ancient funerals are often mistaken for an utterance of religious behavior. Not necessarily. There is a phenomenon of (human) behavior known as “whistling in the dark”. It seems to be a simple an effective trick to reassure yourself that some apparent danger isn’t there: just do something…

I often hear that ants too perform funerals.

I BELIEVE that both animals and humans sense a phenomenon currently beyond scientific understanding but with someday will securely merge science and religion.
