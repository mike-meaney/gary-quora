I think that the most interesting and bizarre parasite of all would be rhizocephalan barnacles, but as I’ve written on them [before](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-oddest-lifeform-ever-discovered/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com"), I’ll go with a close second - the snubnosed eel.

The snubnosed, or pug-nosed, eel - scientifically termed Simenchelys parasitica \- is perhaps the most gruesome and grisly parasite I can think of. As juveniles, they are ecologically similar to hagfish - deep sea scavengers, although they sometimes feed on microscopic crustaceans.

However, as they grow up, they get a lot more nasty. They become parasites of larger fish - halibut, for example. The eels latch onto their host and then start slowly burrowing in, sometimes going all the way to the spine, or even finding themselves in the fish’ abdominal cavity.

Imagine how agonizing that must be for the host fish - to have another animal gradually worm its way into your body. But it gets worse.

In 1992, fishermen at Montauk, New York State, landed a huge shortfin mako shark - 395 kilograms in weight, in fact. They cut it open and discovered two snubnosed eels, each close to a foot long, nestled inside the shark’s heart, feeding on its blood.

How they got into the heart is unclear, but scientists hypothesize that perhaps they entered the gills or even the throat of the mako, and from that point somehow got into the circulatory system. In any case, the eels had been there long enough for much of the damaged heart tissue to regenerate.

To have an eel burrow into your heart must be one of the most excruciating things in the whole natural world. I, for one, am glad I’m not a fish.

I expect the big eels didn't burrow into the heart. More likely, the small eels penetrated a big enough vein that conveyed them to the heart, where they settled in & grew.
```

```
Irony of ironies: you’re a shark that survives having two parasitic eels taking up residence in your heart, but it requires a human doing some sport fishing to kill you.
```

```
Yikes! I’m glad you’re not a fish, too. Myself, I’m a little close for comfort.
```

```
This might sound stupid, but how can a highly complex vertebrate animal live inside another animal’s heart? How did this fish get oxigen and didn’t suffocate?
```

```
I've never felt so sorry for a shark!
```

```
Aghhh! Me too.
```

```
Where exactly is the line crossed between a parasite, and just a very slow predator?
```

```
Such intelligent design from a benevolent creator ! I wonder how theists would explain that one?
```

```
Must be a heartbreaking experience.
```

Fish don’t have pain receptors. That probably isn’t true for all fish because ‘fish’ refers to a huge variety of different aquatic phylums, but overall it’s true.

So maybe the fish had a deep, cringe feeling instead?
```

```
Well, not THAT fish, anyway. We were discussing “death by boiling” the other day.

I think, in that case, I’d rather be the fish.
```

```
how do organisms like this contribute to the ecosystem? they shouldnt exist. they give nothing to their environment. they only harvest, damage, and reproduce. no balance. no mutual benefit. im surprised the ecosystem hasnt eradicated this useless, selfish organism from existence. i must be missing so…
```

```
I think there would be some kind of defense mechanism here too. Most probably the eels would be secreting some kind of anesthesia to numb the pain.
```

```
The kissing bug drops it feces on a human. The feces sometimes contain the Chagas parasite. In about ten years it turns your heart into Swiss cheese.
```

```
What this about fish don’t feel pain?
```

```
As far as I am aware fish don't have a nervous system, or much of one. They therefore wont feel anything.
```

```
How do they breathe inside the host’s body?
```

```
Wait, the eel’s gills work inside BLOOD?!
```

```
you mean this kind of parasites?
