The other answerers’ submissions are all well and good, but If I’m honest, I think I can do them one better with these critters.

Rhizocephala

If I was to bet on the most bizarre animal in the world, my submission would be the barnacles of the superorder Rhizocephala. They’re also pretty spine-chilling, and of course they’re parasites too.

A Rhizocephalan begins life as a larva called a nauplius. It is this stage in the life cycle alone that identifies them as a crustacean, let alone a barnacle, they’re so absurd. This is a Rhizocephalan nauplius:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c7e3c28ac4fbb3e51530295382c5d4c4-lq)

As crustacean larvae go, they look fairly standard, except for one thing - they completely lack a digestive system. No mouth, no gut, no anus. As such, the larvae don’t eat at all; they just float around and molt several times.

After they’ve molted enough times, they become an adult, or cyprid. The normal barnacles you see encrusted on rocks at the beach are in the cyprid stage. However, a Rhizocephalan cyprid is absolutely nothing like that of any other barnacle.

They have no legs or appendages, no segmentation (both crucial features of all other arthropods), and virtually no internal organs except a handful of muscles and reproductive bits. If the cyprid is female, it’ll attach itself to an unwitting host - usually, a crab, but sometimes a shrimp or other decapod.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-40734d0254db9444f9262baa50879dca)

Once it attaches, it metamorphoses into the final stage. The female literally injects most of her internal cell mass into the crab. This shapeless soup of cells becomes a network of roots which snake throughout the inside of the host’s body - these roots are collectively known as the interna.

And, yes, it’s going to get a lot, lot stranger. Where the crab’s reproductive organs (now eaten by the barnacle) once were, a large bulbous sac grows - the externa, pictured above. Here’s some more externae (externas?), marked with the letters “ex”.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b6d2f15f2d50741c12dc1fccf424633f-lq)

For now, the externa is immature, but that’s about to change. Up to this point, we’ve only been talking about the females. Meanwhile, the males have not left the cyprid form and are still swimming about.

When males find the female, they latch onto her externa, and like she did to the host, inject their internal cells into the sac. Once inside - get this - they transform into nothing but a few, free-swimming sperm-forming cells. That’s all. This makes them both the simplest males in all the animal kingdom and the most sexually dimorphic creatures in the world.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1e8770c4cac398a2faae4fdd79364a86-lq)

(Human spermatogenic cells, couldn’t find any Rhizocephalan ones)

Now, the now-mature female ejects her eggs into the internal cavity of the bulbous externa. The males - or rather, what was the males - fertilize these eggs and die. The fertilised eggs transform into two morphs: large eggs which will hatch as females and small eggs which will end up as males. When they hatch, the cycle restarts.

* * *

There's one last thing I'd like to mention. To top it all off, the barnacle exerts a sort of mind control on its host. Even if they're males, the crab is somehow tricked into thinking that the externa is its egg sac, and it will care for it like it would its own young. What's more, because they've been castrated, they don't have the hormones which cause them to molt, so the Rhizocephalan is in no danger of falling off.

You win.

Wow! I’m a zoologist and this was new to me - sounds like these things have evolved a life style convergent with some parasitic fungi. Very neat!
```

You know I think of every time I read about a crazy animal or plant like this? I think, somebody made it their fulltime job for 5–7 years to figure out this crazy animals lifecycle, and they got paid and got awards for it, and at the end of the day they wrote a thesis and got a PhD in this crazy ani…

I do wonder what ethical vegans think of some animals' treatment of other animals. This is far from the only beast that is beastly to other beasts. There is a wasp that does something similar to spiders, stinging it immobile then injecting its young to eat it from the inside - or is it the other way…
```

Weirdly, I was reading about Rhizocephalia last night in Bresca’s big invertebrate biology textbook. I wonder if Charles Darwin knew about ‘em. He wrote what was once the definitive tome on barnacles in the years before the Origin of Species—Bresca still lists the book in his bibliography. I leafed…

“Gary Meaney - zoologist, specializes in large predators and terrifying people on Quora with hell-spawned parasites!”

I just pictured the parasite life cycle on a human instead of a crab. Chilling!! Like the xenomorph in Alien but real!
```

```
I used to think that the heart worm had the most improbable lifecycle. Now, I am not so sure. The only reason why I don’t think that you are bullshitting us, is because humans aren’t creative enough to think up this sort of stuff themselves! I can’t imagine who paid for this research! Or how long it t…

Thats a great new alien for sci fi - and its right here on earth already
```

```
Wow. That is beyond bizarre. Thank you!
```

```
What convoluted parasitism!
```

```
This is amazing. All I could do was see the parallel between these guys and viruses. I genuinely think they will become the virus of the eucariotic world, and their evolution will be marked by the most simplistic approach of these species to spread themselves to other creatures. Terrifying… thanks f…

I'm paraphrasing @Jake Williams a bit: I came to Quora because I'm about done it to here with the SCP Foundation, but now I'm going back there.

OK. You win. That is weird.
```

```
Wow. You win. Ugh.
```

Are you saying this thing legitimately turns crabs transsexual!
```

All things bright and beautiful…

This is so fucked up…I like it.
```

Queasy.

Nightmare fuel, thing looks like a facehugger
```

```
Yes, sir!!! That’s one odd little sea thing!
```

```
Yuck!
```

```
Damn, Nature you scary!
```

```
Terrible and interesting. Can humans also become host for this?
```

```
Why do these things even exist? Really speaks to the meaninglessness of the universe if this thing exists only to make more of itself and die. Do they contribute anything to the ecosystem?
```

```
If the female larvae do not eat how do they grow and molt? Did I miss something?
```

```
Scary stuff. A very good candidate for the title, certainly. The mind control part is also seen in the toxoplasmosis parasite, causing rodents to seek out cats who’ll eat them so the parasite can continue to the next stage of its cycle. And certain fungi cause insects to eg crawl up high so the fungu…

The god of evolution does grow bored of beetles every now and then.

This is an excellent model for a horror science fiction story. One part reminded me of Alien because we see the juvenile alien burst out from the crew member and then it disappears only to appear later on as a fully formed adult. What did it eat? It’s like these rhizocephalids.
```

```
Another excellent answer!
```

```
Aspects of this bizarre tale remind me of the lifecycle of the liver fluke. In one of its stages it also ‘takes control’ of the brain of its host and directs it to do something that is essential for the next stage of its cycle. These extreme examples seem to me to stretch the credibility of a simplis…
```

```
Fascinating! Without a digestive system etc. how do the naupilus and cyprid stages gather enough energy and biomass to survive and grow into the next stage in the life cycle?
```

```
One of God’s better jokes. I suppose they attached themselves to the Ark just to make sure.
```

```
Please DO NOT tell me the prickles emanating from the limbs in the photo are a result of the roots inside the host from diagram 1.
```

```
Wow! Fascinating. Sounds like something from a science fiction horror movie!
```

```
Facehugger, much?
```

```
F#*! I am never going to eat Crabs or Shrimp again!
```

```
I can see why Darwin was engrossed with barnacles! I wonder, did he know all this?
```

```
Do the internal roots feed off the crab?

I ask as, though nature is inherently strange, it seems that, if not, the parasite could do the same thing being attached to either nothing or, if so, attaching to even larger species.
```

```
Nature knows no sentimentality
```

```
I’m glad I’m not a crab. Yikes.
```

```
> “simplest male…”

hey you can't talk about me like that!
```

```
Freaky and creepy…thank you for the nightmare juice…and that will be enough interneting for me today..

X_x
```

```
Thank you. I’ve needed new nightmare material.
```

```
All of a sudden, I feel hungry.
