The upper canines of the male babirusa grow upwards, not downwards, erupting out of its skin, and - if they develop enough - curving all the way back to pierce its skull and kill it. By that stage, it’ll already have passed on its genes, so evolution doesn’t care.

Tasmanian devils have evolved a common social habit of biting each other. However, that is the perfect way to transmit Devil Facial Tumour Disease, a transmissable cancer which has scourged the entire species and brought them to the brink of extinction. This is the least heartbreaking picture I could find:

This is the black-tailed antechinus, a small, carnivorous marsupial. During the mating season, males mate so much that they’re left physically exhausted and fatally crippled. The exertion makes their vital organs fail and within weeks scores of males have died.

Because they live exclusively in moist environments and breathe through their skin, almost all species of amphibian are vulnerable to one fatal disease, chytridiomycosis. And it’s taking its toll - global amphibian populations are declining sharply and some have been completely wiped out.

Lastly, human intelligence. Over the course of human evolution, various selective pressures have resulted in us being the most intelligent species on Earth. We have an astounding capability to build complex tools which allow us to live luxurious lives and become veritably invicible. Look how that’s turned out for us.

Evolution has no foresight, and it can often lead species into dead ends, where their adaptations turn on them. Living in a developed country, the devastating effects of our paradoxical “intelligence” you might not yet have felt. But for every slave, Syrian refugee, or victim of global warming-induced flooding and wildfires, they know all about it.

Can you tell me how could the evolution adapting to environmental changes not happened already? The Tasmanian Devils biting is low level agression to decide territorial and mating rights. If you compared this to the lions fight to death behavior, their biting is minuscule. The fact that this injuries…

The Babirusa is not really ‘evolution gone wrong’, from what I hear they have been selected (by people) for their long tusks. Even then, the tusks usually curl so don’t pierce, that is a stray tusk.

As a whole thing, humans still pass on their genes. these things are not pushing towards a new species of humans and are not the result of evolution. Our learning ability that has resulted in many bad things are offset by the characteristic being on the balance a good thing because they have added t…

The babirosa may very well be a result of Fisherian runaway

I dobt know why this doesnt have more upvotes. Awesome answer. My fiance and I talk about the last one a lot. And how things are going to be soooo much worse even in the next 15 years or so… I'm seriously worried about my kids! We do everything we can do to not be apart of all of it, recycle, grow v…

These are really interesting examples. It shows how chaotic nature is.

How about the reproduction cycle of hyenas? Completely without human interference, it's a disaster, but works well enough to pass on the genes…. A designer? Don't think so, unless he was in a particularly bad mood when he invented hyenas….

Wait, what happened with the flood one? How is that our fault?
```

My sympathy goes out to the black-tailed antechinus
```

```
For the antechinus, that’s actually a VERY smart adaptation!! If all the males die off after the breeding season, resources are left to the females and their offspring, therefore increasing the chance of that offspring surviving!
```

```
At least the antechinus dies satisfied.

*nudge nudge*

What you said about the black-tailed antechinus isn’t “bad”. Only for a week or two every year, there is a massive spike in the number of insects (their main food source). It is during this time that they try to have as many babies as they can. The more babies they have, the more chance for their off…

Given a limited, two choice option, between being profoundly stupid/ignorant and happy versus being highly intelligent and unhappy, I would pick the latter EVERY TIME. The ability to understand ourselves, the world we live in, the ability to appreciate the cosmos, as well as love and admire the coura…

Interesting take on things! One thing with man, as many people fail to think about; At NO time in our history as a species; have we lived longer, live more comfortably, live with better health care and less debilitating ailments, live with more security; being attacked by a lion or bear or live with l…

Very nicely presented as always, Gary, But I must my standard little rant on the “I” word: “Intelligence” has no useful meaning. Skill-sets and behaviors are admissible to scientific discussion, But they are niche-related and not fungible. We snoutless apes uniquely occupy a technological niche. That…

Great answer. I’ll might add Megaloceros, a deer in which (apparently) sexual selection produced antlers of crippling size.

Reference to the last picture, genes have different interests than the host individual. Slave trade means a quick radiation of their genes into new habitat. Evolutionary success by definition.
```

```
Humans are not really intelligent as a species. We have language, which enables us to exchange information and develop technology at a fantastic rate. But we do not use it intelligently. Most of us.

Evolution can hardly go “wrong”
```

As for the black-tailed antechinus, what a way to go:)

Adult mayflies cannot eat, only mate. They live only a few hours. Female praying mantises often eat their mates to provide extra energy to form eggs.

Some people supposed intelligence has developed many times over the universe, but it has always resulted in the extinction of the smart beings. On this planet, some of the smartest people realize exactly the pickle we are in but they can’t convinces the masses of the problem.
