There are a handful of possible answers to this question, but for me, the answer is clear: caecilians. Most people have heard of two of the main amphibian groups: the anurans (frogs) and the caudates (salamanders). However, unbeknownst to many, there is a third - and extremely bizarre - group, known as the caecilians.

They‚Äôve popped up in my answers a few time before, but I‚Äôve never written about them in as much detail as they deserve; a predicament which I intend to remedy today.

The nearly 200 species of caecilian are distributed across most of the world‚Äôs tropical rainforests. Their most obvious stand-out feature is, of course, the complete absence of legs - they have an almost earthworm-like appearance. That said, some species can get quite a lot bigger than your typical worm - one specimen was measured to be two metres in length!

All along this length are folds of skin called annuli, another conspicuous hallmark. Though this skin may appear soft and squishy, it hides an embedded armour of subcutaneous scales, which are made of calcite. The skin also has another line of defense: toxic secretions. These can be highly effective - touching the secretions of one species, Boettger‚Äôs caecilian, is known to induce severe hemolysis (rupturing of red blood cells).

Continuing this dermal theme, I am obligated to mention a fascinating behaviour seen in a select handful of caecilian species: maternal dermatophagy, or skin-feeding. When they have newborn young, these animals grow a new, fatty layer of skin, around their existing body.

The babies then start gnawing away at this exceptionally nutritious source of food, which is regenerated every few days. The whole skin-feeding process lasts about a week, during which time the caecilian‚Äôs offspring increase tenfold in size. It may seem grotesque, but it‚Äôs a pretty comparable survival strategy to lactation in mammals.

What‚Äôs more, those aren‚Äôt the only weird caecilian babies. Some members of the family Typhlonectidae are born with a huge set, or sets, of frilly gills sprouting out of their head. Stranger still, the larvae shed them almost instantly after birth, breathing instead with their skin.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b2efcae9c1319a7984dfec7501e280a5-pjlq)

The typhlonectids are a very interesting family for many other reasons. Unlike most of their relatives, which are burrowing creatures, they are aquatic, and many species are entirely restricted to their underwater habitat. They have a long, paddle-like fin running along their tail which allows them to swim in an undulating, eel-like manner.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-eba02ecf39e55c253828569107536b8f-lq)

The most famous of the typhlonectids is probably Atretochoana eiselti, which is notorious for its rather‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ unusual resemblance to something else. What it ought to be known for, on the other hand, is the fact that it it doesn‚Äôt have any lungs!

It‚Äôs unique among caecilians in this regard, and is also the world‚Äôs largest lungless tetrapod by an enormous margin. Its skin is packed to the rafters with blood capillaries, allowing it to breathe and sustain such impressive mass without any complex organ systems.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d5de9ab6cbbc315e26648830d0e5ae62-lq)

While Atretochoana and its relatives sport very dull, greyish, brownish or purplish hues, it‚Äôs worth noting that other caecilians are a lot more vibrant and colourful. They can be bright yellow:

Orange:

Or electric blue:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-11e438920df5989676b871b051adca92-lq)

These palettes are likely an example of aposematism: bright colours which advertise to would-be predators that the animal is poisonous, venomous, unpalatable, spiny or otherwise undesirable. They are not - as far as we know - a sexual display feature meant for other caecilians, because these creatures are practically blind.

Caecilian eyes are quite primitive, capable only of distinguishing between light and dark, not of forming images. They are burrowing animals, after all, and good vision is not much of an advantage for this lifestyle. Hence, the eyes are tiny, sometimes even completely covered by skin.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-537d2bde3255a28dc74ebf81cba069b3-pjlq)

That being said, caecilians have other, much more acute sensory organs - the most bizarre of which being their tentacles. Yes, just behind the nostrils, they have a pair of minuscule tendrils, only perceptible if you look closely. Their precise mechanism is not really known, but it‚Äôs reasonable to assume that they are used to smell things, perhaps augmenting the regular olfactory system.

The tentacle in the photo below is that pale, tooth-like projection, if you‚Äôre having trouble spotting it.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0523e4b2f6eb8aaf1ea1bfc2d77be45d-lq)

Below the tentacles is, of course, the mouth, which has plenty of weird stuff going on. Caecilian teeth are translucent, frighteningly sharp, and often arranged in multiple rows, adapted for chomping through their earthworm prey. Furthermore, there is a species - the ringed caecilian - has a set of glands in its dentition which may in fact secret venom! This would make it the world‚Äôs only known venomous amphibian.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b825f5dab0fd92ef8e10179712464c6-lq)

What‚Äôs even more interesting to me than their teeth, however, is how they bite with them. The musculature surrounding the caecilian jaw is extraordinarily complex, containing muscles which have not been found in any other organism on Earth. This is because, unlike all other vertebrate species, they have two separate systems of muscles used for closing the jaw.

In addition to the normal set of jaw muscles, which simply contract to pull the mandible bone upwards, they have a second array which push down on the posterior section of the bone, causing the front part to lift up in a seesaw-like motion. It‚Äôs one of those biological quirks which probably doesn‚Äôt interest the average person but is fascinating to people like me.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-91fec332ac57fb9972c6cbb1fecbee27-pjlq)

In case you‚Äôre wondering, this intricate feature is an adaptation which allows caecilians to bite with greater force, especially in a gaping position in which the jaw muscles would otherwise be at much less of a mechanical advantage.

Now, I finally have an answer which does this wonderfully peculiar group of amphibians justice. Thank you very much everyone for reading; I hope you found some of this interesting, and that you all have a great day.

Would you say this is an example of convergent evolution, producing a snake like creature from a different family to the reptiles?

I have only heard you mention these creatures briefly before. Otherwise, I know nothing about them whatsoever.

Thanks so much for the post. You had said before that you were going to write about caecilians which I have been waiting for it enthusiastically. The skin feeding also exists in discus fish.

Thank you for a very interesting answer. It is partly for intelligent answers like these that I stay on Quora.

Are newts more closely related to salamanders, or frogs?
```

```
Another fascinating answer Gary. One question if you don't mind. What makes them amphibians? They are so odd I would have thought they would be in their own phylum (if amphibian is a phylum and not some other taxonomic classification)?
```

```
Fascinating. You‚Äôve proven me correct when I told my eight grade science teacher that there was another group of amphibians. Thank you.
```

```
Thanks for this amazing answer. This kind of high quality content is the reason I joined Quora. Looking forward to read more from you!
```

```
Brilliant answer about a group of species I was only dimly aware of before just now. Thank you for a fascinating read.
```

```
Never heard of this group. It is amazing the diversity we find in strange creatures - each one with unique characteristic - still based on the same chemistry, and apparently one single ancestor‚Ä¶.
```

```
Horrifyingly fascinating. That first picture of the ringed caecilian looks just like the xenomorph from Alien.
```

```
Once again, Quora rocks. Thanks for a clear and engaging posting.
```

```
As always, your answer was fascinating, accompanied by striking photos. This essay in particular got me to thinking about how amazing it is that we‚Äôve catalogued these creatures. My assumption is that most of the data in this answer wasn‚Äôt available as recently as a century ago.

I‚Äôm nearly 100% sure the Alaskan bull worm in Spongebob is inspired by caecilians.
```

```
So happy I discovered your posts. They are fascinating and I learn. The comparison to lactation was excellent.

Thank you, Gary. I read about these creatures as a child but knew very little about them. It‚Äôs good to see them, um, fleshed out nicely.
```

```
Amazing creatures and wonderful text. I just learned something new today. Thank you.

Absolutely amazing answer! I definitely knew about them before, but still learned many new things from reading this! Thank you for this!
```

‚ÄúThis would make it the world‚Äôs only known venomous amphibian.‚Äù OK, if I remember my terminology (40 years since I sat in a classroom) venomous bites you and you bite poisonous? So, those ‚Äúpoison dart‚Äù frogs‚Äô existence doesn‚Äôt change your statement, am I correct?
```

```
Absolutely fascinating and I knew exactly nothing about them before now. That‚Äôs my learning experience for today together with identifying a Lesser Yellowlegs.
```

```
You‚Äôve done it again, Gary, thank you SO much for yet another amazing subject I had no idea about.
```

```
Fascinating. I had no idea they were so colourful, or had such an interesting jaw structure. Keep up your posts.
```

One of the most bizarre animals I've ever heard of, cheers.

What you chose to include in your response and your style of writing made these creatures even more interesting.

Love it, best quora post i have read this month.

Back in the 90's I had two "rubber eels" (as they were called by the fish store) in my aquarium. We thought their little heads looked like sock puppets. Apparently, they were plentiful in the pet trade then, but almost impossible to get now. They were really fun to watch.

Looks exactly like the ‚Äúchest-burster‚Äù from ‚ÄúAlien‚Äù.

Fascinating, thank you for the wonderful read.

Very interesting, what‚Äôs the habitat for these critters?
```

```
What do they eat with those horrifying teeth?
```

Where do these things live, mostly? What temperatures do they like, mostly?
```

```
Thank you very much for this post. I had no idea these things existed and I‚Äôm now fascinated by them. And I‚Äôd love me one of them blue ones.
```

```
Wow, that is some interesting! That tops the list for today‚Äôs ‚Äúlearn something new every day‚Äù. There is so much real knowledge to acquire, I am happy to have found this.
```

```
I feel like Xenomorphs were inspired by these things.
```

```
I upvoted this because of the effort you put into it, not because of the nasty wormlike Is amphibians
```

```
Simply fascinating - thanks for the details. I wonder if some species of snakes have not independently evolved similar jaw muscles.
```

```
Thanks for a illuminating post
```

```
This is really neat. Thank you for the post.

I found all of this interesting! Amazing answer.

Fantastic answer Gary. That Typhlonectidae youngster puts me in mind of Axototl, another rarely known creature (with some equally alien features).
```

```
Welp, time to never go to the rainforest.
```

```
Do you suppose that the caecilians inspired the sandworms in Frank Herbert‚Äôs ‚ÄúDune,‚Äù which could be ridden by holding open the annuli so that the worm wouldn‚Äôt dive beneath the surface?

They are amazing‚Ä¶ and scary!

Those gills remind me of an axolotl
