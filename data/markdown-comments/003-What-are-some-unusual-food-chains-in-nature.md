One of the most iconic animals which inhabits the dry grasslands of Southern Brazil is the maned wolf, Chrysocyon brachyurus. Of all the extant dogs, the maned wolf is perhaps the most herbivorous.

In fact, the majority of its diet is made up of plant matter. It is from the plants it eats that it gets the chemical pyrazine, which tends to make its urine smell like cannabis (which once set police in Rotterdam on the hunt for illegal smokers).

Of all the flora it eats, it seems that one kind is its favourite - the so-called “wolf apple”, or fruta-do-lobo. It is in truth not an apple, but a sort of cross between a tomato and an eggplant, and up to half of a maned wolf’s diet can be solely wolf apples.

Incidentally, it is thought that is partially because the tannin-rich fruits kill infectious giant kidney worms, which could otherwise kill the animal.

Don’t worry, I’m getting to the point soon.

For unknown reasons, when maned wolves defecate, they usually do so directly onto the nests of leafcutter ants. While this may seem rude, this is actually very valuable for the ants, for they cultivate fungus gardens.

Fungi, as you probably know, like to grow on animal feces, so the leafcutters transport the dung into their underground nests. However, before they feed it to their cultivars, they take out the wolf apple seeds and leave them in special refuse piles.

Amidst all the ants’ organic waste - which is an excellent fertilizer - the seeds germinate, creating more wolf apple plants for the maned wolves to eat. Thus, the cycle repeats - and it’s almost, but not quite, as if the canines, and not only the ants, have their own form of agriculture.

How very lovely! But where do the kidney worms come from?
```

I have heard of people keeping exotic animals as pets but would its specialized diet of wolf apples mean people feed them alternatives thereby inviting the parasites or is that a matter of vaccinations/habitat?
```

```
And what is the purpose of such adorably long legs?
```

```
So interesting! I love your answers - like mini written David Attenborough documentaries. :)
```

This is so beautiful ! Thank you

This is one of my favorite canids.

Wonders of nature never cease astonish.

It appears impossible for best human minds to even touch the fringes of the mechanics of evolution.

I love how this answer sounds like absolute tosh but it isn’t.
```

```
Congrats! I am Brazilian, love nature, have seen maned wolves in nature, knew about the apple stuff but never heard about the deffecation impact. Wow!
```

```
The fruit smells delicious but the taste is horrible. I tried them many times. I do not even think they are edible for humans.
```

```
I had no idea of this. Now I do. You even manged to tie the knot by explaining what the wolf got from defecating on the ants nest. Lovely.
```

```
Fascinating. Thank you for the clearly written post.
```

```
Fascinating! Keeping any exotic animals for pets, is beyond cruel! It’s disgusting and monumentally selfish.
```

```
This is why I love Quora. Thank you for this amazing answer!
```

```
Oh that was interesting to learn! Thank you!
```

```
Neat!
```

```
Simply great!! I wonder had I not been on Quota, how the hell would I have got this mind-blowing fact known.

Thank you! Thanks Quora!
```

```
Lobo-guará! It’s truly an amazing animal.
```

```
Mind blown!

Faith in Quora restored!!
```

```
Interesting!!!
```

```
The most shocking point of this post is the Rotterdam police seeking for pot smokers. I know Rotterdam is not Amsterdam, but even so…
```

```
very interesting. however, the Lobo Guará inhabits the dry grasslands of central Brasil, a savannah type of ecosystem called CERRADO. As can be seen on this map, the Lobo Guará barely inhabits the 3 southernmost Brazilian states. The distinction seems small, but the southern region of Brazil has an ar…

Which brings me to ask — how was maned wolf urine finding itself in Rotterdam in enough quantity to confuse the police? But yes, nature is amazing. Wonder if the wolf apple would be tasty to humans? I hope not. Humans then, would take them all away from the maned wolves.
```

```
The canine in Rotterdam… Did it escape from a zoo, from an illegal private owner or it did not escape at all but was smelled to its forced habitat? (I aint the OP)
```

```
Gary, you never disappoint!

I rushed over to Google for my answer and the Maned Wolf is a true omnivore. See below (copied from Animal Diversity Web): The maned wolf is omnivorous. It eats armadillos, rabbits, rodents and other small mammals, fish, birds, bird eggs, reptiles, gastropods and other terrestrial mollusks, insects,…

So, these ants grow wolf-shit by dumping wolf-apple seeds. It’s kinda like how humans could grow wolf-apples by dumping wolf-shit.
```

```
God works at it’s best! WE should learn from them. Instead of destroying the planet.
```

```
It really looks like a vegan wolf…
```

```
Some member of that wolf pack deserves a “Lob-el Prize”!
```

```
What is the relation between ant and fungus? Why do the ants cultivate fungus?
```

```
Wait, so the leafcutters are domesticating these maned wolves. Also, this reminds me of how humans produce Kopi Luwak.
