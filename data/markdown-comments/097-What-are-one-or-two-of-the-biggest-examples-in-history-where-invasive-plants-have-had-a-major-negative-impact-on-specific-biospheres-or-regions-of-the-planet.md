Perhaps the most infamous and iconic instance of plant invasion would be that of kudzu \- the “Vine that Ate the South”. Kudzu is a Japanese vine which was introduced to the United States in 1876 for a Japan-themed exposition and subsequently gained rapid abundance throughout the Southern US.

Kudzu’s transformative and destructive capacity is legendary. It is said to smother entire forests and starve the native trees of sunlight. The effect it has on leaf litter reduces the soil’s carbon content by over a quarter.

Those are all true facts… that being said, kudzu isn’t the apocalyptic, all-consuming megalomaniac which it’s often construed as. While you’ll often see claims that it shrouds nearly 30,000 square kilometres and expands by 600 square km a year, these figures are likely false, first published by a random gardening magazine.

In truth, there are less than 1,000 square kilometres of kudzu in the USA, in contrast to the much more voracious but obscure Japanese honeysuckle, pictured below, which has conquered some 45,000 square kilometres of America.

So, ultimately, the biggest danger of kudzu to conservation is not the plant itself, but the manner in which it has robbed much more problematic invaders of our attention. It’s far from the only time the media has exaggerated the danger of an invasive species - the recent absurd panic over so-called “murder hornets” being an extreme example.

Perhaps a much more fitting antagonist of the plant world would be the water hyacinth, a floating aquatic flower native to the Amazon rainforest. The facts and figures of this species are much, much more worrying.

The water hyacinth is one of the fastest-growing plants on Earth. Via runners, it’s capable of growing up to 5 metres in a single day, forming thick mats which can double their size in a week or two. In fact, over a three-week period, the population of a given hyacinth community can multiply a hundredfold.

The species has found its way to lakes, lagoons, swamps, ponds and reservoirs across all six of the world’s inhabited continents, from Florida to Kenya to New Zealand. When mats of water hyacinth choke waterways, the surface level may rise by as much as a metre, and the organisms beneath the surface are severely deprived of light and oxygen.

Furthermore, they encourage the propagation of certain bugs which carry lethal diseases, such as mosquitoes and aquatic snails.

Thankfully for us, water hyacinth won’t bring an ecological apocalypse to the world. When effectively controlled, it poses little threat, and can even be beneficial to the ecosystem in small doses.

As a bonus fun fact: In 1910, a detailed plan to introduce hippos to the USA as ranch animals to simultaneously curb the spread of the water hyacinth and solve the meat crisis at the time.

Here in Norway we have trouble with asian knotweed on land and water-milfoil in lowland lakes, but the invasive plant that gets all the press is persian hogweed.
```

```
Here in India, people have taken to making handicrafts from water hyacinth as a way to combat it.
```

```
Could kudzu or water hyacinth be used to produce biofuels?
```

```
Hippos you could eat after they were done helping us out? Wonder why that plan went nowhere…
```

```
Don’t forget Chinese privet and nandina. They are taking over the Southeastern understory.

Can't help but think of Vietnam post war and the effects it had in their landscape.

I wonder how does hippo meat taste?. Something suggests it could be delicious.
