Acacia trees like defense mechanisms so much, they evolved a defense mechanism from a different defense mechanism.

Acacias are covered in thorns, which of course make them difficult for herbivores to eat. Although some animals, such as giraffes, have extra-long tongues and prehensile lips to negotiate the spikes, overall they’re quite effective.

However, many species in the Acacia genus have gone a step further, and evolved hollow passages - known as domatia - in their thorns. These tunnels are the perfect place for an ant colony to set up shop - and that’s exactly what the trees want.

While insignificant to us, in the insect worlds, ants are bad news. Using ridiculous numbers, as well as biting mandibles and formic acid secretions, to overwhelm virtually any target, many species of ant are, on an invertebrate scale, the ultimate predators.

So, when they colonize the thorns of the acacia trees, any tresspasser in the area will either be killed by the ants or driven away by them. This includes all the pesky herbivorous insects which gnaw away at the acacia leaves. Essentially, the ants become the tree’s own suite of security guards.

It’s not only the domatia that the plants offer to their six-legged tenants. Many species of acacia also have these little buds on the tip of each leaf. These are known as Beltian bodies (above) and are in fact high-protein snacks for the ants.

A handful of species, such as A. colinsii, also produce another form of ant food - extrafloral nectar. This sugary secretion is not - as nectar usually is - found in the flower, but instead simply secreted from the body of the plant. All in all, the ants get accomodation and free meals, and the trees get an army of defenders. Seems like a pretty good deal to me.

That's awesome! Nature is so fascinatingly cool. This is 110% why I follow you, Gary!

This reminds me of the science fiction story The Author of the Acacia Seeds, Ursula K. Le Guin. The premise was (if I remember correctly) that a scientist found some acacia seeds that had been marked by ants in the distant past - they were able to decode the markings and realized that it was a sort…

Reminds me of a story about some plants on an island. They used “ant squad” protection to keep herbivores from eating the plants, which worked well for the ecology of the island because the plants held the soil (from being washed away). All very nice ecologically. Then one day the ants discovered a…

What an amazing design!

Makes me wonder how many ants a giraffe inadvertantly eats on a typical day.

As an Acacia, I approve this message. We are all thorny, defensive, and swarming with ants.
```

Could humans eat Beltian Bodies?
```

Very interesting. Domatia, a Greek word that means “rooms”
```

Symbiosis at it's finest.

No one who has been bitten by a fire ant in between their toes will ever think of ants as insignificant.

Lovely example of symbiotic evolution.

This is, of course, until army ants come along and ruin everything.
```

```
Is that the same as honeydew?
```

```
What about the leaf eating ants? How they stop them?
```

Fascinating. Evolution is more clever than any diety.

Super mutual!
