The world’s deepest and most voluminous lakes form when water gathers in tectonic rifts: the immense volcanic chasms found wherever the Earth’s crust is pulling apart. These rift valley lakes are also the world’s most ancient, as the gorges they fill remain geologically stable for millions of years.

No freshwater lake is deeper, older or more voluminous than Siberia’s Lake Baikal, an unfathomably huge body of water that lies along the rift between the Eurasian and Amurian tectonic plates. I’ve already written about this place and its wildlife five times in previous answers, and for good reason - it contains one of the most fascinating ecosystems on Earth.

As the world’s seventh-largest lake by surface area, Baikal might not seem so gargantuan at first glance. It owes its size to what lies beneath: its staggering maximum depth of over 1.6 kilometres! The chart below is an almost sobering illustration of this plunge.

If it were emptied of all its water, you could pour all five Great Lakes of North America into the abyss and still not fill it all the way up to its 23,600 cubic kilometre capacity. In fact, Lake Baikal alone is home to nearly a quarter of the Earth’s fresh water, excluding that found deep underground.

Anyways, let’s get to the real subject of this answer: animals. Lake Baikal is essentially the ideal environment for freakish otherworldly creatures to evolve - it ticks all the boxes. It’s super isolated, found smack-dab in the middle of Asia. It’s been stable for a very long time, being around 30 million years old. It’s got extreme conditions, with brutally cold temperatures and a two meter thick sheet of ice covering it in the winter.

Sure enough, Baikal has produced many species which are neither found anywhere else in the world nor resemble anything else in the world. For example, the lake is home to an incredible ten endemic families of amphipod crustaceans, which together comprise a total of more than 360 species. The strangest and most alien family of these is surely Acanthogammaridae.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bc111054addc6d3a1829e3e5a777cbc8-lq)

The 159 species of acanthogammarids that dwell in the gloomy depths of Baikal would look more at home in the methane oceans of Titan than on Earth. Due to the lake’s water being exceptionally rich in oxygen, some of them have grown to dwarf their close relatives elsewhere. Whereas most amphipods are practically microscopic, the acanthogammarid pictured above can grow up to seven centimetres in length. It’s an apex predator in the murky depths.

One could spend a lifetime studying the unique amphipods that dwell in Lake Baikal. Instead, I’ll give you a whirlwind tour of some of the coolest ones. There’s Macrohectopus branickii, a ghostly-looking filter-feeder which wanders the lake’s pelagic zone:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-06a35159c55de735342c4c88c5ded0c6-lq)

Abyssogammarus, an orange, thorny creature which can be found crawling around the very deepest regions of the lakebed:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9b8cd44447c30b1e94cd2ca8931806dc-lq)

Micruropus, a positively minuscule little guy who grazes upon phytoplankton:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-a57eab87e14304f69a6ba8a7e861a791-lq)

And many, many more…

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-402b530807ffa58b2f8fbe385a5adb56-lq)

There is such vast diversity among the amphipods of the lake, and yet as a whole they only make up a fraction of Baikal’s total biodiversity. The most abundant creature of all here is actually an endemic species of copepod called Epischura baikalensis. It’s diminutive in size, measuring a couple of millimetres in length, but so incredibly numerous that it accounts for as much as 90% of Lake Baikal’s total biomass!

E. baikalensis are filter-feeders, floating aimlessly through the depths to passively gather tiny morsels of food. It is estimated that they sift through around a thousand cubic kilometres of water every year. They are so efficacious in this process that they keep the waters remarkably clean - because of them, Lake Baikal is one of the clearest lakes on Earth.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1b5fc69ba52b9c27e405dfc2e2fafe1a-lq)

Another unusual group of animals which is copious in Baikal is the sponge family Lubomirskiidae. This taxon is endemic, so the 16 species it contains are not found anywhere else in the world. They all harbour a symbiotic community of dinoflagellates, single-celled algae which use photosynthesis to feed their spongy hosts.

These dinoflagellates give lubomirskiids an unmistakeable luminous green colour, so the areas in which they abound look like verdant underwater forests and meadows. Most of the sponges have a flattened, carpet-like shape, but some species are tall and branching in form.

Now, after briefly discussing some of the lake’s most interesting invertebrates, I ought to introduce a handful of its unique vertebrates. Lets start with fish. There are two whole families of fish which are only found in Lake Baikal, as well as one which is almost exclusive to it. The first of the two unique groups is Abyssocottidae, also known as the deep-water sculpins.

The 24 species of abyssocottids are the world’s deepest-living freshwater fish, together with the next species I’m going to mention. They can be found even in the darkest bowels of the lake, 1.6 kilometres below the surface, where they must withstand an absolutely crushing 16 million pascals of pressure.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-060e218ced16d00100553f4de4f85342-lq)

Believe it or not, the other fish family is far, far stranger. Known as Comephoridae, it contains just two species in one genus. These fish are more commonly referred to as the golomyankas, or Baikal oilfish, and they’re the most bizarre and interesting freshwater fish in the world.

Baikal oilfish get their name from the fact that 40% of their weight consists of fatty oils, which they use to regulate their buoyancy - unlike most fish, they lack swim bladders. Scales, pigmentation, pelvic fins, and cone cells in the eyes are also completely absent. During the day, golomyankas inhabit the very deepest regions of the lake, before ascending all the way to the surface at night, if it’s cold enough.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c9f0266305c23efaf42c5a7e3bf5aa47-lq)

They are highly abundant, accounting for over two thirds of the fish in the lake, with a total estimated biomass of 150,000 tonnes. However, the vast majority of this population is female - curiously, as little as 17% of big Baikal oilfish are male. The females do not lay eggs, but instead give live birth, producing up to 3,000 babies in one go! The birthing process invariably kills the mother.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-33de7ea623fb837b013b7e4fd5b02d35-lq)

Golomyankas are a dietary staple of Lake Baikal’s most famous native animal - the spectacularly spherical Baikal seal, or nerpa. It’s the world’s only species of seal that lives exclusively in a freshwater environment, and also the smallest of the seals, at around only one metre in length.

How a marine mammal managed to find its way into a lake 1.5 thousand kilometres from the sea is quite the mystery. The prevailing hypothesis is that, during the last Ice Age, they migrated to Baikal from the Arctic via a huge system of Siberian lakes and rivers which were created by the glaciers. I wrote about this enigma in detail in [this answer](https://www.quora.com/How-did-a-population-of-landlocked-seals-manage-to-establish-itself-in-Lake-Baikal-of-all-places-at-an-altitude-of-450-m-and-several-hundred-kilometers-from-the-Nearest-coastline/answer/Gary-Meaney "www.quora.com").

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-984c7cf79f60e397769dcbf1fb7aa02f-lq)

I suppose the nerpa doesn’t really fit the parameters of your question, seen as it doesn’t dwell in the deepest parts of the lake, but you can’t write an answer about Lake Baikal without mentioning the Baikal seal. They can still travel to impressive depths of up to 400 metres, and hold their breath for more than an hour. They get this ability from the huge volume of blood they carry - several litres in excess of what would be expected for seals of their size!

As said, the vast majority of what Baikal seals eat are golomyankas, although they also dine on a variety of other fish and crustaceans. One very interesting dietary habit they have is the eating of Kessler’s sculpin, a fish that nestles in the silty lakebed. The grit and sediment inside these sculpins scrapes the seals’ digestive systems clean of parasites.

So, thank you very much for reading my summary of the most remarkable and outlandish wildlife that one can find in the Siberian abyss that is Lake Baikal. If you celebrate, I hope you have a very happy Christmas, and if you don’t, I hope you have a fantastic day nonetheless.

Thank you for the fascinating article. This is about as close as we’ll come to a “lost” world, and it is still goes back only about half as many years as the end of the last dinosaur era. How does the life in Lake Baikal compare to what they’ve seen so far in Antarctica’s Lake Vostok?
```

How do golomyankas equalise the water pressure as they go up and down?
```

```
I am fascinated by what we could (if any) eventually find inside Vostok Lake in Antarctica.

What joy to read! Thanks very much for the fabulous blast of information.
```

This lake is amazing for many other reasons. For example: many-many rivers bring water to it but only one (Angara) is draining it. The ice so clear you can see all through it. There is a fish that freezes with ice in winter and comes back to life with spring. And many more I don’t know about. Truly…

As always, a well-researched and well-written post! One question though regarding the Baikal seal: is it truly the only freshwater seal? I was under the impression that there are freshwater seals in Lake Ladoga in Russia, and in Lake Saimaa in Finland (and, incidentally the Finnish name for the latte…
```

```
In 2017 it was reported that “Russia's Lake Baikal, the world's deepest freshwater lake, has extremely high pollution levels, President Vladimir Putin warned…”. Do you know if this has had much effect on the biodiversity of the lake?
```

```
Absolutely fascinated by your article. Having no previous knowledge of this lake, now hope to know more. Wondered what scientists use to explore the depths and assume high pressure capable submarines or robotics. What can you tell us about that?
```

```
Merry Christmas to you as well and thank you for your Christmas gift of knowledge. :) I always love learning new things and found this very interesting!
```

```
I would expect this lake to be the focus of much scientific research!
```

```
This one, as all your answers I’ve read, give me a feeling of guilt, when I remember I used to teach Invert Zool for several years in the ‘80s, thinking I mastered the specialty, which I clearly didn’t. If I consider the amount of knowledge you exhibit compared to my own, probably ca. 50–60% is new.…

It was a sincere pleasure to read this post.

Thank you.

Do oilfish have any adaptations that let them surface so quickly without risk of “the bends” or something similar? Or is that a threat only to air-breathers?
