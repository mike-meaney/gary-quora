## The Horrifying World of Birds with Teeth

In a way, yes. One of the many adaptations raptors have to help them in their carnivorous lifestyle is a pair of structures known as tomial teeth. These are little pointed serrations on the tomium - that is, the cutting edge of the beak.

Interestingly enough, it‚Äôs not just birds of prey which have these cutting fangs. You may have heard of a family of macabre little birds known as the shrikes‚Ä¶

They belong to the most diverse bird order; the passerines, or perching birds. Your typical passerine would be a plump little feathered friend which eats seeds, worms and insects - think robins, sparrows, finches and the like. Not shrikes.

They‚Äôve evolved into carnivores, and are infamous for impaling their prey on natural spikes (as seen above) as a means of caching the food for later. When they do eat the victims, they do it with their strong, hooked beak - and their tomial teeth.

There are other kinds of toothy birds, however. Members of the Anatidae family, such as ducks and geese, have comb-like structures called pectens lining the inside of their bill, which are used to strain food from water. Kudos to geese for going the extra horrifying mile and slapping some pectens on their tongues.

(This is one of the numerous reasons why you shouldn‚Äôt ever kiss a goose.)

Then there‚Äôs another type of structure, similar to the pecten: the papilla, found in a variety of birds. Penguins, for example, possess lingual papillae; rows of spines on their tongue which help dice up fish.

A more widespread version of these would be choanal papillae, found on the palate of many a bird. These are triangular, backwards-facing structures which line the two sides of what‚Äôs known as the choanal slit.

So, there‚Äôs a smorgasbord of vaguely fang-like bits and bobs which lurk in the mouths of avians. Thank you for reading eight paragraphs of me ruining birds you thought were cute, and have a nice day.

Wow! And how do the shrikes get their prey on the spikes? With their beaks?

The goose is a bird to be reckoned with. They are afraid of nothing!

I guess Lorikeets fall into the specialist tongue papillae category, if not quite like fangs, I'd still advise against kissing one‚Ä¶!

P.S. Shrikes rock!!!
