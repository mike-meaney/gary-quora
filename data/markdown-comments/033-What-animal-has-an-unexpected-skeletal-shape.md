Surprisingly, I‚Äôd have to go with frogs. They might seem boring at a glance, but frogs are one of the weirdest land vertebrate groups there are - thanks in part to their insane reproductive biology, but also due to their skeletons.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b01691467192ba5e9c426228af6f33bd-lq)

First of all, there‚Äôs the fact that their skeletons have been drastically ‚Äúsimplified‚Äù. Most of the components of the skull have fused together into a single structure called the frontoparietal, and the spine may contain as little as five vertebrae. No species has more than nine.

Frogs have also discarded all the teeth on the lower jaw - except for one species, actually. Incredibly, Guenther‚Äôs marsupial frog from South America seems to have completely re-evolved lower teeth, unlike any other frog. Also, females have an egg pouch on their back, hence ‚Äúmarsupial‚Äù:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-51f6ab65957451ae702301d332eb8385-pjlq)

A different, related species of marsupial frog is pictured above, but it‚Äôs the same concept. Oh yeah, their eggs are also the largest of any amphibians, and the babies skip the tadpole phase. Didn‚Äôt I tell you frogs were really weird?

Alas, I‚Äôm getting sidetracked - back to the skeleton. The ribs of frogs have been reduced to stubs, called ‚Äútransverse processes‚Äù, or have disappeared altogether in some species. One hypothesis is that this is due to the way they move - by hopping on their belly. Repeatedly landing on their ribs would be damaging to the bones.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6b7168bdb64f2fbe0997b734e574e2e0-lq)

So, because their ribs are so tiny, frogs can‚Äôt breathe by expanding and contracting the chest, like other vertebrates. Instead, they respire by pumping their throats, as the inside of their mouth is lined with capillary blood vessels for gas exchange. They also breathe partially through their skin.

Other examples of the frog skeleton being ‚Äúsimplified‚Äù include the forelegs and shoulder girdle, which are each fused amalgamations of smaller bones. The pelvis bone is also really, really weird; it has this bizarre trident shape, and it‚Äôs longer than the entire spine!

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-57bad56766e07f295231319599106627-pjlq)

Another really odd thing is that that stick of bone in the middle of the ‚Äútrident‚Äù, the urostyle, is actually what‚Äôs left of a tail. Based on studies of embryos, the tail vertebrae of frogs‚Äô ancestors have slowly retracted and been absorbed into the bony sheath of the spine.

Lastly, I‚Äôll talk about the hands and feet. Each frog forelimb has four digits, but in the males of many species, there appears to be five. This fifth ‚Äútoe‚Äù is a mysterious, spike-like structure called the prepollex, or pseudothumb. It‚Äôs usually used either in combat or to grip females during mating.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-245eac0b931030e660e0f1b3a914f698-pjlq)

Also, you can‚Äôt mention froggy toes without giving the hairy frog a shoutout. Nicknamed the Wolverine frog, this unique species from the rainforests of Central Africa is famous for its amazing defense mechanism.

When threatened, the hairy frog can snap its toe bones at will. The jagged shards jut out through the skin, and can be used to maim attackers. Of course, the species is even more well-known for its ‚Äúhair‚Äù; filaments of skin, or dermal papillae, which sprout along the flanks of males during the breeding season.

Alas, I‚Äôd better finish up now before I find myself fallen into another info-dump rabbit hole - or should I say ribbit hole? In fact, writing that painful joke made me want to go on another tangent about how only one species of frog (the Pacific tree frog) actually says ‚Äúribbit‚Äù and it became the stereotypical frog noise because that species lives near Hollywood, California.

See what I mean? Anyway, thanks everyone for reading. I hope you aren‚Äôt too bored by me talking at length about the bones of amphibians. Have a great day!

I spent many of my formative years in Southern California, not far from LA. While I don't recall whether I heard frogs there or not--I think I did--I do recall going to Ohio to visit my dad over the summers and being terrified of the creaky croaky choky noises that surrounded the family pond. I didn'‚Ä¶

Oh, my god, excellent answer! I think the only thing I already knew about is the toe switchblade, and I‚Äôm guessing I knew from you!

An answer like this reminds me of the Quora of old.

Very good indeed.
```

```
Thanks! I collect skulls (as a hobby! a hobby!) and I was considering buying a frog skeleton for my collection but it looked so simplified and weird looking I assumed somebody had botched the mounting. Lesson learned!
```

I wonder why so many high school biology courses have frog dissection, given that frogs are so different.
```

```
There seems to be an extra double leg bone too, i.e. a double femur before the tibia and fibula?
```

```
Wait, there‚Äôs a frog with wolverine claws AND wolverine sideburns? sick! That‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve learned in quite some time!

Couldn't stop reading, ribbiting answer!

One suggestion for ya;

Frogs are common in most places, so people take for granted how incredibly bizarre they are. If someone discovered such an animal, say a cat that starts its life as a chipmunk, no one would believe it.

One summer I was visiting friends in northern Germany. About 50 yards from my window where I was sleeping was a pond. It was mating season and at night the frogs shouted dry, raspy, murderous declarations that sounded so evil, I was completely creeped out and had to shut the window in my room and in‚Ä¶

Your mention of the Pacific tree frog reminds me of one summer when I was visiting my grandparents. One enterprising young neighbor had a thriving business selling tree frogs to all the other children. It was a scam, though, because the frogs would escape and make it back to their original tree, and‚Ä¶

No keep going. I love when you go into tangents and i especially enjoyed reading about our friend, the frog. Do hairy frogs survive maiming themselves in defense of themselves? Please write one article per day if you can with dinosaur Fridays if possible.

RIBBIT HOLE?

Shame on you. Face with a chance to end cleanly, you got caught up in the frog of more.

Yes, I live next to a swamp in NW Washington State. For the past two months it‚Äôs been ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit, ribbit‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶all night long.

Thanks, that was really fascinating.

Fascinating! I love going down biological rabbit holes

I respect the seriously in depth frog knowledge. I even learned a few things. Wow, a real zoologist, no wonder!
```

Great informative read! I get leopard frogs every year in my pond. My 17 year old calico koi fish discovered tadpoles a couple of years ago. He nearly doubled his size the first year he ate tadpoles. I had to ask myself if tadpoles have some kind of growth hormone that caused the fish to get bigger‚Ä¶

I just found this so incredible and fascinating. Excellent!

Thanks for this interesting information. Your discussion of Guenther‚Äôs Marsupial Frog reminded me of a frog I saw here this summer, which coincidentally is called simply Guenther‚Äôs Frog. I saw what resembles teeth, but must me markings around the mouth, otherwise ‚Ä¶.. That made me go looking up whethe‚Ä¶

Now you‚Äôve got me curious about toads. Are any of these traits shared with toads?

Fascinating

My pond has hundreds of tadpoles at the moment

Hopefully some will make it to frog before being eaten by the fish.

Why I still read Quora: answers like this. Such a nice change from the ESL bots and racist BS.

Great insight. Long time since I studied zoology and have forgotten about frogs' skeletal weirdness. Keep it up and thank you.

I love the frogs behind my house, there's a fairly extensive swamp/wetlands area back there and the frogs are plentiful (turtles too, eastern sliders and bog turtle). Some even make their way up to the house on occasion, and they're so loud on warm summer nights that you can barely hear to have a co‚Ä¶

Keep talking!

That was simply beautiful! I'm all choked up!!!

Nevermind.

Frog in the throat.

Far far from bored!

Superb answer! Well written and illustrated. Had no idea. Thank you.

What does the frog say?
Not ribbit‚Ä¶

That frog looks like the Hawk spaceships from Space:1999 (1975‚Äì76)‚Ä¶!

I never seem to read a boring thing about frogs.

Loved this. Frogs are fascinating

Also delicious!

Incredible! Never knew any one of these!

That‚Äôs amazing!! Frogs are truly weird!!! üê∏

Well, because I enjoyed your froggy post, I‚Äôll give you some froggy jokes to enjoy. Q. How deep can you pile frogs in a shoebox? A. Three deep! Three deep! Q.

Hate to be the ‚Äúincorrect information‚Äù person, but humans have 33 vertebrae.
```

I believe there are sloths discovered with up to 10 vertebrae.

Very cool answer and photos! üòçüòç

Another thing about froggy bones is how much a frog‚Äôs skeleton resembles a human one, in its overall design.
```

By all means, do go on and on. I love it!

I would upvote multiple times if possible. You, sir, are the the hope of MQGA (make Quora great again).

Exotic tidbits and oddities notwithstanding, i see no reason to claim the overall look of frog skeletons is ‚Äúunexpected‚Äù.

Every frog skeleton you pictured looks exactly like a frog to me‚Ä¶ moreso than a cat skeleton looks like a cat, for example.

Your observations were, however, fascinating!
