In the northeast of South America, there lies a sprawling geological formation known as the Guiana Shield; an expanse of 1.7 billion year old rock. Long ago, it was a high plateau of sedimentary stone, but most of it has since been eroded away.

What remains of this ancient highland are immense blocks of sandstone, flattened at the top. The local Pemon people call them tepuis, meaning “houses of the gods”, and there are hundreds of them.

Most tepuis are scattered across Venezuela, but they extend into neighbouring Guyana and Brazil too. Outside of the Andes, these tabletop mountains are among the tallest landforms in South America.

You have Mount Roraima, the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle’s The Lost World:

Auyán-tepui, home to the world’s tallest waterfall:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6060843cea632173f71c45e292475c64-lq)

Cerro Autana, a mountain which has a cave cutting right through it, with an opening on either side:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d934aa4328e1f820f579067cfd21c59b-pjlq)

Sarisariñama, the surface of which is stippled with massive sinkholes:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d891e3bac585e148a4009c16af40e483-pjlq)

And many more. Towering high above the forests and savannahs, surrounded by sheer cliffs on all sides, tepuis are just as remote and inaccessible as islands in the sea; they are effectively islands in the sky. And, just like marine islands, they have a unique array of wildlife which evolved in a vacuum, cut off from the “mainland”.

Before I introduce you too the flora and fauna of these mountains, I’ll go over some of their most interesting physical characteristics which make them such unique environments. Most tepuis are surrounded on all sides by abrupt vertical cliff faces.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f819f5f28dbc5efbe57fea3dde023294-lq)

On top, the terrain varies, but you’ll often find these otherworldly rock formations known as stone forests. Here, the elements have eroded the soluble rock into complex pavements of grooves, pillars and furrows.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-14b64bcec141a52b9375ceca91ba55c4-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f7f95f5dc7104cdfc40061f401038284-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5f0afc98cb3eef5243091f77004542df-lq)

Sometimes, the gouged-out depressions fill up with water, which is then colonized by colourful algae.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-009d18ddb5534bcb82eceb0fc705d1e2-lq)

Erosion has created many other spectacular features on tepuis. There are innumerable caverns beneath the tabletops, most of them unexplored. As they are formed of quartzite, an incredibly hard mineral, they must have taken hundreds of millions of years to form, and may be the oldest caves on Earth.

Some of the chambers are massive (look at the size of the person in the bottom left, below), and one - Abismo Guy Collet - is the deepest cave in all of South America, at a depth of 671 metres. It’s also the world’s deepest quartzite cave.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d0226a6ac3462cb83196c848d594061e-lq)

Inside the caverns, there are subterranean lakes and rivers, bizarre rock formations, ancient microbial growths, and wildlife such as blind fish, scorpions, spiders and giant cave crickets.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-2aba38b99b25ef8d294747081dd53205-pjlq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-714880e2e8dd71f45a4c9ef9c76c9bba-pjlq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-df0460ad3ef2e8b6f333f687cd6b4717-pjlq)

When the rock above these caverns collapse, sinkholes form. There are many sinkholes pockmarking Venezuela’s tepuis, some of them measuring over 300 metres, both in diameter and depth.

Cerro Sarisariñama, a specific tepui, is particularly famous for its holes, which are themselves so isolated that there may be species at the bottom endemic to each particular sinkhole.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1ccca2f11e524b580c4b0da19dc35c16-lq)

And then of course there are the waterfalls. When rivers spill over the edge of the mesas, they form some of the most spectacular falls on Earth. The most well-known is Angel Falls, the world’s tallest waterfall, plunging nearly a kilometre down to the lowlands below.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c01f6cc39f13a3f9486f001962677ab7-lq)

Other notable examples include Kukenán Falls, which isn’t quite as towering, but still extraordinarily tall at 610 metres:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-187ac13ecb616e2172857b35336af932-lq)

And Kaieteur Falls, the world’s largest single-drop waterfall in terms of total volume:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-74594e71518f0d2303461cd479d318a6-lq)

Now, let’s take a look at the wildlife found on these sky islands. In the bare limestone pavements and stone forests, there isn’t much real estate for plant life, but a handful of hardy species eke out an existence in the cracks.

Some plant species here are only found on one particular tepui, and about a third of the total flora is endemic to the Guiana Shield. Bromeliads, close relatives of the pineapple, are especially common.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-65a706d9b257378022fe22b1b0bcd6d4-lq)

The small trees which manage to grow on the rocks, such as Bonnetia roraimae, are quite alien indeed.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-27b6fdf48cb77187d0cafd1977bf0685-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ba820ccff8876b82861d0efa2da0d92b-lq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5e80b89c031fe11efccb1ae39fed9078-lq)

The reddish colour of their leaves is due to anthocyanin pigments, which help protect them against extremes of weather. The red-brown hue of the vegetation on some tepuis can even be seen from space:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-24cb0b17ac522c97f2cfd274d34ff9e3-pjlq)

Another thing about these rocky areas is that what soil there is is very thin and poor in nutrients. As a result, some plants use an alternative source of nutrition - animals. Carnivorous flora is common here, including pitcher plants which drown insects in digestive nectar:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b02acf9be2183e17c0e1d81c92b6c285-pjlq)

And sundews. Their leaves are covered in mucus-coated hairs, and when flies get stuck in the secretion, the leaf rolls up, constricting the prey and slowly digesting it.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-98df90397ee07af881d71b53f2017b18-lq)

The conditions atop tepuis are not always so unforgiving, however. Some summits feature shrublands, savannahs, and dense tropical forests.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-708ad11fbe510971bb638020106a29b8)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d8907b772ef8327332908fd9446023db-pjlq)

Then there’s the animal inhabitants. Just like the plants, tepui fauna shows high levels of endemism, meaning that many species are found nowhere else. The limited space and scarcity of food mean that there aren’t any very big animals atop the plateaus, but there’s still plenty of fascinating wildlife.

Although colonist species from the lowlands probably do come in every now and then, most of the wildlife on the tepuis is likely descended from animals that were there before the surrounding land was eroded away. Their ecosystems guarded by sheer cliffs, said animals evolved in isolation from the rest of the world.

Let’s start with the endemic birds. This includes the tepui tinamou, an elusive ground-dwelling bird:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-429f3a10e8de82dcc629f520ee29264c-lq)

The Roraiman nightjar, which is nocturnal:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-139fa99f029b3a01974f895e2554bcb8-lq)

A wide variety of hummingbirds, including the tepui goldenthroat and the peacock coquette (pictured):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-fc7f0ff6acd037b9330991abe60628a5-lq)

The tepui parrotlet, which commutes between mountaintops in flocks of several hundred:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-92f2068025732aec52497839291cb4ec-lq)

The greater flowerpiecer, often found on the barren karst rocks, which perforates the base of flowers to access nectar:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-566711fc0d19b005f5038f624ce95ce1-lq)

The colourful tepui brushfinch:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-ccb806a15ea9fd2ed82249fd846d6627-lq)

And many birds in the group Tyranni, such as the Roraiman antwren:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-195f37161f9c8a5632f28e2fb6f9d518-lq)

And the striking scarlet-horned manakin, which has a pair of feathery tufts on its head (its “horns”):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-96e08565a494d2b6fc00230d990b7e82-lq)

While the forested foothills of the mesas are rich in mammal fauna, the challenging conditions at the top (and the inaccessibility) mean that there aren’t many mammals here. Those that are are usually quite small.

Some endemic examples include Tyler’s mouse-opossum, which I don’t think has ever been photographed (a close relative is shown):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-73ee189cc08d56afafec5d40ee574320-lq)

McConnell's climbing rat (again, a closely related species is is shown below):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-29aa7f2697df6cca428b259aedb6abf6-lq)

Isabelle’s ghost bat (again, not the exact same species in the photo):

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7b6bbdebddd316be36a27cd7d2d78c5d-lq)

And the prickly Roraima mouse, which was thought extinct until its rediscovery in 2009. The picture is correct this time.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-41757d2752767112cd2e2648ba226999-lq)

What’s especially interesting about this mouse is that its closest genetic relatives are not found on the lowlands surrounding the tepuis, but way over atop the Brazilian Shield on the other side of the Amazon Basin. This is because its ancestors inhabited a vast South American plateau which has now been mostly eroded. In the remaining Guianan and Brazilian shields, this lineage of mice has survived.

There are only two “large" animals which are definitively known to live on top of tepuis: the brown-nosed coati and the southern tamandua, a species of anteater. We have photographic evidence in both cases.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9de74e5a9ed6ef0b2db31236ba8de148-pjlq)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6f0c5c07c78a0de592e4b84abea7b092-pjlq)

There are, however, reports of giant anteaters, pale-throated sloths and even jaguars from the summits. None of these animals have been observed here in modern times, though, and the last claim is especially dubious.

Now for the herpetofauna; the reptiles and amphibians. There are many endemic species, including an incredible diversity of frogs, of which 90 percent are endemic, but not too many which really stand out.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-6e13f3eb2c0b7943bdf03fa17c07fa08-lq)

I will however mention a few, such as the lizard Pantepuisaurus rodriguesi. It's not just an endemic species, but a whole unique genus, found only on tepuis.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9ed4d405df304c1fcf77937aae0568c6-lq)

Its close relative, Riolama inopinata, is also endemic, and has a striking red colouration.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-94b12c1858dadc85952cccd332d03e1f-pjlq)

There's also the Neblina anole, a fairly large lizard which can extend a brightly coloured dewlap from its throat:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-31e70b9142e480305a8d872216efd462-pjlq)

The Roraima bush toad, a creature that — when threatened — curls up and rolls away:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c6d9126ed46f8abe1a98c044cfbd2e54-pjlq)

And the tepui treefrog, which carries its young on its back.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-dcf89777c8479e0935cdb4efce215b4f-pjlq)

The last component of the tepui wildlife left to review is the invertebrate fauna. There are countless endemic beetles, snails, butterflies, and even aquatic insects and crustaceans in underground rivers.

The only endemic arthropod species which I find particularly noteworthy are an assortment of freshwater crabs recently discovered in the mountains' forests.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bc91180274bc6d85bf96247695e8e381-pjlq)

So, that's basically everything you need to know about these extraordinary evolutionary laboratories. There is doubtless much left to discover here; many tepuis have long been near-impossible to access even by helicopter, but they're beginning to reveal their secrets.

Thank you everyone for reading! I had a lot of fun composing this answer, so hopefully you'll get some enjoyment out of it.

Great post! My undergrad botany prof used to take yearly 4–6 month sabbaticals to the Tepuis. He’d come back and give lectures on all the new plant species they’d found and their very unique adaptations. He reckoned they’d only scratched the surface of what was to be discovered. Of course that was ove…

```
Freaky! I never knew about such unusual places on Earth. They really are like islands in the sky. Thank you for such a well-illustrated and informed answer.
```

```
VERY interesting! I sincerely hope some yahoos don’t figure out how to lift vehicles up there and start touring around and creating trails. Some places should be just left untouched by humans.

Edit suggestion:

Before I introduce you to the flora and fauna …

Then there are the animal inhabitants.

Simply amazing and slightly sobering, as a species, we spend years gazing at the stars, wondering what's out there when we still have so much on our own planet we know little about. As a side note, some of these locations are so awe inspiring, I'm thinking of using some of them as inspiration for DnD…

It has been a while since I last enjoyed learning about something completely new to me as much as I did reading this. Wonderful answer, thank you.
```

```
One of the best and most comprehensive answers I’ve seen on quora.
```

```
Astonishing!
```

```
I feel like I just watched Nat Geo’s version of “UP”. What a wonderful answer!
```

```
Wonderful, thank you Gary! 🤗
```

```
Awesome answer!
```

```
Wow, very catchy particularly those exotic plants. Strange geography and them make these photos looks like taken from the alien world. I’m just sliding the Quora newsfeed while dealing with some stress in my head. This is only comment which makes me forget that f**king stress. Thank you so much.
```

```
Fascinating, I take it no humans live on any of these?
```

```
Such a great report. Thank you very much 👍🙏🌍🌎
```

```
Very interesting. Thank you for teaching me something new today 😊
```

```
Really impressive. You should compile a book on this and make some money. I had never heard of these areas. Thanks so much for educating us.
```

```
Awesome. I wish I could go there.
```

```
Wow thanks! This is like a PhD thesis!
```

```
Maybe you should write a book. You’ve put together an awful lot of information about a beautiful but widely unknown part of the world. It’s history is fascinating and the life on the tepuis is unusual and a has many lessons in evolution, genetics and how “life finds a way”. Excellent work, highly rec…
```

```
great stuff, bookmarked for future reference, thanks
```

```
Wow, fantastically interesting! Thanks for putting all that together!
```

```
Sorry to add yet more congratulations - you must be getting fed up with them by now - but that was truly the best Quora answer I've read.

Thank you for a comprehensive introduction to this area I'd never heard of before (which is strange since I'd heard of the 3 waterfalls you mentioned).

Thank you again.
```

```
Wow! I never knew about these kind of places. I could only imagine what it would be like to explore these habitats. Awesome post!
```

```
Thank you very much for that piece of work. Your photos and text make me feel feel as if was there. Wonderful and beautiful.
```

```
Great answer. Thanks so much for this introduction to a fascinating part of our planet!
```

```
Now we know where the inspiration for the animated film “Up” is!
```

```
Up! We're only missing Kevin! Paradise Falls
.
```

```
I am blown away by this answer - amazing information and really well written! Thank you so much for putting the effort in to compile this!
```

```
Thanks, I was completely immersed, thanks again for a great composition.
```

```
Absolutely best answer on Quora in a long time. Bookmarked and will share

Thank you
```

```
Thank you for a well composed and informative answer. You have added to my day and life.
```

```
There are similar shaped plateau features in Washington State caused by ice age floods. What caused these formations?
```

```
This is awesome! I truly hope it will be made more accessible to the likes of regular visitors (like me) during my lifetime (even for just a tiny itsy slice of this wonder).
```

```
A fine example of Quora at its very best.

Thank you.
```

```
Thank you, this has given me a “need" to read more on the subject.
```

```
What a great read, awesome job!
```

```
Impressive, most impressive!

Excellent review, beautiful landscapes and captivating text.

Thank you!

Let’s hope we keep those amazing sacred places intact.
```

Knock out n detailed presentation. Well done
```

```
Gary, thank you so much for this piece! It’s truly a compelling read. Well done!

As a Venezuelan I can say this answer is as correct as it is beautiful . Thank you
```

```
What a delightful reading! Thanks for this!
```

```
Magical place, truly stunning. Hope to visit it one day; few things impressed me more as a child than a two-page photo of the Angel Falls in an atlas.
```

```
I expected Dug to be sitting there wagging his tail saying “Are you my new master. I love you.”
```

```
Fascinating!
```

```
The most interesting thing I have read on Quora in ages! Thank you!
```

```
Thank you so much i throughly enjoyed reading it. I was educated about a part of the earth i knew nothing about and it was very intriguing. So much in-fact i’d love to visit it.😍
```

```
Impressive! There's enough material here for a book.
```

```
This is the most interesting read I have had on Quora. Thank you.
```

Possibly one of *the* best Quora replies I have *ever* had the pleasure to read. I was lucky enough to trek to Salto Angel 15 years ago and met a couple of scientists who had spent a serious amount of time just exploring only one of the many tepuis in the area. We had an amazing Pemone guide, who ex…

100 up votes if I could. Thanks for putting together an excellent summary of a previously unknown & interesting topic!

I thought I was reading a book halfway through. A well written and detailed book. I still don't remember what the question was and I'm not interested in that anymore. Thanks for this! It was an awesome read.
```

```
Really cool stuff, as usual, professor
```

```
I am grateful there are people like, you writing answers like this. Great read!
```

Fascinating, thanks for putting that together
```

```
Thanks for sharing. We live on an amazing planet. And as a species, we need to appreciate it.

Read The Lost World back in school but had no idea the world it was based on was so unique! Great answer and pics thanks!!
```

```
Amazing, thanks! Half of those photos looked like pictures from another planet. Bookmarked.
```

```
That was one of the most comprehensive answers I’ve ever seen on Quora!
```

```
This was very informative. I hope you will publish it somewhere as a stand-alone article.
```

```
Thank you very well done.
```

```
Possibly the best answer I've read yet! What an amazing part of the world. Most importantly, thanks for the vacation. I haven't traveled lately and this was beyond exotic.
```

```
Thank you so much! What a fascinating reveal.
```

```
Wow, where did you get all these images and info from?
```

```
Very interesting, Thank you!
```

```
Superb answer!
```

Now, I just discovered a new bucket list! Thank you!
```

```
This… THIS is what Quora is for.
```

```
Best Quora post I have ever read. You’ve revived my respect in this forum.
```

```
Wonderful answer, fascinating to read, and great pictures! Thanks so much!
```

```
Excellent answer!
```

```
Great answer. I have a hunch Pixar knows about this place.
```

```
This was excellent information, thank you! Wonderful to learn about such spots, hopefully they stay “endemic” and aren’t obliterated by any of various human interventions (direct action, climate change, etc) from their sustained state of millenia!
```

```
Probably the best answer I’ve ever read on Quora. THANK YOU!
```

```
Great answer. I wasn’t really aware of tepuis. Thank you for taking the time to write this.
```

```
Great article. I had to share it on fb. And following!
```

```
Many thanks for compiling the info into a very readable post. Tremendously enjoyed your “article”. Kudos.

Just fantastic. Thanks.

Thank-you so much for this wonderful, beautifully illustrated article. Fascinating and utterly amazing.
```

```
Fantastic answer! Thank you!
```

```
Absolutely fascinating … thank you so much!
```

```
Most informational - a whole 'nutha Earth. What's most interesting to me is that the stone forests resemble massive groupings of people - lots-wife like.
```

```
This is by far the best answer on Quora I’ve ever read. Extremely well done!

It is my dream to visit this area someday. But I guess it’s not very likely.
```

```
I love stuff like this. Well done, thanks for sharing.
```

```
Thank you for this, Gary. Gosh, the nostalgia! Back in 1983, when the first tv documentary cameras went to Roirama I used their material to teach ecology in my high school. My students were fascinated, as I was. Knowledge like this never fails to work when teaching! Cheers from Roy.
```

```
Wow, thank you for a very thorough study on tepuis; this is definitely an ecosystem that few have even heard about, yet sounds so wonderful.
```

```
Amazing answer. Thank you for your research work!
```

You've been waiting a long time for that question to be asked huh :)

Wonderful to see such passion within an intriguing habitat
```

```
What, no dinosaurs roaming around on top? I am disappoint.
```

```
Awesome!
```

```
Excellent answer!
```

```
Very informative. Thank you.
```

```
Very interesting. Thank you. I hope we can keep away from this becoming a “tourist attraction” and leave it alone.
```

```
Thank you! That is a fascinating read and I appreciate your work in compiling it. Let us hope mankind does not spoil these places.
```

```
Great post, definitely worth bookmarking.
```

```
Pretty. Where are the dinosaurs?
```

```
What a wonderfully interesting answer. Thanks for all of your work.
```

```
Thanks a lot for the comprehensive information. There is an old National Geographic publication on the subject that was covering the Venezuelan side, however it was not as far reaching as your article.

Great work!!
```

```
A question for the OP,Gary Meany, of the most secure and inaccessible tabletops what their relative size,say to well known islands?

```

Probably the best Quora answer I’ve read. Thank you

You put a lot of work in this answer and it’s truly commendable. I have to say it’s been a very long time since any Quora answer has been so good that engaged me to read till the end, despite being lengthy.

Wow looks like a bucket list destination! Thanks
```

```
Wow! Those photos are amazing! Thank you for posting them and for the science along with the pics.
```

```
I was totally caught up in this answer, then had to find out who - of COURSE it was you, Gary.
Always a guarantee of a great read.
```

```
Great answer. I believe these flat-topped formations were the inspiration for Arthur Conan Doyle's 1912 novel “The Lost World” which in turn inspired many film and TV adaptations.
```

```
Don’t they also show up on the animation “Up”?
```

```
Why are the birds endemic? The flightless ones aside, what stops them flying down or out of these places?
```

```
sundew hairs aren’t mucus-covered… (I know we have them all over where I live in Australia) they are in fact carbohydrate-covered, in mucilage (as this is plant-made, not animal). So it would be a better edit to say “mucus-like carbohydrate” or mucilage.
```

```
Where does all the water for those waterfalls come from?
```

```
Would it be extremely hard for someone to live there?
```

```
It's been my dream to go see the Angel Falls once in my lifetime.

Excellent answer. It is like a breath of fresh air in the middle of all those facebook-instagram type answers.

Thank you Gary for investing your time and sharing this with us.
```

```
The environment shown in Up?
```

```
These here are the most interesting and beautiful pictures. I did not know about these Tepui Plato's. I thank You very much.
```

```
This is why I read Quora….

I have the opportunity to learn about things I would have most likely never would have otherwise.

Great post!
```

```
Great Article, one of the best i went thru so far

Thank u for ur contribution & efforts
```

```
Haven't read all 300+ comments, but you should make a documentary of some kind. Great article, Gary!
```

```
Believe it or not, i always believe such island in the clouds is already explored by dozens of our ancestors, but they choose to leave no trace but story of fairies they tell their grandchildren. Thats how we heard about legends of goddes who lives above the clouds…
```

```
#SCIENCEhumanitysONLYhope! #SAVEourPLANET #SAVEourWILDLIFE

Awesome answer.

By all accounts, after reading your answer, looks like the animation movie Up is set here.

Wow! Thank you so much for sharing this intel and the images. Crazy to think that there are flies even in this remote biosphere. They are everywhere! The Tipper plants are awesome! Thank you, muito obrigada!
