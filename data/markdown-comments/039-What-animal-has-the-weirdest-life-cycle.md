A lot of great answers here, but I’ll chime in with the paradoxical frog, Pseudis paradoxa. To give a bit of background, this frog is a creature which inhabits South America, especially the Amazon basin and the great Pantanal wetland. While technically in the tree frog family, it spends most of its time in the water.

Here’s an adult P. paradoxa:

Overall, it looks fairly standard for a frog. They usually measure around 4.5 to 6.5 centimetres in length, occasionally pushing 7.5. Again, fairly standard dimensions. The female frog will lay her eggs in some water plants, and eventually they’ll hatch as tadpoles.

But these are no ordinary tadpoles.

They’re absolutely giant - 22–25 centimetres long! Now, they’re not the biggest tadpoles - huge larvae are typical of the Pseudis genus - but what’s really amazing is their size compared to the adults. They’re 3–4 times longer.

So, when these pollywogs metamorphose, they gradually decrease in size until they’re a quarter of their original length! It’s this incredible life history which has earned the species the alternative name of “shrinking frog”.

A note - paradoxical frogs aren’t entirely unique in this shrinking business. Off the top of my head, goliath beetles are another example (the larvae are up to 25 cm, the adults from 5–11). However, insects are always weird; I think that the fact that a fellow tetrapod does this makes it even more amazing.

Aside from the wings, neary every butterfly/moth larvae are larger than the adult…
