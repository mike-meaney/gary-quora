On the border between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda is Africa’s highest mountain range - the Rwenzori Mountains. While Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya stand taller, they are freestanding volcanoes not part of any range.

The highest peak in the range - Mount Stanley - is 5,109 metres above sea level, and covered in snow year-round. The Rwenzori Mountains are one of the only places in Africa where you can see glaciers, although many of these have shrunk at an alarming rate in the last century.

The Rwenzori Mountains are part of a larger area of mountainous terrain known as the Albertine Rift. This is the western arm of the Great Rift Valley, and contains more endemic species than almost anywhere in East Africa. Speaking of species, let’s look at the wildlife.

In the mountain range, you can see some bizarre, larger-than-life plants, such as the giant groundsel:

The giant lobelia:

And the giant heather. This 6 metre tall tree is the largest species of heather in the world, and forms forests which are usually festooned with heavy clumps of moss.

Amongst the strange plants live many large mammals, such as African forest elephants, chimpanzees, hyraxes, duiker antelope and several species of monkey. Due to the isolation created by the mountains, there are many animal species found only in the Albertine Rift. You can find 19 of the birds - and 4 of the mammals - endemic to the Albertine Rift in the Rwenzori Mountains .

The endemic fauna includes the Rwenzori turaco:

The Rwenzori red duiker:

The handsome spurfowl:

And the strange weaver:

And, to top it all off, the scenery is simply breathtaking. A picture speaks a thousand words, so I’m going to leave the photos to do the talking:

Despite all this, the Rwenzori Mountains receive very little attention from tourists. For the conservation-minded, me among them of course, this is great, because it means that the countless precious endemics are unsullied by human activity.

Nevertheless, you’d wonder why they’re so rarely visited. Of course, travel in the DR Congo is unadvisable, but Uganda - where the eastern flank of the range is located - is a safe and secure country, perfect for tourism.

Wow, a new place to dream about! Have you been there?
```

Great post. I’ve visited Virunga and climbed slightly south of here, up Nyirangongo. A trek to the Rwenzori range would be the trip of a lifetime.
```

```
Our earth is truly a marvellous place and it’s people like you that bring it to the rest of us, for which I thank you
```

```
As strange (and possibly offensive) as this sounds, I really do hope your post doesn’t get too much attention. Last thing we need is a horde of tourists wrecking the place! (though yeah: I’ve been wanting to go there, due to the Geology of the region. TBH, all Africa is fascinating Geologically. And…
```

```
Yes, the Mountains of the Moon. What a beautiful name…
```

```
What makes the strange weaver strange?
```

```
You have very interesting posts… a lot of research goes into them. Thank you!
```

y’know, if you showed 100 people the first picture: the snow-capped mountain range with the stream in the foreground, and then asked them to pick the continent where the picture was taken, I’ll bet none of them would say Africa. (I sure wouldn’t.)
```

So beautiful!
```

```
Beautiful pictures! I’ve hiked the Rwenzoris and recommend them 100%. They are every bit as gorgeous as your photos show.
```

```
Marvelous images.
```

```
Wow you just put Uganda on my bucketlist.
```

```
The giant lobelia… hmmmmm… is the rest of the giant underground?
```

```
Well, the gay death penalty in Uganda does put a bit of a damper on any potential travel plans for my husband and I, but otherwise, absolutely, perfect for tourism. I have a co -worker from there, I do hope I get to visit someday.

```
Excellent answer rwensori and tobcal are the most underrated range mountains in Africa or atlas to be more specific
```

```
It is a really difficult part of the world to travel in. Unpaved roads that turn into deep mud in the rainy season, no roads in other areas. Never mind some bandit groups operating around the border area with the DRC.

Pictures 10 and 11 are mountains in New Zealand, Mount Sefton and the Darran Mountains respectively.

More background candidates!
