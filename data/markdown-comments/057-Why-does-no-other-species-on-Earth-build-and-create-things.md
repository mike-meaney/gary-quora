In the Caatinga of Brazil, there is a complex of termite mounds, constructed by the species Syntermes dirus. It is quite similar to any other typical termite colony, except this colony is approximately the size of Great Britain.

Covering an area of roughly 228,000 square kilometres, this immense complex contains over 200 million mounds, each 10 meters in diameter and 3 meters tall. The termites have excavated about 10 billion cubic metres of soil, and so Herculean a feat this was that it took them nearly 4,000 years to construct.

This is a construction on a grander scale than virtually any structure humans have built. And all this by creatures tens of millions of times smaller than us! Someone who wonders if other animals can build things would, by their logic, also wonder if humans can.

This is absolutely fascinating. Thanks for sharing this new discovery. I was wondering why their structures are so relatively uniform as compared to human cities with buildings of all sorts of sizes and shapes. Also when you wrote it took 4000 years to build, did you mean it took that long to grow to…

Humans are still the undisputed champs of asking self-aggrandizing questions on Quora though. Suck it, termites!
```

Another great architects of nature are honeybees. They make perfect hexagons hanging down a tree. The beehives they build are way more complex than any commercial building.
```

```
How do the termites manage to find enough food? It looks like there’s probably a lot more termites than wood in that last picture!
```

```
That last line was so poetic! Wow! The rest of it was awesome too, but that last line just set this answer on fire!
```

```
That mounds should also be protected from future human encroachment…
```

```
My math may be off but I don’t think a termite is ‘tens of millions of times smaller’ than a human. Maybe tens of thousands.
```

```
They may be able to build larger structures than us,but they can’t come onto Quora to rub our faces in it.
```

```
How are termites tens of millions of times smaller than us?!
```

```
Also beavers make dams, birds make nests, bees make hives, spiders make webs… I’m not sure where does one take ‘animals don’t build stuff’ from!
```

```
Are all the mounds inhabited? What do they eat?
```

```
I think you need to get outside your building more to look around. Modern humans have only destroyed stuff, hardly created.
```

```
But, can you see them from space?
```

```
Are these mounds still occupied?
```

```
That’s extremely impressive but I don’t get the 10,000 cubic metres….? At 10m diameter and 3m high each mound has an approximate volume of only 78 cubic metres.
