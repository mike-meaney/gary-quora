Yes, such plants are called pyrophiles.

A pyrophile is a type of pyrophyte (fire-tolerant plant) which requires fire in order to complete its cycle of reproduction. Most pyrophiles are grasses, I believe, but there are pyrophilic trees - for example, the coastal redwood Sequoia sempervirens.

First of all, let me explain serotiny. Serotinous plants are ones which rely on an external factor to trigger the release of their seeds; for pyrophiles, that trigger is fire. In other examples of serotiny, it can be flooding or rainfall.

When forest fires occur in sequoia forests, they may appear to be wholly destructive forces, and indeed many trees are burnt to crisps. However, sequoias have fireproof bark which shields them from any infernos.

What the bark also does is channel the heat upwards, towards the sequoias’ cones. The cones’ openings are sealed shut with tree resin, but the flames melt this resin and allow the seeds to be released.

When the seeds fall to the ground, they find a perfect place to grow. There’s plenty of space now that so many trees are burnt up, and that also means there’s little competition. The fire breaks down locked-up nutrients inside the trees and recycles them into the soil, ready to be taken up by the seedlings.

Plenty of pyrophile trees in Australia. Mostly Eucalypts but plenty of Acacias as well.

Wow! I am a nature enthusiast and I have never heard of anything like this before. Thanks for sharing, mate.

interesting that nature has many self renewing properties

This is some crazy shit Sequoias play

A few comments: 1. The photo is of giant sequoias, Sequoiadendron giganteum, not coast redwoods. 2. Giant sequoia is the redwood species whose cones are serotinous and open after a fire. Coast redwood cones open even without fire, but the seeds need a mineral seedbed. On a practical level that mostly occurs…

Nice explanation!

I believe it would be worth talking about the, practically, opposed process:

Vernalization - Wikipedia

When a plant or seed needs a period of cold -even freezing- temperatures to flourish.

The tannins in their bark help, too, I’ve heard.
```

```
Isn’t the Giant Sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) more of a pyrophile than the Coastal Redwood?
```

```
Sequoias using dumping practices before it was cool.
```

```
Fascinating!
