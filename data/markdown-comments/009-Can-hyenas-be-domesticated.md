## The Hyena City of Ethiopia

In the walled town of Harar, Ethiopia, the locals have a curious and starkly unique relationship with local spotted hyenas.

There are currently two hyena feeding places which tourists can visit, at the shrines of Aw Sofi and Aw Aboker respectively. (I’ve heard that the latter one is more formal, more touristy, and - to a degree - more contrived). At these places, “hyena men” throw scraps of meat to wild hyenas which have become habituated to this and come to the feeding places on a nightly basis.

At the Aboker feeding places, visitors can even have hyenas pull meat from their mouths.

This tradition, which started about sixty years ago, is by no means just a tourist attraction. At night, many Harari butchers throw their leftovers out onto the streets to waiting hyenas, with no tourists in sight. The hyenas of Harar are said to be special (and that is why they behave so peacefully), for they have become vessels through which one can communicate with saints. They’re also believed to eat malevolent demons - jinn - and when a hyena attacks a human, it is because that person was possessed by one.

Then there’s this annual festival called Ashura, held on a hilltop outside the town. Three mounds of porridge are laid out on a broad, flat stone, and the attendants wait for hyenas to come out and eat it. It’s kind of like the Harari version of groundhog day - if the hyena eats most of the porridge but leaves a bit, the coming year will be prosperous. If he eats it all, there will be famine, and if he eats little, war.

Anyway, virtually all the locals at Harar adore hyenas, so much so that if a hyena kills one of their livestock, many put it down to themselves not feeding it enough. If only American ranchers had this attitude to wolves.

Similarly, the hyenas have become fully habituated to the local traditions and have very little fear of people, especially people they know well. Dogs were probably domesticated by starting out eating human scraps - interestingly similar to what’s going in in Harar.

If this ritual was to continue for centuries, I could easily see spotted hyenas becoming a domesticated animal. The most habituated individuals are the ones most likely to come for food and gain a selective advantage, so over time they will get more and more familiar with humans until they’re practically dogs.

Something similar is happening with urban foxes in the UK - many answer to names, come when called and beg for treats, and of course those who do get more food and so have more babies. And it would be greatly to hyaenas’ advantage to be domesticated, as their peculiar reproductive system mean that m…

Well you wouldnt take no crap from those stuck up pit bull owners with tatts and a bad attitude if you walk down the road with a hyena on a leash.

That would be fun.

Until one day it forgets its domesticated and its too far to walk to the chow bowl - and you are closer.

+1. Some people are just very good at understanding animals. Joseph Carter the Mink Man extensively describes the process for taming minks, which are probably even more difficult than hyenas. Instead of being pack hunters, minks are highly territorial solitary carnivores. Hyenas are beggars in Harar.…

I can imagine the questions in Quora after the domestication of hyenas. The most popular question would be “Will my pet hyena eat my body if die at home?” and there would be tons of answers that would begin like “Hyenas are scavengers in the wild…”

I never realized just how BIG a hyena is! And the bigger heavier ones are probably female since it’s a matriarchal society. I wonder who was the first person who went out amongst the clan and hand fed them. They were either really tough or really crazy!

Hyenas are really smart.

I love all sorts of animals, but I am deathly afraid of Hyenas. This is the most horrific thing I have ever seen. I think that I need to lie down . . .

Thanks for sharing? :-)

Was there a segment about this on Planet Earth 2? I remember seeing this on one of the documentaries.

My daughter and I visited this town about six years ago. Car headlights lit up the area and the hyenas were probably no more than 20 feet away from where the town's visitors were pressed up against the walls of buildings watching the hyenas being fed. After the feeding, the hyenas just disappeared i…

I participated in the hyena feeding in Harar, in fact with the exact same fellow in the first photo. His name is Muhammad. It was a great experience.

In large aquariums, divers hand feed sharks. The sharks leave the divers alone; they just want the food.

Fascinating. Fantastic contribution to Quora.

Intriguing! I love this answer.

And a hundred years from now we’ll be seeing Hyenas in pug form with birthday caps atop their heads.

Up to a certain point, that’s what’s happening to coyotes as well, in parts of Canada and the USA: they’ve become so habituated to human presence they actually live in dark alleys, opened sewer manholes and abandoned buildings, and get out at night to eat garbage and unsuspecting domestic cats/dogs…

My best friend is Ethiopian. He said in his city they are taught not to go out at night alone because of the hyenas and like most he fears them. He went to this town before and fed a hyena using his mouth like in one of the pictures. He said it was both terrifying and also almost cathartic; that it…

This is absolutely crazy, but it also makes sense… the animals are treated with respect & learn the humans bring benefits… And that that's likely how dogs became domesticated. I once read that hyenas are one of the animals that have never been successfully domesticated… but here is evidence that its (…

I’ve heard of hyenas being described as ugly but now that I’ve seen these pictures I’m not so sure. They look….rather sweet. If one came and leaned against my shoulder begging for food like the picture at the bottom, I’d happily feed him.

Just like their relatives, cats, hyenas are deciding we would be good servants.
```

```
Could I assume that the crime rate at night is very low? If you are doing something that you are not supposed to be doing, you get eaten by hyenas but you are possessed by a demon so everything is ok. Works for me.
```

```
But hyenas are much closer, genetically, to cats, than dogs. And it's clear to any cat lover that while domestic cats are domesticated, they're far less so than dogs.
```

```
Fascinatingly enough, that echos the leading theory of how dogs were domesticated thousands of years ago. We tend to think we took wolf puppies from the killed parents and raised them as our own. But research likely indicates that wolves domesticated themselves. Wolves would scavenge and eat the scr…

but are they selectvily breeding the hyena? that is how you start domestication process. by playing match maker for them. spotted hyenas have complex social behaviors
